A further 190,475 immunocompromised individuals, or 0.8% of the population, have received a weakened version of the booster dose. 93.72% of those who are eligible for the first booster dose have received it.[4] On 3 March 2021 the first shipment of the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was delivered. The 117,000 doses are part of the 10 million doses of the vaccine that the Taiwanese government had previously ordered.[5] On 18 March the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved by the government,[6] and vaccinations commenced on 22 March 2021. The vaccine is free for all Taiwanese people and long-term residents.[7] Health workers, other frontline workers and seniors were the first to be inoculated with the vaccine.[8] On 5 May the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use,[9] and the first batch of 150,000 doses was delivered on 28 May 2021.[10] On 17 May 400,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that were ordered through COVAX arrived in the midst of Taiwan's largest COVID-19 pandemic.[11] On 31 May Taiwan Centers for Disease Control announced that 10 million doses of domestically produced vaccines (Medigen and United Biomedical) had been pre-reserved. 5 million of each vaccine were reserved. They are expected to be approved and deployed sometime in July 2021.[12][13] On 2 June Taiwan recorded the first case of blood clotting linked to the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination.[14] On 4 June Japan donated 1.24 million doses of the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to Taiwan.[15] On 6 June three American senators who arrived in Taiwan announced that the United States will donate 750,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan, the brand of which is still currently unknown.[16] On 20 June 2.5 million Moderna vaccine doses arrived, which represented an increase from the 750,000 doses pledged. The doses arrived on a China Airlines flight from Memphis.[17] On 18 June Taiwan Centers for Disease Control announced that a second shipment of 240,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine were set to arrive in Taiwan from Luxembourg.[18] On 22 June the government of Lithuania announced that it was donating 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in September.

Despite signing the deal with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, an agreement has been made that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines would be manufactured and shipped directly from Germany.[23] The deal has been widely seen as a compromise between multiple parties. The Tsai Administration, which was strictly against the importation of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines in Taiwan, has successfully secured direct access to German manufactured Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group is able to maintain the legitimacy of their license and distribution rights in China, SAR Hong Kong, SAR Macau, and Taiwan.[23] On 13 July Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center announced that all residents and nationals of Taiwan who were born in or before 2003 would be eligible for making appointments on the Taiwanese COVID-19 vaccination platform, marking the next stage of Taiwan's domestic wide COVID-19 vaccination.[24] On 15 July Taiwan received three shipments of COVID-19 vaccines.

The Medigen COVID-19 vaccine is the first domestic COVID-19 vaccine that was given EUA approval by the Taiwanese government and the first in the world. Despite the vaccine has proven to be safe through its Phase 2 clinical trial, the approval was still considered a controversial political move due to the lack of efficacy data and Phase 3 clinical-trial.[26] On 21 July the Tzu Chi Foundation announced they had reached final agreements and signed a deal with Fosun Pharma to purchase 5 million doses of Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The 5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine would be donated to Taiwan's CDC for Taiwan's domestic vaccination plan.

The first four batches of Medigen COVID-19 vaccine includes a total of 265,568 doses, which will be use for Taiwan's domestic vaccination starting in August.[32] On 8 August Taiwan received 99,600 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

The 930,000 doses of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was the first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that Taiwan received and were part of the 15 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine donation made by Foxconn, TSMC, and Tzu-chi Foundation.
