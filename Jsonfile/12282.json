{"Content: ":"Preventable causes of death are causes of death related to risk factors which could have been avoided.[1] The World Health Organization has traditionally classified death according to the primary type of disease or injury. However, causes of death may also be classified in terms of preventable risk factors\u2014such as smoking, unhealthy diet, sexual behavior, and reckless driving\u2014which contribute to a number of different diseases. Such risk factors are usually not recorded directly on death certificates, although they are acknowledged in medical reports. It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds\u2014100,000 per day\u2014die of age-related causes.[2] In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90 percent.[2] Thus, albeit indirectly, biological aging (senescence) is by far the leading cause of death. Whether senescence as a biological process itself can be slowed, halted, or even reversed is a subject of current scientific speculation and research.[3] Risk factors associated with the leading causes of preventable death worldwide as of the year 2001, according to researchers working with the Disease Control Priorities Network (DCPN)[4]:[5] By contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2008 statistics list only causes of death, and not the underlying risk factors. In 2001, on average 29,000 children died of preventable causes each day (that is, about 20 deaths per minute). The authors provide the context: About 56 million people died in 2001. Of these, 10.6 million were children, 99% of whom lived in low-and-middle-income countries. More than half of child deaths in 2001 were attributable to acute respiratory infections, measles, diarrhea, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.[5] The three risk factors most commonly leading to preventable death in the population of the United States are smoking, high blood pressure, and being overweight.[6] Pollution from fossil fuel burning kills roughly 200,000/year.[1] Leading preventable causes of death in the United States in the year 2000.[7] Note: This data is outdated and has been significantly revised, especially for obesity-related deaths.[6] Leading causes of accidental death in the United States by age group as of 2002[update].[8] Leading causes of accidental death in the United States as of 2002[update], as a percentage of deaths in each group.[8]  Various injuries are the leading cause of death in children 9\u201317 years of age. In 2008, the top five worldwide unintentional injuries in children are as follows:[17] 260,000 per year 175,000 per year 96,000 per year 47,000 per year 45,000 per year","Title":"Preventable causes of death - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12282","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventable_causes_of_death"}
