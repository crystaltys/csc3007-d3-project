The GHRHR activates a Gs protein that causes a cascade of cAMP via adenylate cyclase.[5] This gene, expressed in the pituitary, encodes a receptor for growth-hormone-releasing hormone. Binding of this hormone to the receptor leads to synthesis and release of growth hormone. Mutations in this gene have been associated with isolated growth-hormone deficiency (IGHD), also known as Dwarfism of Sindh, a disorder characterized by short stature. Many alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been described, but only two have been characterized to date.[6] This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.
