{"Content: ":"DW News is a global English-language news TV program broadcast by German public international broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW). The first program aired the summer of 2015. DW is funded by the German government and is barred from broadcasting in Germany itself.[citation needed] DW News was launched on 22 June 2015 and replaced DW programs like Journal.[1] The 24-hour service aims to be a German counterpart to international news channels from other countries, such as BBC World News or France 24. The service is transmitted worldwide via satellite. DW has also launched its news website online and a YouTube channel in Hindi as well.[2] A Turkish YouTube channel with the title DW Türkçe[1] is available since April 19, 2011.[3] In the United States, DW News is aired at the top of the hour. In some areas (like Northern California), it is re-broadcast by public media broadcasts. A 30-minute program similar to Journal is broadcast by many PBS member stations. The 30-minute program is also available nationwide on Link TV,[4] as well as on YouTube as DW English and DW Documentary. A DW livestream is available on DW´s website.[5] In Australia it is broadcast live overnight on ABC News and on SBS as part of WorldWatch programming or instead of missing or removed programs.","Title":"DW News - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16151","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DW_News"}
