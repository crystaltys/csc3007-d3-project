She represented Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with the song \"Open Your Heart\", tying in eighth place with the Spanish contestant Beth with 81 points. For most of her life she has lived in the northern part of Iceland. In November 1999, Birgitta replaced the then lead vocalist of the pop group Írafár. They released their first single \"Hvar er ég?\" (\"Where am I?\") in the summer of 2000, followed by two more singles in 2001. The band signed a recording contract with Iceland's biggest record company, Skífan in 2002, releasing their first album \"Allt sem ég sé\" (\"All I see\") in early November. It is Iceland's fastest selling pop album of the last 25 years, reaching platinum - which is not common in Iceland. As of 2003[update], Birgitta Haukdal is one of the most popular female pop vocalists in Iceland. She has been voted Pop Star of the Year and Performer of the Year.
