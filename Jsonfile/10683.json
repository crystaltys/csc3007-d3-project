{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Prince Edward Island is part of an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Province of Prince Edward Island has the tenth-most cases of COVID-19 in Canada. Up until January 14, 2022, Prince Edward Island was the only province/territory that did not have any deaths due to COVID-19. On March 14, 2020, the first confirmed case in Prince Edward Island was announced, a woman in her 50s who had returned from a trip on a cruise ship on March 7.[1] By March 26, 2020, there were five cases, all of which had been travel related.[2] As of March 30, 2022, Prince Edward Island has reported 25,800 confirmed cases of the virus and eighteen deaths.[3] Cases remained relatively low throughout the Summer and Fall months. However, in late-December 2021, Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) began to experience a surge in COVID-19 cases, primarily caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Prince Edward Island's caseload quickly accelerated, and the province surpassed 1,000 confirmed cases on December 29, 2021, when health officials reported 129 new cases;[84] a record-breaking, single-day increase in cases. This record was broken again on December 30, 2021, when officials reported 169 new cases,[85] and on December 31, 2021, with 175 new cases.[86]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Prince Edward Island - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10683","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Prince_Edward_Island"}
