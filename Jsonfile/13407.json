{"Content: ":"Mostafa Kamal Madbouly (Arabic: مصطفى كمال مدبولي; born 28 April 1966)[1][2] is the Prime Minister of Egypt, serving since 2018. He was appointed by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to succeed Sherif Ismail following his government's resignation in the wake of Sisi's re-election. Madbouly also served in Sherif Ismail's cabinet as a Minister of Housing and Urban Utilities, and had also briefly served as interim Prime Minister.[3][4] Madbouly graduated from Cairo University,[5] receiving a master's degree and PhD from the Faculty of Engineering in 1988 and 1997, respectively. From September 2009 until November 2011, Madbouly was the chairman of the General Authority for Urban Planning at the Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Development; he also was the executive director of the Training and Urban Studies Institute at the Housing and Construction Research Center at the Ministry of Housing. From November 2012 until February 2014 he was the regional director for Arab countries at the United Nations Human Settlements Program.[6] In March 2014 he was appointed Minister of Housing under Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, a post he continued to hold following the appointment of Sherif Ismail as Prime Minister in September 2015. During his tenure as housing minister, the \u201cmillion housing units\u201d project came to fruition, and was one of the major national projects that came into force after President Sisi took office, though the project was former Housing Minister Mohamed Fathy al-Baradei's idea. For political and social reasons, the project, which was suggested by Baradie in 2011, stopped during the Muslim brotherhood era, and came into force again when Madbouly took office.[7] In November 2017, Madbouly was appointed interim Prime Minister following Sherif Ismail's departure to Germany for medical treatment.[8] On 7 June 2018, President Sisi appointed Madbouly as Prime Minister, succeeding Sherif Ismail who had resigned in the wake of Sisi's re-election in the controversial presidential election.[9] On 9 June, Prime Minister Madbouly reshuffled Egypt's cabinet, replacing eight ministers.[10] It was also reported the same day that the Egyptian Parliament had agreed to his new list of Cabinet Ministers.[11] On 10 June, it was revealed that eight women would serve in his Cabinet, breaking the previous administration's record number of six.[12][13] On 13 June, it was reported that Madbouly had selected 13 to 16 deputy ministers and that Madbouly and his government would be sworn in by Sisi on 14 June.[14] Madbouly and his cabinet were sworn in by Sisi on 14 June.[15] He will also maintain his position as Housing Minister.[16] It was reported that government would issue its policy statement on 23 June,[17][18][19][20] but parliamentary spokesman Salah Hassaballah stated these reports to be incorrect.[21] On 23 June, Hassaballah stated that while no date was now scheduled to present the policy statement before Parliament, he expected the Madbouly government to present it in the next week but that the government was unable to prepare it in time for the planned date.[21] On 30 June it was announced that Madbouly would present its policy statement on 3 July, in order to comply with the Constitutional 20-day deadline upon Cabinet formation.[22] On 3 July 2018, Madbouly officially issued his policy statement to the Egyptian parliament.[23] In the statement, he declared that 85% of his economic reform programme had been accomplished.[23] The statement was then sent to a parliament committee chaired by a House deputy speaker, which will afterwards be followed by a vote of confidence.[22] Article 146 of the constitution stipulates that a newly appointed prime minister must deliver a policy statement before parliament, after which MPs should vote on the policy, in a process that ends within 30 days.[24] On 11 July 2018, First deputy speaker of Egypt's parliament Al-Sayed Al-Sherif, who headed the parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the Madbouly's policy statement, announced that his committee had completed its review of the statement and recommended a vote of confidence in favor for 15 July.[25] On 25 July 2018, ten days after the intended date, the Egyptian parliament approved both Madbouly's cabinet and his policy statement in a vote of confidence.[26][27]","Title":"Mostafa Madbouly - Wikipedia","KeyID":"13407","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Madbouly"}
