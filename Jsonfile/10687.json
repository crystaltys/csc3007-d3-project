The move faced criticism (including from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who urged the Premier to continue being \"transparent and open\" in its data), leading the province to backtrack and continue releasing numbers daily.

This led to a one-time addition of 23,686 recoveries, and the reduction of active cases from 27,603 to 1,556.[145] Premier Legault suggests that the spread of the virus is not linked to bars, but rather to private parties.[146] The Montreal Regional Directorate of Public Health announces that three new COVID-19 walk-in screening clinics are open.[147][148] July 18 \u2014 Masks become mandatory in closed public spaces for everyone over the age of 12.

Police officers \"will be able to obtain warrants faster through a new, virtual system that was established in collaboration with the Crown... Normally the process for obtaining a warrant can take a day or two, but that won't work when police want to break up parties that very same evening,\" said Premier Legault. Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said \"We had to give the police the means to intervene.\" She said that the right to peaceful protest \"without masks cannot be tolerated\" and she is not ruling out using force to disperse protests if needed. \"Eventually, we will cross that bridge when we get there,\" she said.[162] October 1 \u2014 Quebec reverses its earlier objections and announces that it plans to join COVID Alert, with Dubé arguing that it would be quicker to adopt a platform that was already available than to commission one from local developers.[163] October 5 \u2014 Quebec officially joins the COVID Alert app. Premier Legault emphasizes that the more people use the app, \"the more successful we will be and the faster we can go back to a normal way of life.\"[164] The government announces new measures for regions in red zones including the closure of gyms, suspension of team sports, and mandate for high school students to wear masks.

Consequently, holiday celebrations will be restricted to one's own family \"bubble\", defined as those who live at the same address.[171] An exception will be made for single-parent households and people who live alone, who are permitted to join one other family's bubble between December 17 and January 10, 2021.[172] December 10 \u2014 Montreal registers a record 648 new cases of COVID-19.[173] December 13 \u2014 Quebec receives its first shipments of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.[174] December 14 \u2014 The first person in Quebec and Canada gets vaccinated against COVID-19.[175] December 15 \u2014 In the face of the worsening second wave, the Quebec government orders the closure of non-essential stores from December 25 to January 11, 2021, the date on which other restrictions are also meant to be lifted.
