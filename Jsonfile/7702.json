{"Content: ":"An ethnolinguistic group (or ethno-linguistic group) is a group that is unified by both a common ethnicity and language. Most ethnic groups share a first language.[1][2] However, the term is often used to emphasise that language is a major basis for the ethnic group, especially with regards to its neighbours.[1] A central concept in the linguistic study of ethnolinguistic groups is ethnolinguistic vitality, the ability of the group's language and ethnicity to sustain themselves.[3] An ethnolinguistic group that lacks such vitality is unlikely to survive as a distinct entity. Factors that influence the ethnolinguistic vitality are demographics, institutional control and status (including language planning factors).[4]  This sociolinguistics article is a stub.
