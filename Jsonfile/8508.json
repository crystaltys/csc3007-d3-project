{"Content: ":"Paris La Défense Arena (originally known as the U Arena) is a multi-use domed stadium in Nanterre, a western suburb of Paris. Opened in October 2017, it was developed by the rugby union club Racing 92, and replaced Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as their home field. It is one of the two multi-use domed stadiums to be built in Europe, along with Telenor Arena and is Europe\u2019s largest indoor arena.[1] Its naming rights are held by Paris La Défense, the management company of the nearby La Défense business district. The venue offers three separate configurations. In its rugby configuration, it has a nominal seating capacity of 30,681. For concerts, it is able to seat 40,000.[2] Finally, a movable stand allows it to also be used for a variety of indoor sports, at various capacities, with a capacity of as low as 5,000 being possible. The venue also includes 33,000 square metres (360,000 sq ft) of office space, 300 student rooms, shops, including a club shop, a brewery and a gourmet restaurant. It is scheduled to host swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Due to IOC sponsorship regulations, the venue will be referred to as Arena 92.[3] The stadium was originally planned to open in 2014, but that date was delayed, due to local protests.[why?][4][5] It eventually opened in October 2017, although Racing 92 did not play their first home game in the new stadium until they hosted Toulouse on 22 December 2017.[6] The stadium's working name was changed from \"Arena92\" to \"U Arena\"; referencing the configuration of the main stands, and the structure's shape, when viewed from the air, in November 2016.[7] The name was changed a second time to the current Paris La Défense Arena on 12 June 2018.[8] This followed a 10-year naming rights agreement with Paris La Défense, the company that manages the nearby La Défense business district.[9] The venue was originally planned to have a retractable roof, but it was ultimately built with a fixed roof instead. The Rolling Stones were the first band to ever perform a concert in the stadium, closing their Europe-only No Filter Tour, with three shows, on 19, 22, and 25 October 2017.[10] The arena's first rugby union match, took place on 25 November 2017 between France and Japan. On 11 March 2018, the French professional basketball clubs Nanterre 92 and ASVEL Basket, played each other in a LNB Pro A 2017\u201318 season game. The game had an attendance of 15,220, which was the highest attendance of any game in the league's history.[11] Since 2017 it has hosted the Paris Motocross.[12] Media related to Paris La Défense Arena at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"Paris La Défense Arena - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8508","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D%C3%A9fense_Arena"}
