{"Content: ":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Trois-Rivières (Latin: Dioecesis Trifluvianensis in Canada) (erected 8 June 1852) is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Québec. The Diocese of Trois-Rivières was erected from the Archdiocese of Quebec on June 8, 1852. Rev. Thomas Cooke was appointed the first bishop. At that time, the diocese extended to the Eastern Townships, and included thirty-nine parishes.[1] The Collège des Trois-Rivières was founded in 1860; in 1874, it became the diocesan seminary. Also in 1874, the Diocese of Sherbrooke was created from Trois-Rivières. Notre-Dame-du-Cap was designated a national pilgrimage site by the bishops of Canada in 1909.[2] Coordinates: 46°21\u203200\u2033N 72°33\u203200\u2033W﻿ / ﻿46.3500°N 72.5500°W﻿ / 46.3500; -72.5500","Title":"Roman Catholic Diocese of Trois-Rivières - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17919","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res"}
