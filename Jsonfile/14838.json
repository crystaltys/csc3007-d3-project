{"Content: ":"The Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) (Sinhala: දිගු දුර විහිදුම් බලකාය Digu Dura Vihidum Balakaya) (Tamil:ஆழ ஊடுருவித்தாக்கும் படையணி) is a covert operation unit of the Sri Lanka Army. This unit is also known as the Deep Penetration Unit (DPU)[1] and as the Mahasohon Brigade[2] (Mahasohona is a demon, who made unexpected attacks at night, according to Sinhalese folklore hence literally meaning the Brigade who attacked clandestinely and unexpectedly). Colonel Raj Vijayasiri of the Special Forces is credited as the main figure who introduced the DPU concept and the Mahasohon Brigade to the Special Forces.[3] LRRP units carry out the most complex and dangerous military operations of Sri Lanka. In the recent Sri Lankan Civil War, LRRP units have been successful in assassinating several high-level commanders of the LTTE in LTTE-held territory.[1] The unit has also been accused of launching attacks on and killing civilians.[1] The LRRP suffered a setback when a safehouse was raided by the police; they arrested several personnel along with weapons. Before the misunderstanding was later cleared out and the arrested released, the names of the personnel involved in the unit were released to the public media, resulting in the assassination of several of them. The LRRP was later reformed and has resumed its activities following the resumption of hostilities after a ceasefire between the government and the LTTE was canceled. The exact number of troops involved with the LRRP is not known, and neither the Sri Lanka Army nor the Sri Lankan government has officially acknowledged its existence. The unit is operated under the Directorate of Military Intelligence of the Army. It is believed to be composed of personnel from the Commando[4] and Special Forces[2] regiments of the Sri Lanka Army and selected members of Special Boats Squadron of the Sri Lanka Navy.[5] as well as former members of Tamil militant groups. These personnel have received specialized training in Sri Lanka and abroad. Allegations have been made that LRRP units received training from US Special Forces.[6] The LRRP was believed to have been led by captain Shahul Hameed Nilam before the ceasefire, with Major Tuan Nizam Muthaliff acting as a deputy commander. Long-range reconnaissance patrols of the Sri Lanka Army have played a notable role in Sri Lanka's multi-phase military campaign against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). LRRP members attached to Special Mission units of the Sri Lankan Army have been most successful in carrying out assassinations on high-ranking members of the LTTE.[7] The LRRP concept was developed by Major Sreepathi Gunasekara who formed a special recon unit named 'Delta Patrols' in 1986 which later evolved into a highly secretive LRRP battalion. The date of formation of the LRRP remains classified but is believed to have influenced the LTTE to enter the ceasefire agreement with the Government in 2002 to cease LRRP activities. LRRP activities were ceased. The military believed that the targeting of high-profile LTTE leadership by the LRRP was a prominent factor in prompting the LTTE to agree for negotiations.[8] The existence of LRRP was revealed as a result of a raid in 02 January 2002, when a police team led by SP Kulasiri Udugampola raided an LRRP safehouse in Athurugiriya, a suburb close to the capital, Colombo under the belief of an assassination plot on the leaders of the recently elected United National Party government. Six personnel were arrested, including Captain Nilam, the leader of the unit. Four soldiers and a former LTTE cadre were also arrested. In addition, a number of weapons were taken into custody, including explosives, anti-tank and thermobaric weapons. Details of this raid and the weapons were made public through media. Attempts by the military hierarchy to get the arrested personnel released failed, and Army commander Lt. Gen. Lionel Balagalla issued a public statement revealing the true nature of this unit. The arrested personnel were released only after interrogation on 13 January, under orders from Defence Minister Tilak Marapana, who expressed outrage over the police raid.[9] Soon after the incident, LTTE began a campaign to eliminate the members of the LRRP and those who were suspected of assisting them.[10] A key informant of the unit, known as Mike, was abducted and killed by the LTTE on 20 January. More than 80 persons involved with the LRRP were assassinated after this. The newly elected government did not take any significant measures to stop it, and requests made by the state intelligence agencies were ignored on the basis that it will affect the ceasefire.[10] The Army Commander, under the direction of the Defence Minister, appointed a Court of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the LRRP. The conclusion of the court of inquiry was that their activities were legitimate and all military hardware found were obtained through legitimate means. As the public controversy on this incident and the killings continued, President Chandrika Kumaratunga appointed a Commission of Inquiry to probe the safehouse raid. The Commission\u2019s conclusion was that in addition to compromising national security interests, the raid was a \"total betrayal and absolute treachery to the nation\". The report included a list of officers of the police and army responsible for the incident.[10] A special team was set up by the Chief of Police to investigate into the actions of Udugampola and several other police officers. After the ceasefire was canceled and hostilities resumed in 2006, LRRP was reformed and actively participating in the operations against the LTTE.[2] The LRRP has launched several attacks against LTTE leaders. Head of the LTTE military intelligence, Col. Charles, was killed in one such attack. Cheliyan, the deputy leader of the Sea Tigers, was also killed in an LRRP attack.[11] The LTTE accused the LRRP of targeting civilians in areas under their control but military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara denied any involvement in these incidents, stating that the LRRP only targets armed LTTE cadres.[12] In June 2008, The LTTE accused LRRP units of killing 26 civilians in three attacks alleged attacks and have also blamed LRRP for targeting a bus carrying school children, and the killing of Tamil National Alliance member K. Sivanesan.[1] It was also accused of assassinating Father M. X. Karunaratnam, the chairman of the Pro-LTTE North East Secretariat on Human Rights (NESOHR).[13] [14] LRRP units have been successful in carrying out several attacks behind enemy lines. Operations use small groups, who go into and out of enemy territory clandestinely through jungle routes and seek their targets. These groups may stay in safehouses or camp in the jungles until they are ready to take their designated target. Many of the attacks launched by LRRP units targeted high-profile LTTE commanders and were carried out in the manner of roadside ambushes.[1] Before the 2002 ceasefire agreement was signed, the government denied allegations from the LTTE that state-backed deep-penetration units were targeting their leaders. Shankar, head of the LTTE air wing, was killed in such an attack on 6 September 2001. Although his death was speculated to be a result of an internal struggle within the LTTE, the LTTE accused Army LRRP units of launching the attack that killed him.[8][15] A senior sea tiger commander, Gangai Amaran, was another high-profile LTTE leader killed by the LRRP.[16] Other LTTE commanders killed in LRRP attacks include Batticaloa District Intelligence Head Lt. Col. Nizam,[16] LTTE Batticaloa-Ampara Communications Chief Major Mano and artillery specialist Major Sathiyaseelan.[1] Former head of the LTTE political wing, S. P. Tamilselvan\u2019s vehicle was attacked by LRRP units in May 2001. Tamilselvan was not in the vehicle at the time.[4] LRRP units have also made failed assassination attempts on several other LTTE leaders including Col. Karuna, Col. Jeyam and Brig. Balraj.[1][16] The LTTE has accused the LRRP of attempting to carry out attacks even against the LTTE leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran.[17] List of Top LTTE commanders killed by LRRP","Title":"Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (Sri Lanka) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14838","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Reconnaissance_Patrol_(Sri_Lanka)"}
