{"Content: ":"Yasmin \"Jessie\" Duarte (born Yasmin Dangor; 19 September 1953 \u2013 17 July 2022) was a South African politician and acting secretary-general of the African National Congress. A longtime anti-apartheid activist, she served variously as a special assistant to Nelson Mandela, a member of the provincial cabinet (MEC) for Gauteng, as ambassador to Mozambique, and as spokesperson for the ANC, before assuming her post as Deputy Secretary-General of the ANC in 2012, until her death on 17 July 2022. After matriculation from Coronationville Secondary School in Johannesburg, Duarte started her professional career as a Management Accountant. By 1979, she was recruited by Albertina Sisulu to set up women\u2019s structures throughout South Africa.[1][2] Two years later, in 1981, she served in the position of secretary of the Federation of Transvaal Women (FEDTRAW).[3] In 1988, she was detained without trial. She was placed under restriction orders until the lifting of the state of emergency.[1] Around that time she was working with Reverend Beyers Naud√© to set up a scholarship fund to educate anti-apartheid activists to become an effective corps of public servants.[1][2] When Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, he appointed Duarte to be one of his personal assistants, a position she held until he became president in 1994.[4] She also assisted Walter Sisulu in a similar capacity in the lead-up to South Africa's first democratic elections.[5][6] She became involved in ANC leadership at a regional level, and was elected to the Transvaal Provincial Executive Council (PEC), appointed to the ANC's Interim Leadership Core,[1] and became the inaugural Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Safety and Security in Gauteng.[4][5] And in 1997, she was elected to ANC's national executive committee.[6] In 1998, she was accused of taking her lover on a trip to Portugal at the taxpayers' expense, sparking a controversy on the possible misuse of public funds.[7] She was subsequently forced to quit her position as Safety and Security MEC after a commission of inquiry reported a \"strong suspicion\" that she had covered up a car accident while driving without a licence.[8] Jessie Duarte admitted to having driven a car without a license but maintained that it was people in her department who had put out the claim that it was a bodyguard driving at the time.[9] The Mail & Guardian newspaper reported that she delivered the allegedly fraudulent document containing this claim to them in person.[10] Duarte then became a diplomat and served as the South African ambassador to Mozambique from 1999 to 2003.[5] In 2009 she featured in the news for two recorded diatribes launched against journalists Philani Nombembe of the Sunday Times[11] and John Humphrys of BBC Radio.[12] She later voiced support for the ANC's plans for a Media Appeals Tribunal in South Africa[13] that faced criticism as being political interference with free speech and possibly unconstitutional.[14] Jessie Duarte blamed the media for portraying Jacob Zuma in a negative light[15] and her dislike for the media was an open secret.[16] In December 2012, she was elected as Deputy Secretary-General of the African National Congress during the 53rd National Conference held in Mangaung.[17] She was re-elected for a second five-year term at ANC's following national conference in Nasrec in 2017.[18] She took over as ANC's interim Secretary-General when the incumbent Ace Magashule was placed on temporary suspension due to his indictment for corruption in May 2021.[19][20] In 2014, Duarte publicly compared Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to that of Nazi Germany.[21] This drew strong rebukes from Jewish groups within South Africa.[22] In 2019, she accused the ANC, the majority ruling party in South Africa, of being \"racist\" and \"tribalistic\" towards members and voters who are not black Africans.[23] On 7 January 2021, Duarte announced that she would be retiring as deputy secretary-general of the ANC at the party's next conference in 2022.[24] She was accused of being tolerant of corruption within government structures,[25] and in April 2021 supported Jacob Zuma's claims that the commission set up to investigate state capture under his rule was discredited.[26] Evidence given at the commission suggested that Jessie Duarte\u2019s ex-husband John Duarte was one of the people who appeared in the evidence of money flows from contracts within the scope of the commission's investigation.[27] Her son was also accused of receiving money from a company that was awarded government tenders.[28] In June 2021, months after a report implicating the Chinese government in using the Uyghur minority for forced labour inside sweat shops in northwest China,[29] Jessie Duarte was quoted by China's state news service, Xinhua News Agency, as saying that China is an example for many developing countries to learn from in areas such as poverty eradication as well as economic growth and development in east China; Duarte believed that the approach upheld by the CPC resonates with the ANC, which honors the belief of Batho-Pele, or \"People First.\"[30][31]. Duarte was born as Yasmin Dangor, one of nine children of Julie and Ebrahim Dangor, on 19 September 1953,[1][2][4] in Coronationville on Johannesburg's west rand, and grew up in nearby Westbury and Newclare.[32] She was the sister of the poet and activist Achmat Dangor.[33] She was married to John Duarte, with whom she had two children, and divorced in 2001.[34] In 2022, the African National Congress gave Jessie Duarte sick leave and she was away from her political duties for many months. After false claims of her death circulated on social media in the wake of her absence from public party events, Duarte revealed on 24 April 2022 that she had cancer.[35] She eventually died from cancer on 17 July 2022 at age 68.[2][5][4][36][37] Her funeral was held in accordance with Muslim rites later that same day, with the eulogy delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa; she was then buried at Westpark Cemetery.[38][39]","Title":"Jessie Duarte - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17256","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Duarte"}
