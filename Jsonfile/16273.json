The oblast's administrative centre is Luhansk; however, its Regional State Administration has been temporarily relocated to Sievierodonetsk because of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War,[1] which was itself captured on 25 June 2022 after a long battle by Russian and pro-Russian forces.[2][3][4] ","Title":"Russian occupation of Luhansk Oblast - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16273","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_occupation_of_Luhansk_Oblast"}
