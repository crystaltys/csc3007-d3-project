{"Content: ":"Luhansk Oblast (Ukrainian: Луга́нська о́бласть, romanized: Luhanska oblast; also referred to as Luhanshchyna, Ukrainian: Луга́нщина) is the de jure easternmost oblast (province) of Ukraine. Since 3 July 2022, the entire oblast has been under the occupation of Russia and its separatist puppet state, the Luhansk People's Republic, which claims the oblast as its territory. The oblast's administrative center was Luhansk. The oblast was established in 1938 and bore the name Voroshilovgrad Oblast (Ukrainian: Ворошиловградська область, romanized: Voroshylovhradska oblast, until 1958 and again from 1970 to 1991[9]) in honor of Kliment Voroshilov. Its population is estimated as 2,121,322 (2021 est.)[8] Important cities within the oblast include Alchevsk, Antratsyt, Brianka, Kirovsk, Krasnyi Luch, Krasnodon, Lysychansk, Luhansk, Pervomaisk, Rovenky, Rubizhne, Sverdlovsk, Sievierodonetsk, and Stakhanov. The war in Donbas and the subsequent 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine saw heavy fighting in the oblast, with Sievierodonetsk captured in June by Russian and LPR forces[10] after an assault lasting several weeks,[11][12] and the oblast's last major settlement under Ukrainian control, Lysychansk, captured by Russian and Russia-backed forces on 2 July.[13] The next day, Russia's Minister of Defence announced that the entire territory of the oblast had been \"liberated\",[14] but three weeks later the governor of the oblast reported heavy fighting was still ongoing.[15] Luhansk Oblast is located in eastern Ukraine. The area of the oblast (26,700 km2), comprises about 4.42% of the total area of Ukraine. Its length from north to south is 250 km. Its width from east to west is 190 km. The oblast has the longest segment of the Ukrainian international border with Russia among other regions (see State Border of Ukraine) consisting of 746 km (464 mi). The abutting Russian oblasts are Belgorod Oblast to the north, Voronezh Oblast to the northeast, Rostov Oblast to the east. Abutting Ukrainian oblasts are Kharkiv Oblast to the west, and Donetsk Oblast to the south. The region is located in the valley of the Siversky Donets river, which splits the region approximately in half. The southern portion of the region is elevated by the Donetsk Ridge which is located closer to the southern border. The highest point is Mohyla Mechetna (367 m (1,204 ft)) which is the highest point of Donetsk Ridge. The left bank of the Siversky Donets river is part of the Starobilsk Plain. To the north this transforms into the Central Russian Upland. Belgorod Oblast, Russia Voronezh Oblast, Russia Rostov Oblast, Russia Donetsk Oblast Kharkiv Oblast The oblast originated in 1938 as Voroshylovhrad (Russian: Voroshilovgrad) Oblast after the Donetsk Oblast was split between Voroshylovhrad and Stalino (today Donetsk Oblast) oblasts. After the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1941 the region came under a German military administration, due to its proximity to frontlines. It was occupied at the end of 1942 as part of Case Blue German offensive directed towards Stalingrad. Soon after the battle of Stalingrad, the Luhansk region (at that time Voroshilovgrad) again became center of military operations during the Soviet counter-offensive operation Little Saturn in the spring of 1943. In the summer of 1943 the region was liberated from the Nazi Germany Armed Forces. During the Soviet era the Oblast bore its current name between 1958 and 1970. During the fateful March Referendum of 1991, 70.16% of all Ukrainians voted to remain a part of the Soviet Union as a sovereign republic, while only 27.99% voted 'no'.[16] In the December 1991 referendum (after the August coup ended all hope of a restored Union), 83.86% of votes in the oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. In 1994 a referendum took place in the Donetsk Oblast and the Luhansk Oblast, with around 90% supporting the Russian language becoming an official language alongside Ukrainian, and for Russian to be an official language on a regional level. The referendum was annulled by the Kyiv government.[17][18] On 8 April 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia, pro-Russian separatists occupying the Luhansk Oblast administrative building planned to declare the independence of the region as the Luhansk Parliamentary Republic,[clarification needed] after other pro-Russian separatists declared Donetsk People's Republic in the Donetsk Oblast (7 April 2014). When the Luhansk Parliamentary Republic ceased to exist, the separatists declared the Luhansk People's Republic on 27 April 2014. They held a disputed referendum on separating from Ukraine on 11 May 2014. The legitimacy of the referendums was not recognized by any government.[19] Ukraine does not recognize the referendum, while the EU and US said the polls were illegal.[20] Subsequently, the war in Donbas started. As a result of the war in Donbas, Luhansk insurgents control the southern third of the oblast, which includes the city of Luhansk, the region's most populous city and the capital of the oblast. Due to this, most oblast government functions have moved to Sievierodonetsk, which forces of the Government of Ukraine recaptured in July 2014. Many universities located in the occupied areas have moved to government-controlled cities such as Sievierodonetsk, Starobilsk or Rubizhne.[21][22] A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 5.7% of the oblast's population supported their region joining Russia, 84.1% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond. Insurgent-controlled areas were not polled.[23] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian ground forces entered occupied territory of Luhansk Oblast by crossing the Russian border on February 22, 2022, and invaded government-controlled territory across the line of contact and the Russian border on February 24. As of 26 May 2022 had occupied all but 5% of the region.[24] On 4-5 July 2022 during international Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2022) in Lugano Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and Czechia pledged to support the rebuilding of Luhansk region.[25] Like the rest of the provinces in Ukraine, Luhansk Oblast has a double jurisdiction. The oblast is predominantly administrated by the Luhansk Oblast State Administration, headed by the governor of the oblast, who is appointed by the President of Ukraine. The province has a representative body, the provincial council, which is headed by its chairman and elected by popular vote. The province is primarily divided into 18 raions (districts), and 37 cities, including 14 cities of regional significance. The administrative center is Luhansk. These raions are listed below with their areas and populations.[26] The province's secondary division consists of various municipalities. Those municipalities may consist of one or more populated places. The municipalities are administratively subordinate to the raion in which they are located, with the exception of 14 cities subordinated directly to the oblast. The city of Luhansk is subdivided into its own four city-districts (boroughs). All subdivisions are governed by their respective councils (radas). The population is largely Russian-speaking, although ethnic Ukrainians constitute a majority (58.0%). Among the minorities are native Russians (39.1%), Belarusians (0.8%), and others (1.4%). Ukrainians constitute the majority in all raions except for Stanytsia-Luhanska Raion and Krasnodon Raion, both of which are east of Luhansk. Ethnic Russians also constitute the majority in regionally significant cities, such as Krasnodon, Sverdlovsk, Krasnyi Luch and Stakhanov. In the 2001 Ukrainian Census, more than 68.8% of the population considered themselves Russian speakers, while 30.0% considered themselves Ukrainian speakers. The Russophone population predominates in the southern portion of the region and around the city of Luhansk, while the northern region is less populated, mostly agricultural and Ukrainophone. Its population (as of 2004) of 2,461,506 constitutes 5.13% of the overall Ukrainian population. The Luhansk Oblast rates fifth in Ukraine by the number of its inhabitants, having an average population density of 90.28/km2. About 87% of the population lives in urban areas, while the remaining 13% reside in agricultural areas. According to the national census, 54% of the population are Ukrainians and 42% are Russians. Economically the region is connected with the Donets Basin. The oblast has post industrial sites which run off building material into surrounding land. Yakymchuk 2018 finds feral stands of Triticum aestivum have colonised several of these sites.[27] Through the region pass two major European routes E50 and E40. There are 24 Russo-Ukrainian international border checkpoints of various entry. Rail transportation is administered by the Donetsk Railway. There is also its regional airport Luhansk International Airport with its own carrier. The following sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.","Title":"Luhansk Oblast - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15551","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_Oblast"}
