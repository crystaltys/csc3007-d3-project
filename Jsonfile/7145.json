{"Content: ":"This list includes those who have acted as presenters of the Eurovision Song Contest, since the competition's inception in 1956. From 1988, it has been the norm to have two presenters for the contest. All contests before 1978 have had one presenter, and only a few after 1988 have had only one presenter (these being in 1993, 1995 and 2013). The 1999 contest was the first to consist of three presenters in one contest, and this method has been used most often since 2010. The contests from 2018 to 2021 consisted of four presenters each (excluding the cancelled 2020 contest). Songs of Europe was a concert television programme from Mysen, Norway to commemorate the contest's twenty-fifth anniversary. The event featured nearly all the winners of the contest from 1956 to 1981. Kvalifikacija za Millstreet (English: Qualification for Millstreet; French: Qualification pour Millstreet) was the preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. Seven countries took part; Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest was a special TV show broadcast from Copenhagen, Denmark to mark the Eurovision Song Contest's fiftieth anniversary and to determine the Contest's most popular entrant of its fifty years. The event was hosted by two former participants: Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits (also known as Eurovision's Greatest Hits) was a live television concert programme organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to commemorate the Eurovision Song Contest's 60th anniversary. Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light was a live television programme organised by the EBU and produced by NPO, NOS and AVROTROS as a replacement for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 after its cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to each year's contest, a series of draws have been held to determine differing facets of the contest's production, which typically are presided by one or more presenters. Historically a random drawing of lots was held prior to each year's contest to determine the order in which participating countries would perform in the grand final, and since 2004 in the semi-finals; this was abolished in 2013, when the running order began to be determined by the contest producers.[91] A semi-final allocation draw has been held since 2008, to determine which countries perform in which of the two semi-finals, as well as in which semi-final the automatic finalists have voting rights. The semi-finalist countries are divided into pots based on historic voting patterns, and countries in each pot are then split equally between the two semi-finals.[92] During this draw the countries are also assigned to perform in either the first or second half of the show; the exact running order is then determined at a later date.[93]","Title":"List of Eurovision Song Contest presenters - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7145","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eurovision_Song_Contest_presenters"}
