{"Content: ":"Edward V (2 November 1470 \u2013 c. mid-1483)[1][2] was de jure King of England and Lord of Ireland from 9 April to 25 June 1483. He succeeded his father, Edward IV, upon the latter's death. Edward V was never crowned, and his brief reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle and Lord Protector, the Duke of Gloucester, who deposed him to reign as King Richard III; this was confirmed by the Act entitled Titulus Regius, which denounced any further claims through his father's heirs. Edward V and his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, were the Princes in the Tower who disappeared after being sent to heavily guarded royal lodgings in the Tower of London. Responsibility for their deaths is widely attributed to Richard III, but the lack of solid evidence and conflicting contemporary accounts allow for other possibilities. Edward was born on 2 November 1470 at Cheyneygates, the medieval house of the Abbot of Westminster, adjoining Westminster Abbey. His mother, Elizabeth Woodville, had sought sanctuary there from Lancastrian supporters who had deposed his father, the Yorkist king Edward IV, during the course of the Wars of the Roses. Edward was created Prince of Wales in June 1471,[1] following his father's restoration to the throne, and in 1473 was established at Ludlow Castle on the Welsh Marches as nominal president of a newly created Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1479, his father conferred the earldom of Pembroke on him; it became merged into the crown on his succession.[3] Prince Edward was placed under the supervision of the queen's brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, a noted scholar. In a letter to Rivers, Edward IV set down precise conditions for the upbringing of his son and the management of the prince's household.[4] He was to \"arise every morning at a convenient hour, according to his age\". His day would begin with matins and then Mass, which he was to receive uninterrupted. After breakfast, the business of educating the prince began with \"virtuous learning\". Dinner was served from ten in the morning, and then he was to be read \"noble stories ... of virtue, honour, cunning, wisdom, and of deeds of worship\" but \"of nothing that should move or stir him to vice\". Perhaps aware of his own vices, the king was keen to safeguard his son's morals, and instructed Rivers to ensure that no one in the prince's household was a habitual \"swearer, brawler, backbiter, common hazarder, adulterer, [or user of] words of ribaldry\". After further study, in the afternoon the prince was to engage in sporting activities suitable for his class, before evensong. Supper was served from four, and curtains were to be drawn at eight. Following this, the prince's attendants were to \"enforce themselves to make him merry and joyous towards his bed\". They would then watch over him as he slept. Dominic Mancini reported of the young Edward V: In word and deed he gave so many proofs of his liberal education, of polite nay rather scholarly, attainments far beyond his age; ... his special knowledge of literature ... enabled him to discourse elegantly, to understand fully, and to declaim most excellently from any work whether in verse or prose that came into his hands, unless it were from the more abstruse authors. He had such dignity in his whole person, and in his face such charm, that however much they might gaze, he never wearied the eyes of beholders.[5] As with several of his other children, Edward IV planned a prestigious European marriage for his eldest son, and in 1480 concluded an alliance with Francis II, Duke of Brittany, whereby Prince Edward was betrothed to the duke's four-year-old heir, Anne. The two were to be married upon their majority, with their eldest son inheriting England and the second son Brittany. Anne later married Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. It was at Ludlow that the 12-year-old prince received news, on Monday 14 April 1483, of his father's sudden death five days before. Edward IV's will, which has not survived, nominated his trusted brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as Protector during the minority of his son. The new king left Ludlow on 24 April, with Richard leaving York a day earlier, planning to meet at Northampton and travel to London together. However, when Richard reached Northampton, Edward and his party had already travelled onward to Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire.[7] The Earl Rivers travelled back to Northampton to meet Richard and Buckingham who had now arrived. On the night of 29 April Richard dined with Rivers and Edward's half-brother, Richard Grey, but the following morning Rivers, Grey and the king's chamberlain, Thomas Vaughan, were arrested and sent north.[8] Despite Richard's assurances all three were subsequently executed. Dominic Mancini, an Italian who visited England in the 1480s, reports that Edward protested, but the remainder of his entourage was dismissed and Richard escorted him to London. On 19 May 1483, the new king took up residence in the Tower of London, where, on 16 June, he was joined by his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York.[9] The council had originally hoped for an immediate coronation to avoid the need for a protectorate. This had previously happened with Richard II, who had become king at the age of ten. Another precedent was Henry VI whose protectorate (which started when he inherited the crown aged 9 months) had ended with his coronation aged seven. Richard, however, repeatedly postponed the coronation.[10] On 22 June, Ralph Shaa preached a sermon declaring that Edward IV had already been contracted to marry Lady Eleanor Butler when he married Elizabeth Woodville, thereby rendering his marriage to Elizabeth invalid and their children together illegitimate.[10] The children of Richard's older brother George, Duke of Clarence, were barred from the throne by their father's attainder, and therefore, on 25 June, an assembly of Lords and Commons declared Richard to be the legitimate king (this was later confirmed by the act of parliament Titulus Regius). The following day he acceded to the throne as King Richard III. Dominic Mancini recorded that after Richard III seized the throne, Edward and his brother Richard were taken into the \"inner apartments of the Tower\" and then were seen less and less until the end of the summer to the autumn of 1483, when they disappeared from public view altogether. During this period Mancini records that Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, \"like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him.\"[11] The Latin reference to Argentinus medicus had previously been translated as \"a doctor from Strasbourg\", because the Latin name for the city of Strasbourg, Argentoratum, was still current at the time; however, D. E. Rhodes suggests it may actually refer to \"Doctor Argentine\", whom Rhodes identifies as John Argentine, an English physician who would later serve as provost of King's College, Cambridge, and as doctor to Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King Henry VII of England (Henry Tudor).[9] The princes' fate after their disappearance remains unknown, but the most widely accepted theory is that they were murdered on the orders of their uncle, King Richard.[12] Thomas More wrote that they were smothered to death with their pillows, and his account forms the basis of William Shakespeare's play Richard III, in which Tyrrell murders the princes on Richard's orders. In the absence of hard evidence a number of other theories have been put forward, of which the most widely discussed are that they were murdered on the orders of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, or by Henry Tudor. However, A. J. Pollard points out that these theories are less plausible than the straightforward one that they were murdered by their uncle[13] who in any case controlled access to them and was therefore regarded as responsible for their welfare.[14] In the period before the boys' disappearance, Edward was regularly being visited by a doctor; historian David Baldwin extrapolates that contemporaries may have believed Edward had died of an illness (or as the result of attempts to cure him).[15] An alternative theory is that Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the throne, was indeed Richard, Duke of York, as he claimed, having escaped to Flanders after his uncle's defeat at Bosworth to be raised by his aunt, Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy. Bones belonging to two children were discovered in 1674 by workmen rebuilding a stairway in the Tower. On the orders of King Charles II, these were subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey, in an urn bearing the names of Edward and Richard.[16] The bones were re-examined in 1933, at which time it was discovered the skeletons were incomplete and had been interred with animal bones. It has never been proven that the bones belonged to the princes, and it is possible that they were buried before the reconstruction of that part of the Tower of London.[17] Permission for a subsequent examination has been refused. In 1789, workmen carrying out repairs in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, rediscovered and accidentally broke into the vault of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. Adjoining this was another vault, which was found to contain the coffins of two children. This tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV's children who had predeceased him: George, Duke of Bedford, and Mary. However, the remains of these two children were later found elsewhere in the chapel, leaving the occupants of the children's coffins within the tomb unknown.[18] In 1486 Edward IV's daughter Elizabeth, sister of Edward V, married Henry VII, thereby uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster. As outlined above, on the orders of Charles II, the presumed bones of Edward V and his brother Richard were interred in Westminster Abbey; Edward was thus buried in the place of his birth. The white marble sarcophagus was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and made by Joshua Marshall. The sarcophagus can be found in the north aisle of the Henry VII Chapel, near Elizabeth I's tomb. The Latin inscription on the urn can be translated as follows: Here lie the relics of Edward V, King of England, and Richard, Duke of York. These brothers being confined in the Tower of London, and there stifled with pillows, were privately and meanly buried, by the order of their perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper; their bones, long enquired after and wished for, after 191 years in the rubbish of the stairs (those lately leading to the Chapel of the White Tower) were on the 17th day of July AD 1674 by undoubted proofs discovered, being buried deep in that place. Charles II, a most compassionate king, pitying their severe fate, ordered these unhappy princes to be laid amongst the monuments of their predecessors, AD 1678, in the 30th year of his reign.[19] The original Latin text is as follows (original all in capitals):[20] H.SS Reliquiæ Edwardi Vti Regis Angliæ et Richardi Ducis Eboracensis Hos, fratres germanos, Turre Londinˢ\u2071 conclusos iniectisq culcitris suffocatos, abdite et inhoneste tumulari iussit patruus Richardus Perfidus Regni prædo ossa desideratorum, div et multum quæsita, post annos CXC&1~ scalarum in ruderibus (scala istæ ad Sacellum Turris Albæ nuper ducebant) alte defossa, indictis certissimis sunt reperta XVII die iulii Aº D\u207f\u2071 MDCLXXIIII Carolus II Rex clementissimu sacerbam sortem miseratus inter avita monumena principibus infelicissimis. iusta persolvit. anno dom\u2071 1678 annoq regni sui 30 Edward appears as a character in the play Richard III by William Shakespeare. Edward appears alive in only one scene of the play (Act 3 Scene 1), during which he and his brother are portrayed as bright, precocious children who see through their uncle's ambitions. Edward in particular is portrayed as wiser than his years (something his uncle notes) and ambitious about his kingship. Edward and his brother's deaths are described in the play, but occur offstage. Their ghosts return in one more scene (Act 5 Scene 3) to haunt their uncle's dreams and promise success to his rival, Richmond (i.e. King Henry VII). In film and television adaptations of this play, Edward V has been portrayed by the following actors: Edward V is also featured as a mute role in another of Shakespeare's plays, Henry VI, Part 3, where he appears as a newborn baby in the final scene. His father Edward IV addresses his own brothers thus: \"Clarence, and Gloster, love my lovely queen, And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.\" Gloster, the future Richard III, is at the close of this play already encompassing his nephew's demise, as he mutters in an aside, \"To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master, And cried \u2013 All hail! when as he meant \u2013 all harm.\"[22] Edward appears in The White Queen, a 2009 historical novel by Philippa Gregory and in the subsequent 2013 TV miniseries The White Queen; in the latter he is played by Sonny Ashbourne Serkis.[23][24] As heir apparent, Edward bore the royal arms (quarterly France and England) differenced by a label of three points argent. During his brief reign he used the royal arms undifferenced, supported by a lion and a hart as had his father.[25] His livery badges were the traditional Yorkist symbols of the fetterlocked falcon and the rose argent.[26] Coat of arms as heir apparent (1471\u20131483) Coat of arms as King Edward V (1483) Falcon and fetterlock White rose of York John Evans appears in the historical record when he arrives in Coldridge and is granted the titles of Lord of the Manor and Parker of the deer park behind St Matthew\u2019s church. Even then, he simply appears in history in this role. There\u2019s no record of the grants being made and no mention of a John Evans before this point. The theory goes that John Evans was the fabricated alias for Edward V hence why there\u2019s no record of him before his sudden appearance in Devon. When Edward V became king, at least nominally, his uncle Richard moved to secure the boy and the regency. Part of this involved arresting relatives of Edward\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Woodville, forcing her to claim sanctuary in Westminster Abbey with her daughters for their protection. In March 1484, Richard III having already executed Woodville\u2019s brother and son, promised publicly that he wouldn\u2019t harm her daughters and they wouldn\u2019t face arrest or imprisonment. With this promise secured, Woodville and her daughters left the abbey and were apparently reconciled to Richard. (Their involvement in Henry Tudor\u2019s coup notwithstanding). Proponents of the John Evans was Edward V theory suggest that Woodville negotiated with Richard, and later Henry VII, to allow Edward to leave the tower and live quietly in Devon on lands belonging to her other son, Thomas Grey. In 1511, two years into the reign of Henry VIII, John Evans began work building a chantry within St Matthew\u2019s church in preparation for his eventual internment there and it\u2019s upon his tomb that we apparently find the first indications of his supposed identity. Rather than John Evans, we see \u2018Joh Evas\u2019 and while the \u2018n\u2019 from John has clearly been removed by either vandals or time, there is no such space left in \u2018Evans\u2019. \u2018Evas\u2019 is therefore deliberate and potentially a reference to EV (Edward V) AS (in sanctuary). Just beneath it, we see that someone (presumably not John) has carved the word King (though it appears upside down compared to the name on the tomb), which speaks for itself as a clue. The effigy\u2019s face is also tilted somewhat so instead of looking straight up, it instead gazes at the stained glass window opposite. The subject of which is [drum roll] Edward V. Regardless of whether we accept that John Evans was Edward V or not, we can appreciate that it is kind of weird to find an image of Edward V in a rural Devonshire church. There are a grand total of three depictions of Edward in stained glass. One in Canterbury cathedral, one in Little Malvern Priory (a former Benedictine Abbey), and this one in a small, parish church in Coldridge. The presence of the window is unusual enough but theorists take it further. The ermine adorning the crown is decorated with forty-one deer which links Edward V who would have been forty-one at the time the chantry and window were commissioned, with John Evans who oversaw the deer park nearby. The same window also contains a small depiction of Evans himself. Evans is shown carrying a crown and wearing an ermine robe, both of which were reserved quite specifically for royalty. His chin also bears a scar visible on the depiction of Edward V, also present on the tomb\u2019s effigy which itself bears a striking resemblance to the missing king. All of this is complemented by an absolute myriad of Yorkist imagery. Another window shows the \u2018sunne in splendor\u2019 an emblem of York associated with Edward IV. The same \u2018sunne\u2019 is carved into numerous tiles around the church, and floor tiles display the white rose of York. If John Evans was Edward V, there are at least ways it can be proven or disproven through the same DNA testing that identified the remains of Richard III. Unfortunately, the tomb itself is empty, however there is good reason to assume that Evans lies elsewhere in the church, possibly under the floor tiles. Of course, there\u2019s always the outside chance that the royal family will consent to testing on the remains kept in Westminster Abbey that bear the name of the missing princes and tell us whether there\u2019s a mystery to solve at all.
