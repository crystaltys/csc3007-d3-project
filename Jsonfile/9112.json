This paved the way for the resurgence of dual relations between Turkey and these countries. Sharing a common language, history, culture and ethnicity with these countries, developing these relations has been a permanent focus for Turkey. There was a need to establish an organization in order to fund, develop and coordinate activities and projects in a variety of different fields. The Turkish Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) in 1992 was established for this purpose. TIKA Programme Coordination offices were set up in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Numerous projects in the fields of education, agriculture, industry and finance were undertaken. The main focus in these early years was on educational and social projects in Central Asia such as the construction of schools, universities, libraries and providing scholarships to students and public officials to study in Turkey.[6] In this era, TIKA was developed to become an integral part of Turkish Foreign Policy.[5] Its activity area was enlarged to encompass the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. The number of programme coordination offices more than doubled from 12 offices in 2002 to 28 in 2010.[6] Focus began to shift from direct aid provision to technical assistance, institutional capacity building and human development activities. More than 100 projects were implemented in 25 countries in 2010.[7] By the end of the decade, the destination of the majority of aid and assistance had shifted from Turkic countries to Africa.[7] During this decade, development aid provided by Turkey reached US$1.273 billion.[6] During this period, activities have been expanded into Latin America as well as the wider Asian region.
