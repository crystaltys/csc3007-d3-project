It holds a score of 76/100 on review aggregator Metacritic.[7] Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter praised Bust Down: \"the series\u2019 comic voice is admirably bold \u2014 and if you\u2019re left cold by one joke, there are usually three more coming right on its tail.\"[1] Ebony's Savannah Taylor described the show: \"abandoning the appeal of respectability politics and good-mannered humor, this show...is the definition of doing hood rat stuff with your friends\" and praised the comedy as \"just straight up, raw Black tomfoolery.\"[2] Richard Roeper rated the series 3/4 stars and hailed the \"biting social commentary, some ridiculously effective over-the-top physical shtick and a steady stream of laugh-out-loud moments\" but also noted that the show \"\u201cwill have some viewers bailing within the first 10 minutes of the premiere episode.\"[8] Nina Metz gave Bust Down 3/4 stars in the Chicago Tribune and called the creators and stars \"goofy as hell, but also intelligent and thoughtful and self-aware, which allows them to take on otherwise touchy subject matter.\"[3]","Title":"Bust Down - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17359","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_Down"}
