The area is 197.10 km2 which gives a population density of 50 inhabitants per km2. It is the source of the Oise River. In the administrative district of Thuin, the municipality was created with a merger of 14 communes in 1977. The Trappist monastery of Scourmont Abbey in the town is famous for the Chimay Brewery. The etymology of the name is ultimately, via Vulgar Latin, from the Proto-Celtic word koimos meaning \"pretty, pleasant\". The Walloon names of the place names are in brackets and italics. Chimay has traditionally hosted an annual motor racing event, run on a street circuit formed from local public roads. From the 1920s to 1960s the event was run for contemporary Grand Prix and sportscar categories, and included the famous Grand Prix des Frontières. In recent times, while the event has persisted it has been run for historic race series. The track briefly lost its licence in 2006 related to safety fears, but has since had it reinstated.
