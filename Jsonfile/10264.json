{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Burundi is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Burundi on 25 March 2020.[3] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[4][5] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[6][7] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[8][6] Model-based simulations for Burundi indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t exceeded 1 during the first half of 2021 but diminished to around 0.7 during the second half of 2021.[9]  Through most of 2021, Burundi was one of three countries which refused to have vaccines. In February 2021, Thaddee Ndikumana, the health minister of Burundi, said his country was more concerned with prevention measures. \"Since more than 95% of patients are recovering, we estimate that the vaccines are not yet necessary,\" local media reported.[45] In October 2021, however, the Burundian government announced that it had received delivery of 500,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm BIBP vaccine.[46] A targeted vaccination programme commenced on 18 October 2021. On 12 March, the government instituted 14-day quarantining for people entering Burundi from affected countries.[47][48] President Nkurunziza refused to impose restrictions on the country, permitting political rallies and sporting events to take place.[17]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Burundi - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10264","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Burundi"}
