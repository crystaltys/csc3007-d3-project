{"Content: ":"Alexis Vuillermoz (born 1 June 1988) is a French road bicycle racer, who currently rides for UCI ProTeam Team TotalEnergies.[5] He was originally a mountain bike racer before switching to road cycling, winning the French national under-23 mountain bike title twice and riding as part of the French national team that took the team relay title at the 2008 Mountain Bike World Championships.[2] He was a member of the Sojasun team that competed at the 2013 Tour de France,[6] finishing the race 46th overall. Vuillermoz joined Ag2r\u2013La Mondiale for the 2014 season, after his previous team \u2013 Sojasun \u2013 folded at the end of the 2013 season.[3] In the eighth stage of the 2015 Tour de France, Vuillermoz attacked the leading group on the Mûr-de-Bretagne to cross the line solo atop the hill.[7] \"After winning I thought about my dad who died three years ago. He was the one who got me interested in the Tour de France, he used to take my cousins and I to the side of the road to watch the Tour go past,\" said Vuillermoz. \"I hope today he's proud of me.\"[7] In 2016, Vuillermoz finished in 23rd position in the Olympics men's road race and in 29th position in the Olympic men's road time trial. He started the 2018 Tour de France, but was forced to abandon with a fractured scapula due to injuries sustained after colliding with a roadside spectator trying to take a photo in one of the cobbled sectors on stage 9 to Roubaix.[8] In October 2020, Vuillermoz signed a two-year contract with the Total Direct Énergie team, from the 2021 season.[9]","Title":"Alexis Vuillermoz - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8522","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Vuillermoz"}
