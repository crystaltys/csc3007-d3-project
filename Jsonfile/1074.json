{"Content: ":"The Calymmian Period (from Ancient Greek: κάλυμμα, romanized: kálymma, meaning \"cover\") is the first geologic period in the Mesoproterozoic Era and lasted from 1600 Mya to 1400 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically. The period is characterised by expansion of existing platform covers, or by new platforms on recently cratonized basements. The supercontinent Columbia started to break during the Calymmian some 1500 Mya.  This geochronology article is a stub.
