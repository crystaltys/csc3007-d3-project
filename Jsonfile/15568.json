{"Content: ":"Kharkiv (Ukrainian: Ха́рків, IPA: [ˈxɑrkiu̯] (listen)), also known as Kharkov (Russian: Харькoв, IPA: [ˈxarʲkəf]), is the second-largest city and municipality in Ukraine.[6] Located in the northeast of the country, it is the largest city of the historic Slobozhanshchyna region. Kharkiv is the administrative centre of Kharkiv Oblast and of the surrounding Kharkiv Raion. The latest population is 1,433,886 (2021 est.).[7] Kharkiv was founded in 1654 as Kharkiv fortress, and after these humble beginnings, it grew to be a major centre of industry, trade and Ukrainian culture in the Russian Empire. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was predominantly Russian in population, but after the Soviet government's policy of Ukrainization the city became populated mainly by Ukrainians with a significant number of Russians.[8][9] Kharkiv was the first capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, from December 1919 to January 1934, after which the capital relocated to Kyiv.[10] Kharkiv is a major cultural, scientific, educational, transport and industrial centre of Ukraine, with numerous museums, theatres and libraries, including the Annunciation and Dormition Cathedrals, the Derzhprom building in Freedom Square, and the National University of Kharkiv. Kharkiv was a host city for UEFA Euro 2012. Industry plays a significant role in Kharkiv's economy, specialized primarily in machinery and electronics. There are hundreds of industrial facilities throughout the city, including the Morozov Design Bureau and the Malyshev Tank Factory (leaders in world tank production from the 1930s to the 1980s); Khartron (aerospace, nuclear power plants and automation electronics); Turboatom (turbines for hydro-, thermal- and nuclear-power plants); and Antonov (the multipurpose aircraft manufacturing plant). Kharkiv was a major target of the Northeastern Ukraine offensive in Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022. During the Battle of Kharkiv, the city was designated as a Hero City of Ukraine.[11] Cultural artifacts date back to the Bronze Age, as well as those of later Scythian and Sarmatian settlers. The site was part of the Chernyakhov culture during the 2nd to the 6th centuries. The Khazar fortress of Verkhneye Saltovo (8th to 10th centuries) was about 25 miles (40 km) east of the modern city, near Staryi Saltiv.[12] During the 12th century, it was part of the territory of the Cumans. The fortress was founded by re-settlers fleeing the war that engulfed Right-bank Ukraine in 1654 (see Khmelnytsky Uprising).[1] Before that the region was a sparsely populated and part of the Cossack Hetmanate.[13] The group of people came onto the banks of Lopan and Kharkiv rivers where an abandoned settlement stood.[14] According to archive documents, the leader of the re-settlers was otaman Ivan Kryvoshlyk.[1] The fortress was named for the Kharkiv River. There is a folk etymology that connects the name of both the city and the river to a legendary cossack founder named Kharko[15] (a diminutive form of the name Chariton, Ukrainian: Харитон, romanized: Khariton,[1] or Zechariah, Ukrainian: Захарій, romanized: Zakharii).[16] J. B. Rudnyckyj in the 1950s established that the river name is attested earlier than the foundation of the fortress, in the late 16th century.[17] At first the settlement was self-governed under the jurisdiction of a voivode from Chuhuiv 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the east.[14] The first appointed voivode from Moscow was Voyin Selifontov in 1656, who began to build a local ostrog (fort).[14] At that time the population of Kharkiv was just over 1000, half of whom were local cossacks, while Selifontov brought with him a Moscow garrison of another 70 soldiers.[14] The first Kharkiv voivode was replaced in two years after constantly complaining that the locals refused to cooperate in building the fort.[14] Kharkiv also became the centre of the local sloboda cossack regiment, as the area surrounding the Belgorod fortress was being heavily militarized. With the resettlement of the area by Ukrainians it came to be known as Sloboda Ukraine, most of which was included under the jurisdiction of the Razryad Prikaz (Military Appointment) headed by a district official from Belgorod. By 1657 the Kharkiv settlement had a fortress[14] with underground passageways. In 1658 Ivan Ofrosimov was appointed as the new voivode, who worked on forcing locals to kiss the cross to show loyalty to Russian tsar.[14] The locals, led by their otaman Ivan Kryvoshlyk refused.[14] However, with the election of a new otaman, Tymish Lavrynov, the community (hromada) sent a request to the tsar to establish a local Assumption market, signed by the deans of Kharkiv churches (the Assumption Cathedral and parish churches of Annunciation and Trinity).[14] Relationships with the neighboring Chuhuiv sometimes were non-friendly and often their arguments were pacified by force.[14] With the appointment of the third voivode Vasiliy Sukhotin was completely finished the construction of the city fort.[14] Meanwhile, Kharkiv had become the centre of Sloboda Ukraine.[18] The Kharkiv Fortress was erected around the Assumption Cathedral and its castle was at University Hill.[14] It was between today's streets: vulytsia Kvitky-Osnovianenko, Constitution Square, Rose Luxemburg Square, Proletarian Square, and Cathedral Descent.[14] The fortress had 10 towers: Chuhuivska Tower, Moskovska Tower, Vestovska Tower, Tainytska Tower, Lopanska Corner Tower, Kharkivska Corner Tower and others.[14] The tallest was Vestovska, some 16 metres (52 ft) tall,[14] while the shortest one was Tainytska which had a secret well 35 metres (115 ft) deep.[14] The fortress had the Lopanski Gates.[14] In 1689 the fortress was expanded to include the Intercession Cathedral and Monastery, which became a seat of a local church hierarch, the Protopope.[14] Coincidentally in the same year in the vicinity of Kharkiv in Kolomak, Ivan Mazepa was announced the Hetman of Ukraine.[14] Kharkiv leading educational institution, the Collegium, was located next to the Intercession Cathedral. It was transferred from Bilhorod to Kharkiv in 1726.[14] In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Kyiv Governorate. Kharkiv is specifically mentioned as one of the towns making up a part of the governorate.[19] In 1727, Belgorod Governorate was split off, and Kharkiv moved to Belgorod Governorate. It was the center of a separate administrative unit, Kharkiv Sloboda Cossack regiment. The regiment at some point was detached from Belgorod Governorate, then attached to it again, until in 1765, Sloboda Ukraine Governorate was established with the seat in Kharkiv.[20] Kharkiv University was established in 1805 in the Palace of Governorate-General.[14] Alexander Mikolajewicz Mickiewicz, brother of Adam Mickiewicz was a professor of law in the university, another celebrity Goethe searched for instructors for the school.[14] In 1906 Ivan Franko received a doctorate in Russian linguistics here.[14][21] The streets were first cobbled in the city centre in 1830.[22] In 1844 the 90 metres (300 ft) tall Alexander Bell Tower was built next to the first Assumption Cathedral, which on 16 November 1924, was transformed into a radio tower.[14] A system of running water was established in 1870. The Cathedral Descent at one time carried the name of another local trader Vasyl Ivanovych Pashchenko-Tryapkin as Pashchenko Descent.[14] Pashchenko even leased a space to the city council (duma) and was the owner of the city \"Old Passage\", the city's biggest trade center.[14] After his death in 1894 Pashchenko donated all his possessions to the city.[14] Kharkiv became a major industrial centre and with it a centre of Ukrainian culture. In 1812, the first Ukrainian newspaper was published there.[23] One of the first Prosvitas in Eastern Ukraine was also established in Kharkiv. A powerful nationally aware political movement was also established there and the concept of an Independent Ukraine was first declared there by the lawyer Mykola Mikhnovsky in 1900. Soon after the Crimean War, in 1860\u201361 number of hromada societies sprung up across the Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv.[24] Among the most prominent hromada members in Kharkiv was Oleksandr Potebnia, a native of Sloboda Ukraine.[24] Beside the old hromada, in Kharkiv also existed several student hromadas members of which were future political leaders of Ukraine such as Borys Martos, Dmytro Antonovych and many others.[24] One of the University of Kharkiv graduates Oleksandr Kovalenko was one of initiators of the mutiny on Russian battleship Potemkin being the only officer who supported the in-rank sailors.[citation needed] Since April 1780 it was an administrative centre of Kharkov uyezd. Bolshevik Baltin in the \"Chronicle of the Revolution\" (Russian: Летопись Революции) noted that during the World War I in December 1914 Kharkiv experienced the most eerie Russian chauvinism (see, Great Russian chauvinism) which knew no limits when Russian ultra-nationalist Black Hundreds were assisted by a local police.[25] Baltin also stated that at that time the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory (employing 6,000 workers) was considered a \"citadel of revolutionary movement\"[25] yet due to pressure of the local police and the Russian nationalists the revolutionary life was completely suppressed.[25] In January 1915 the Kharkiv Bolshevik organization was accounted of no more than 10 people.[25] The Bolshevik organization in Kharkiv was revived after arrival of Aleksei Medvedev, Nikolay Lyakhin (Petrograd Bolsheviks) and Maksimov and Maria Skobeeva (Moscow Bolsheviks).[25] Following the Russian defeat during Gorlice\u2013Tarnów Offensive and start of the Great Retreat, to Kharkiv from Riga was evacuated a plant of the Public Company of Electricity (Russian: Всеобщая Компания Электричества) with 4,000 workers.[25] Baltin also pointed that national oppression during the First World War had increased and from it suffered especially Ukrainians.[25] With declaration of the war, there were closed all Ukrainian language newspapers and other periodicals.[25] During the \"Great Retreat\", the local pro-Ukrainian socialist-democrats managed to receive permission on publication of Ukrainophone newspaper \"Slovo\".[25] It was the first newspaper in Ukrainian language after a year of hiatus.[25] But soon the city administration fined the publisher of the newspaper, after which no other publisher wanted to print the newspaper.[25] When the Tsentralna Rada announced the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic in November 1917 it envisioned the Sloboda Ukraine Governorate to be part of it.[1] In December 1917 Kharkiv became the first city in Ukraine occupied by the Soviet troops of Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko.[26] The Bolsheviks in the Tsentralna Rada moved to Kharkiv shortly after to make it their stronghold and formed their own Rada on 13 December 1917.[26][27] By February 1918 Bolshevik forces had captured much of Ukraine.[28] In February 1918 Kharkiv became the capital of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic; but this entity was disbanded six weeks later.[29] In April 1918 the German army occupied Kharkiv.[30] And according to the February 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Central Powers it became part of the Ukrainian People's Republic.[31] Early January 1919 Bolshevik forces captured Kharkiv.[18] Mid-June 1919 Anton Denikin's White movement Volunteer Army captured the city.[32] In December 1919 the Bolshevik Red Army recaptured Kharkiv.[33] Prior to the formation of the Soviet Union, Bolsheviks established Kharkiv as the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (from 1919 to 1934) in opposition to the Ukrainian People's Republic with its capital of Kyiv.[34] According to linguist George Shevelov, in the early 1920s the share of secondary schools teaching in the Ukrainian language was lower than the share of the Kharkiv Oblasts ethnic Ukrainian population,[35] even though the Soviet Union had ordered that all schools in the Ukrainian SSR should be Ukrainian speaking (as part of its Ukrainization policy).[36] As the country's capital, it underwent intense expansion with the construction of buildings to house the newly established Ukrainian Soviet government and administration. Derzhprom was the second tallest building in Europe and the tallest in the Soviet Union at the time with a height of 63 metres (207 ft).[37] In the 1920s, a 150 metres (490 ft) wooden radio tower was built on top of the building. The Roentgen Institute was established in 1931.[38] During the interwar period the city saw the spread of architectural constructivism.[14] One of the best representatives of it was the already mentioned Derzhprom, the Building of the Red Army, the Ukrainian Polytechnic Institute of Distance Learning (UZPI), the City Council building, with its massive asymmetric tower, the central department store that was opened on the 15th Anniversary of the October Revolution.[14] The same year on 7 November 1932, the building of Noblemen Assembly was transformed into the building of All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee.[14][39][40] In 1928, the SVU (Union for the Freedom of Ukraine) process was initiated and court sessions were staged in the Kharkiv Opera (now the Philharmonia) building. Hundreds of Ukrainian intellectuals were arrested and deported.[citation needed] In the early 1930s, the Holodomor famine drove many people off the land into the cities, and to Kharkiv in particular, in search of food. Many people died and were secretly buried in mass graves in the cemeteries surrounding the city.[citation needed] In 1934 hundreds of Ukrainian writers, intellectuals and cultural workers were arrested and executed in the attempt to eradicate all vestiges of Ukrainian nationalism in Art. The purges continued into 1938. Blind Ukrainian street musicians Kobzars were also gathered in Kharkiv and murdered by the NKVD.[41] In January 1934 the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv.[10] During April and May 1940 about 3,900 Polish prisoners of Starobelsk camp were executed in the Kharkiv NKVD building, later secretly buried on the grounds of an NKVD pansionat in Pyatykhatky forest (part of the Katyn massacre) on the outskirts of Kharkiv.[42] The site also contains the numerous bodies of Ukrainian cultural workers who were arrested and shot in the 1937\u201338 Stalinist purges. During World War II, Kharkiv was the site of several military engagements (see below). The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 24 October 1941.[43][44] A disastrous Red Army offensive that failed to capture the city in May 1942.[45][46] The city was successfully retaken by the Soviets on 16 February 1943. It was captured for a second time by the Germans on 15 March 1943. It was then finally retaken on 23 August 1943. Seventy percent of the city was destroyed and tens of thousands of the inhabitants were killed.[47] Kharkiv, the third largest city in the Soviet Union, was the most populous city in the Soviet Union captured by the Germans, since in the years preceding World War II, Kyiv was by population the smaller of the two. The significant Jewish population of Kharkiv (Kharkiv's Jewish community prided itself on having the second largest synagogue in Europe) suffered greatly during the war. Between December 1941 and January 1942, an estimated 15,000 Jews were killed and buried in a mass grave by the Germans in a ravine outside of town named Drobytsky Yar.[48] During World War II, four battles took place for control of the city: Before the occupation, Kharkiv's tank industries were evacuated to the Urals with all their equipment, and became the heart of Red Army's tank programs (particularly, producing the T-34 tank earlier designed in Kharkiv). These enterprises returned to Kharkiv after the war, and continued to produce tanks. Of the population of 700,000 that Kharkiv had before the start of World War II, 120,000 became Ost-Arbeiter (slave worker) in Germany, 30,000 were executed and 80,000 starved to death during the war.[18] In the post-World War II period, many of the destroyed homes and factories were rebuilt. The city was planned to be rebuilt in the style of Stalinist Classicism.[14] From 1961 to 1975, the Kharkov Highest Artillery School of Engineering existed for the RVSN (Strategic Rocket Forces).[49] An airport was built in 1954. Following the war, Kharkiv was the third largest scientific and industrial centre in the former USSR (after Moscow and Leningrad).[citation needed] In 1975, the Kharkiv subway was opened. By its territorial expansion on 6 September 2012, the city increased its area from about 310 to 350 square kilometres (120 to 140 sq mi).[50] A well-known landmark of Kharkiv is the Freedom Square (Ploshcha Svobody formerly known as Dzerzhinsky Square), which is the ninth largest city square in Europe, and the 28th largest square in the world. The underground rapid-transit system (metro) has about 38.7 km (24 mi) of track and 30 stations. The newest underground station, Peremoha, was opened on 19 August 2016.[51] All the underground stations have very distinctive architecture. Kharkiv was a host city for UEFA Euro 2012, and hosted three group soccer matches at the reconstructed Metalist Stadium. Many orthodox churches were built in Kharkiv in the 1990s and 2000s.[citation needed] For example, Church of Myrrh-bearing Women, Church of St. Vladimir, Church of St. Tamara, etc. In 2006 an improvised explosive device exploded near a supermarket.[52] In 2007, the city's Vietnamese minority built the largest Buddhist temple in Europe on a one-hectare plot, with a monument to Ho Chi Minh.[53] Gorky Park was fully renovated in the 2000s, with many modern attractions, a lake with lilies and sport facilities to play tennis, football, beach volleyball, and basketball. Feldman Park was created in recent years, containing a big collection of animals, horses, etc. A judge and his family were decapitated in 2012 in the Kharkiv beheadings.[54] The Euromaidan protests in the winter of 2013\u20132014 against then president Viktor Yanukovych consisted of daily gatherings of about 200 protestors near the statue of Taras Shevchenko end were predominantly peaceful.[55] Pro-Yanukovych demonstrations, held near the statue of Lenin, were similarly small.[55] The 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine affected Kharkiv but to a lesser extent than in neighbouring Donbass, where tensions led to armed conflict.[56] On 2 March 2014, a Russian \"tourist\" from Moscow replaced the Ukrainian flag with a Russian flag on the Kharkiv regional state administration building.[57] On 6 April 2014 pro-Russian protestors occupied the building and unilaterally declared independence from Ukraine as the \"Kharkiv People's Republic\".[55][58] The uprising was quelled in less than two days due to rapid reaction of the Ukrainian security forces under then Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and Stepan Poltorak the then acting commander of the Ukrainian Internal Forces.[55][59] A special forces unit from Vinnytsia was sent to the city to crush the separatists.[55] Doubts arose about the local origin of the protestors after they initially stormed an opera and ballet theatre believing it was the city hall.[60] On 13 April, some pro-Russian protesters again made it inside the Kharkiv regional state administration building.[61] Later on 13 April, the building permanently returned to full Ukrainian control.[58][59][61][62][63][64][65] Violent clashes resulted in the severe beating of at least 50 pro-Ukrainian protesters in attacks by pro-Russian protesters.[61][64] The mayor of the city, Hennadiy Kernes, who supported the Orange Revolution but later joined the Party of Regions, decided to side with the Ukrainian government.[55] Kharkiv returned to relative calm by 30 April.[66] Relatively peaceful demonstrations continued to be held, with \"pro-Russian\" rallies gradually diminishing and \"pro-Ukrainian unity\" demonstrations growing in numbers.[67][68][69] On 28 September, activists dismantled Ukraine's largest monument to Lenin at a pro-Ukrainian rally in the central square.[70] Polls conducted from September to December 2014 found little support in Kharkiv for joining Russia.[71][72] From early November until mid-December, Kharkiv was struck by seven non-lethal bomb blasts. Targets of these attacks included a rock pub known for raising money for Ukrainian forces, a hospital for Ukrainian forces, a military recruiting centre, and a National Guard base.[73] According to SBU investigator Vasyliy Vovk, Russian covert forces were behind the attacks, and had intended to destabilize the otherwise calm city of Kharkiv.[74] On 8 January 2015 five men wearing balaclavas broke into an office of Station Kharkiv, a volunteer group aiding refugees from Donbass.[75] Simultaneously with physical threats the men demanded to hear the political position of Station Kharkiv.[75] After having been given an answer, the men apologized and left.[75] On Sunday 22 February 2015, an improvised explosive device in 2015 killed four people and wounded nine during a march commemorating the Euromaidan victims.[55] The authorities launched an 'anti-terrorist operation'.[76] Kharkiv has experienced more non-lethal small bombings since 22 February 2015 targeting army fuel tanks, an unoccupied passenger train and a Ukrainian flag in the city centre.[77] On 23 September 2015, 200 people in balaclavas and camouflage picketed the house of former governor Mykhailo Dobkin, and then went to Kharkiv town hall, where they tried to force their way through the police cordon. At least one tear gas grenade was used. The rioters asked the mayor, Hennadiy Kernes, to come out.[78][79] Until 18 July 2020, Kharkiv was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Kharkiv Raion though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kharkiv Oblast to seven, the city of Kharkiv was merged into Kharkiv Raion.[80][81] A nursing home fire in 2021 killed 15 people.[82] Kharkiv's Mayor for ten years, Hennadiy Kernes, died on 17 December 2020 in Berlin of COVID-19.[83][84] Ihor Terekhov of Kernes's party Kernes Bloc \u2014 Successful Kharkiv succeeded him in November 2021.[3][4] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kharkiv was the site of heavy fighting between the Ukrainian and Russian forces.[85] On 27 February, the governor of Kharkiv Oblast Oleh Synyehubov claimed that Russian troops were repelled from Kharkiv.[86] According to a 28 February 2022, report from Agroportal 24h, the Kharkiv Tractor Plant (KhTZ), in the south east of the city, was destroyed and \u201cengulfed in fire\u201d by \u201cmassive shelling\u201d from Russian forces.[87] Video purported to record explosions and fire at the plant on 25 and 27 February 2022.[88][89] On 4 March 2022, Human Rights Watch reported that on the fourth day of the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, 28 February 2022, Federation forces used cluster munitions in the KhTZ district, the Moskovskyi district and Shevchenkivskyi district of the city. The rights group\u2014which noted the \"inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and their foreseeable effects on civilians\"\u2014based its assessment on interviews and an analysis of 40 videos and photographs.[90] The battle for the city has been described as one of the deadliest battles in the invasion, with a Ukrainian presidential advisor describing it as the \"Stalingrad of the 21st century.\"[91] Kharkiv is located at the banks of the Kharkiv, Lopan, and Udy rivers, where they flow into the Seversky Donets watershed in the north-eastern region of Ukraine. Historically, Kharkiv lies in the Sloboda Ukraine region (Slobozhanshchyna also known as Slobidshchyna) in Ukraine, in which it is considered to be the main city. The approximate dimensions of city of Kharkiv are: from the North to the South \u2014 24.3 km; from the West to the East \u2014 25.2 km. Based on Kharkiv's topography, the city can be conditionally divided into four lower districts and four higher districts. The highest point above sea level, in Pyatikhatky, is 202m, and the lowest is Novoselivka in Kharkiv is 94m.[citation needed] Kharkiv lies in the large valley of rivers of Kharkiv, Lopan', Udy, and Nemyshlya. This valley lies from the North West to the South East between the Mid Russian highland and Donetsk lowland. All the rivers interconnect in Kharkiv and flow into the river of Northern Donets. A special system of concrete and metal dams was designed and built by engineers to regulate the water level in the rivers in Kharkiv.[citation needed] Kharkiv has a large number of green city parks with a long history of more than 100 years with very old oak trees and many flowers.[citation needed] Gorky park, or Maxim Gorky Central Park for Culture and Recreation, is Kharkiv's largest public garden. The park has nine areas: children, extreme sports, family entertainment, a medieval area, entertainment center, French park, cable car, sports grounds, retro park. Kharkiv's climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb) with long, cold, snowy winters and warm to hot summers. The average rainfall totals 519 mm (20 in) per year, with the most in June and July. The Mayor of Kharkiv and the City Council govern all the business and administrative affairs in the City of Kharkiv. The Mayor of Kharkiv has the executive powers; the City Council has the administrative powers as far as the government issues are concerned. The Mayor of Kharkiv is elected by direct public election in Kharkiv every four years. The City Council is composed of elected representatives, who approve or reject the initiatives on the budget allocation, tasks priorities and other issues in Kharkiv. The representatives to the City Council are elected every four years. The mayor and city council hold their regular meetings in the City Hall in Kharkiv. While Kharkiv is the administrative centre of the Kharkiv Oblast (province), the city affairs are managed by the Kharkiv Municipality. Kharkiv is a city of oblast subordinance. The territory of Kharkiv is divided into 9 administrative raions (districts), till February 2016 they were named for people, places, events, and organizations associated with early years of the Soviet Union but many were renamed in February 2016 to comply with decommunization laws.[2] Also, owing to this law, over 200 streets have been renamed in Kharkiv since 20 November 2015.[94] The raions are named:[2][95] According to the 1989 Soviet Union Census, the population of the city was 1,593,970. In 1991, it decreased to 1,510,200, including 1,494,200 permanent residents.[108] Kharkiv is the second-largest city in Ukraine after the capital, Kyiv.[109] The first independent all-Ukrainian population census was conducted in December 2001, and the next all-Ukrainian population census is decreed to be conducted in 2020. As of 2001, the population of the Kharkiv region is as follows: 78.5% living in urban areas, and 21.5% living in rural areas.[110] Kharkiv is an important religious centre in Eastern Ukraine. There are many old and new religious buildings, associated with various denominations in Kharkiv. The St. Assumption Orthodox Cathedral was built in Kharkiv in the 1680s and re-built in 1820s-1830s.[115] The St. Trinity Orthodox Church was built in Kharkiv in 1758\u20131764 and re-built in 1857\u20131861.[116] The St. Annunciation Orthodox Cathedral, one of the tallest Orthodox churches in the world, was completed in Kharkiv on 2 October 1888.[117] Recently built churches include the St. Valentine Orthodox Church and the St. Tamara Orthodox Church.[118][119] Kharkiv's Jewish population is estimated to be around 8,000 people.[120] It is served by the old Kharkiv Choral Synagogue, which was fully renovated in Kharkiv in 1991\u20132016. There are two mosques including the Kharkiv Cathedral Mosque and one Islamic center in Kharkiv.[citation needed] The 2016\u20132020 economic development strategy: \"Kharkiv Success Strategy\", is created in Kharkiv.[121][122][123] Kharkiv has a diversified service economy, with employment spread across a wide range of professional services, including financial services, manufacturing, tourism, and high technology. The International Economic Forum: Innovations. Investments. Kharkiv Innitiatives! is being conducted in Kharkiv every year.[124] In 2015, the International Economic Forum: Innovations. Investments. Kharkiv Innitiatives! was attended by the diplomatic corps representatives from 17 world countries, working in Ukraine together with top-management of trans-national corporations and investment funds; plus Ukrainian People's Deputies; plus Ukrainian Central government officials, who determine the national economic development strategy; plus local government managers, who perform practical steps in implementing that strategy; plus managers of technical assistance to Ukraine; plus business and NGO's representatives; plus media people.[124][125][126][127][128] The key topics of the plenary sessions and panel discussions of the International Economic Forum: Innovations. Investments. Kharkiv Innitiatives! are the implementation of Strategy for Sustainable Development \"Ukraine \u2013 2020\", the results achieved and plan of further actions to reform the local government and territorial organization of power in Ukraine, export promotion and attraction of investments in Ukraine, new opportunities for public-private partnerships, practical steps to create \"electronic government\", issues of energy conservation and development of oil and gas industry in the Kharkiv Region, creating an effective system of production and processing of agricultural products, investment projects that will receive funding from the State Fund for Regional Development, development of international integration, preparation for privatization of state enterprises.[124][125][126][127][128] The international industrial exhibitions are usually conducted at the Radmir Expohall exhibition center in Kharkiv.[129] During the Soviet era, Kharkiv was the capital of industrial production in Ukraine and a large centre of industry and commerce in the USSR. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the largely defence-systems-oriented industrial production of the city decreased significantly. In the early 2000s, the industry started to recover and adapt to market economy needs. The enterprises form machine-building, electro-technology, instrument-making, and energy conglomerates. State-owned industrial giants, such as Turboatom and Elektrotyazhmash[130] occupy 17% of the heavy power equipment construction (e.g., turbines) market worldwide. Multipurpose aircraft are produced by the Antonov aircraft manufacturing plant. The Malyshev factory produces not only armoured fighting vehicles, but also harvesters. Khartron[131] is the leading designer of space and commercial control systems in Ukraine and the former CIS. As of April 2018, there were 25,000 specialists in IT industry of the Kharkiv region, 76% of them were related to computer programming. Thus, Kharkiv accounts for 14% of all IT specialists in Ukraine and makes the second largest IT location in the country, right after the capital Kyiv.[132] Also, the number of active IT companies in the region to be 445, five of them employing more than 601 people. Besides, there are 22 large companies with the workers' number ranging from 201 to 600. More than half of IT-companies located in the Kharkiv region fall into \"extra small\" category with less than 20 persons engaged. The list is compiled with 43 medium (81-200 employers) and 105 small companies (21-80).[citation needed] Due to the comparably narrow market for IT services in Ukraine, the majority of Kharkiv companies are export-oriented with more than 95% of total sales generated overseas in 2017. Overall, the estimated revenue of Kharkiv IT companies will more than double from $800 million in 2018 to $1.85 billion by 2025.
