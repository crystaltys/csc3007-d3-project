Inspired by Islamic humanitarian values, it works with Muslim and non-Muslim communities around the world. The charity registered with the Charity Commission of England and Wales in 1989 and remains an independent non-political non-governmental organisation (NGO). Islamic Relief has been responding to humanitarian crises around the world for the past 37 years with an aim to reduce the impact of conflicts and natural disasters. It focuses on ensuring rapid response, providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people.

The Declaration makes an Islamic faith-endorsed case for protecting the environment with support from global Muslim leaders. It was launched at the Istanbul Symposium and presented at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21). In 2017, Islamic Relief implemented 50 projects worldwide to reduce the impact of climate change.[19] In 2018, at the UN Commission on the Status of Women conference in New York (CSW62) Islamic Relief announced a forthcoming Islamic Declaration on Gender Justice.[21] The Declaration is a call to action against gender inequality from an Islamic faith perspective, and seeks to tackle discrimination and harmful practices, especially against women and girls in Muslim communities.

In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in Israel, for allegedly funding Hamas. The charity's West Bank offices were raided and their computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened. In late 2014, Islamic Relief claimed[24] that an audit carried out by an unnamed \"leading global audit firm\" found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by claiming its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was \"based on information that has been accumulated over years, that the fund is a central player in financing of Hamas\". The organisation has challenged the decision in Israeli courts.[25] Subsequently, on 15 November 2014, the United Arab Emirates placed Islamic Relief on a list of proscribed organisations due to alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.[26][27] The organisation denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood[28] citing the organisation's neutral stance and humanitarian nature. In 2016, it was reported that the banking group HSBC decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief over concerns that \"cash meant for humanitarian aid could potentially end up with terrorist groups abroad\".[29] HSBC invited Islamic Relief to \"end the relationship\", which the bank did in any case at the end of 2014, as it has with other aid and civil society organisations.[30] The government of Bangladesh barred the organisation from aiding the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, alleging funds were used to preach Islam, construct mosques, encourage radicalism, and fund militants.[31] Islamic Relief refutes these allegations and continues its work across Bangladesh, where it has been present for over 25 years.[32] As of April 2021, the government of Bangladesh was working with Islamic Relief to aid Rohingya refugees.[33] In 2019 the German government allege they have \"significant personal ties\" with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was denied by Islamic Relief.[34][35] In July 2020, Islamic Relief's director Heshmat Khalifa resigned after The Times discovered he had made antisemitic remarks on his Facebook page in 2014 and 2015.[36] In an interview with The Guardian, CEO Naser Haghamed said he was \"appalled\" by the \"unacceptable posts\".[37] Miguel Ángel Moratinos, High-Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), expressed dismay regarding Khalifa's outbursts, including labelling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a \"pimp son of the Jews\" and calling the Israeli government the \"grandchildren of monkeys and pigs.\"[38] In late August, it was announced that the entire board would be resigning in what was described as \"a part of far-reaching governance reforms\u201d.[39][40] In January 2021, the Charity Commission of England and Wales, completed a compliance case into the organisation stating that it was \"satisfied that it is making the necessary improvements in terms of the vetting of trustees, and ongoing oversight over their social media activities.\"[41] Additionally, the Dutch government announced that they would give no public funds to IRW after allegations of connections to the Muslim Brotherhood in the media.[42] In late January 2021, an Independent Commission headed by former UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve, concluded that \"the offensive views articulated by the former senior director and two former trustees did not in any way compromise the impartiality or integrity of the organization\u2019s humanitarian programmes.\"[43]","Title":"Islamic Relief - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9075","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Relief"}
