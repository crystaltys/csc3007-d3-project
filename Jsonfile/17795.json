{"Content: ":"The Archdiocese of São Paulo (Latin: Archidioecesis Sancti Pauli in Brasilia) is a Latin Metropolitan Archbishopric of the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil. The Archdiocese is currently headed by Odilo Scherer since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 March 2007, an appointment that ended almost four decades of Franciscan leadership in the archdiocese: both predecessors, Cardinals Paulo Evaristo Arns and Cláudio Hummes, belonged to that Order. Its cathedral episcopal see, the Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora da Assunção e São Paulo, in the metropolis São Paulo, was dedicated to the Assumption of Mary on September 5, 1964. The city also has three minor basilicas : Basílica de Nossa Senhora da Assunção, Basílica de Nossa Senhora do Carmo (both also Marian) and Basílica do Santíssimo Sacramento (dedicated to the Holly Sacrament). Its ecclesiastical province comprises the Metropolitan's own Archdiocese and these Suffragan bishoprics, mostly Latin too, but also a few Eastern Catholic, notably Byzantine Rite : Coordinates: 23°33\u203204\u2033S 46°38\u203204\u2033W﻿ / ﻿23.55111°S 46.63444°W﻿ / -23.55111; -46.63444","Title":"Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Paulo - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17795","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo"}
