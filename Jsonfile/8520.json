{"Content: ":"One-day races and Classics Simon Geschke (born 13 March 1986) is a German professional road cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Cofidis.[2][3] He is the son of former track cyclist JÃ¼rgen Geschke. In the 2015 Tour de France, Geschke won a mountain stage as he was part of the breakaway and soloed across the line in Pra-Loup.[4] In 2022 Geschke entered the Tour de France for the tenth time in his career. For the first time in his career he wore a classification jersey after getting involved in the breakaway on stage 9, and earning enough points to take the lead in the mountains classification. Initially it was his intent to go for the stage win rather than the jersey classification.[5][6] He chose to attack for the mountain points on stage nine because he did not feel it would be realistic to attack in the upcoming high mountains, which included five HC climbs with Col du Granon and Alpe d'Huez being among them, however he was able to defend the jersey through these climbs in the Alps and into the third week of the race. He lost the jersey on the final HC climb of the Tour de France when Jonas Vingegaard won the race.[7] He set a record for German riders with nine days as King of the Mountains. Geschke has been a vegan since 2016.[8]  Media related to Simon Geschke at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"Simon Geschke - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8520","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Geschke"}
