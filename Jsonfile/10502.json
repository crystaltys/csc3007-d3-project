The prison in question has also been reported to have experienced overcrowding issues making the government's claims of having the situation under control seem dubious.[83] Three Belgian parliamentarians in April 2021 wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, Sophie Wilmès, demanding her to urge the Bahraini government to look into the COVID-19 situation inside its prisons. Amongst the three parliamentarians, MP François De Smet cited that difficulty in controlling communicable diseases inside prisons is a global issue.
