{"Content: ":"Phenoptosis (pheno \u2013 showing or demonstrating, ptosis \u2013 programmed death, \"falling off\"), the term was proposed by V.P. Skulachev in 1999. It signifies the phenomenon of programmed death of an organism, i.e. that an organism's genes include features that under certain circumstances will cause the organism to rapidly degenerate and die off. Recently this has been referred to as \"fast phenoptosis\" as aging is being explored as \"slow phenoptosis\".[1] Phenoptosis is a common feature of living species, whose ramifications for humans is still being explored. The concept of programmed cell death was used before, by Lockshin & Williams[2] in 1964 in relation to insect tissue development, around eight years before \"apoptosis\" was coined. Inside of our bodies, worn-out, ineffective cells are dismantled and recycled for the greater good of the whole organism.[3] This is a process called apoptosis. It is believed that phenoptosis is an evolutionary mechanism that culls out the damaged, aged, infectious, or those in direct competition with their own offspring[4] for the good of the species. Special circumstances need to exist for the \"phenoptosis\" strategy to be an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), let alone the only ESS. Examples of \"phenoptosis\" given below are really examples of semelpary - a life history with a single reproduction followed by death, which evolves not \"for the good of the species\" but as the ESS in the conditions of high adult-to-juvenile mortality ratio. The elimination of parts detrimental to the organism or individuals detrimental to the species has been deemed \"The samurai law of biology\" \u2013 it is better to die than to be wrong.[5] Stress-induced, acute, or fast phenoptosis is the rapid deterioration of an organism induced by a life event such as breeding. Elimination of the parent provides space for fitter offspring. As a species this has been advantageous particularly to species that die immediately after spawning.[4] Age-induced, soft, or slow phenoptosis is the slow deterioration and death of an organism due to accumulated stresses over long periods of time. In short, it has been proposed that aging, heart disease, cancer, and other age related ailments are means of phenoptosis. \"Death caused by aging clears the population of ancestors and frees space for progeny carrying new useful traits.\"[5] It has also been proposed that age provides a selective advantage to brains over brawn.[6] An example made by V. P. Skulachev provides that of two hares, one faster and one smarter, the faster hare may have a selective advantage in youth but as aging occurs and muscles deteriorate it is the smarter hare that now has the selective advantage. Mitochondrial ROS \u2013 The production of ROS by the mitochondria. This causes oxidative damage to the inner compartment of the mitochondria and destruction of the mitochondria.[7] Clk1 gene \u2013 the gene thought to be responsible to aging due to mitochondrial ROS.[14] EF2 kinase \u2013 Blocks phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 thus blocking protein synthesis.[15] Glucocorticoid regulation \u2013 A common route for phenoptosis is breakdown of glucocorticoid regulation and inhibition, leading to massive excess of these corticosteroids in the body.[5] Robert Sapolsky discusses phenoptosis in his book Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, 3rd Ed., p. 245-247. He states that: If you catch salmon right after they spawn... you find they have huge adrenal glands, peptic ulcers, and kidney lesions, their immune systems have collapsed... [and they] have stupendously high glucocorticoid concentrations in their bloodstreams. When salmon spawn, regulation of their glucocortocoid secretion breaks down... But is the glucocorticoid excess really responsible for their death? Yup. Take a salmon right after spawning, remove its adrenals, and it will live for a year afterward. The bizarre thing is that this sequence... not only occurs in five species of salmon, but also among a dozen species of Australian marsupial mice... Pacific salmon and marsupial mice are not close relatives. At least twice in evolutionary history, completely independently, two very different sets of species have come up with the identical trick: if you want to degenerate very fast, secrete a ton of glucocorticoids.","Title":"Phenoptosis - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12248","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenoptosis"}
