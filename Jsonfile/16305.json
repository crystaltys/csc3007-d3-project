{"Content: ":"On 7 May 2022, a school in Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast, was bombed by Russian forces during the Battle of Sievierodonetsk[1] in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The death of at least two people was confirmed while authorities said the actual death toll was close to 60.[2] About ninety people were sheltering inside the building's basement at the time,[3] which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was the majority of the village's population.[1] The building was hit by a Russian airstrike, setting the building on fire and trapping large numbers of people inside.[4] At least 30 people were rescued.[5] Two people were confirmed to have been killed, but Governor of Luhansk Oblast Serhiy Haidai said that the 60 remaining people were believed to have been killed.[6][7] The attack was condemned by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry,[3] and UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, who said he was \"appalled\" by the attack.[8][9] Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, said that she was \"horrified\" and described the attack as constituting war crimes.[10] This Ukrainian history-related article is a stub.
