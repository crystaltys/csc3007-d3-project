{"Content: ":"The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPF; Tamil: தமிழ் முற்போக்கு கூட்டணி Tamiḻ Muṟpōkku Kūṭṭaṇi) is a Sri Lankan political alliance. It was formed in 2015 by the Democratic People's Front (DPF), National Union of Workers (NUW) and the Up-Country People's Front (UCPF) to represent the 1.5 million Tamils, mostly Indian Tamils, living outside the Northern and Eastern provinces.[1][2][3] On 3 June 2015 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Mano Ganesan, Palani Digambaran and Velusami Radhakrishnan, leaders of the DPF, NUW and UPCF respectively, at the Taj Samudra hotel in Colombo.[1] Ganesan was appointed leader of the TPF whilst Digambaran and Radhakrishnan were appointed deputy leaders.[1][2] A. Lawrence, the secretary of the UCPF, was appointed general-secretary of the TPF.[4] Although the alliance was focusing on issues affecting Tamil people, particularly Indian Tamils, it would also serve Sinhalese and Muslims.[2] The Ceylon Workers' Congress, the largest political party representing Indian Tamils was excluded from the alliance.[3] The alliance would not contest elections but would fight for the political rights of Tamils.[5][6] On 5 June 2014 the three members of the alliance announced that they would contest the then upcoming 2015 Sri Lankan parliamentary election in alliance with the United National Party.[7]","Title":"Tamil Progressive Alliance - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14407","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Progressive_Alliance"}
