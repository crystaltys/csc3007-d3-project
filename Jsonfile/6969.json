{"Content: ":"The German Archaeological Institute (German: Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, DAI) is a research institute in the field of archaeology (and other related fields).[2] The DAI is a \"federal agency\" under the Federal Foreign Office of Germany.[3][4] Eduard Gerhard founded the institute. Upon his departure from Rome in 1832, the headquarters of the Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica, as it was then named, was established in Berlin.[5] Its predecessor institute was founded there by Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, Theodor Panofka and August Kestner in 1829. Hans-Joachim Gehrke was President of the Institute from March 2008 to April 2011,[6] and has been succeeded by Friederike Fless.[7][8] The DAI currently has offices in cities including Madrid, Rome, Istanbul, Athens, Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, Tehran and Sana'a.[9][10] The DAI's Romano-Germanic Commission (Römisch-Germanische Kommission) includes the world's largest library for prehistoric archaeology and is located in Frankfurt. Its commission for the History of Classical Antiquity is in Munich and its Commission for the Archaeology of Non-European Cultures is located in Bonn.
