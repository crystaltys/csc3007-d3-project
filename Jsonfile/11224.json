The delivery of the first 1 million doses arrived on 21 February.[2] In March, India's decision to ban exports of vaccines created uncertainty over whether Nepal would be able to continue its vaccinations. By April, SII had only provided half of the 2 million doses for which Nepal had paid in full. A spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs rejected the notion of an export ban and said \u201cWe will export vaccines taking into account the domestic demand.\u201d[3] By late July, there was still uncertainty in Nepal over when SII would deliver the vaccines that were purchased, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India would \"resume the supply of vaccines soon.\"[4] Nepal approved China's Sinopharm BIBP vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) for emergency use on 15 February. The first doses arrived in Nepal on 29 March.[2] By July, China, had provided 1.8 million doses of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine under grant assistance, and committed to providing another 1.6 million doses.

At that time, the virus had claimed 2,017 lives and infected 270,092 across the country. Around 430,000 frontline workers\u2013health workers, supporting staffers at health facilities, female community health volunteers, security personnel, sanitation workers, elderly people living in care homes, and prisoners\u2013were listed as priority groups for vaccination.
