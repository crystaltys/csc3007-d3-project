{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in the Pitcairn Islands is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached the islands on 16 July 2022.[2] The Pitcairn Islands are a remote island chain in the Pacific consisting of the islands Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno. They are the last British Overseas Territory in the Pacific.[3] The islands have approximately 50 inhabitants.[4] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[5][6] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[7][8] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[9][7] As a precautionary measure, the Pitcairn Islands Government closed the territories' borders. As a result, all passenger services to the Islands were suspended in mid-March 2020.[10] The territory's entire population was vaccinated in May 2021, with vaccines that arrived via ship from New Zealand.[11][12][13] As of 28 February, 2022, 106 vaccines have been administered.[14] In March 2022, the Pitcairn Islands reopened its border to international travel. Regular shipping with French Polynesia resumed on 5 July 2022.[15] On 16 July, the Pitcairn Islands reported its first case.[2] On 20 July, the Pitcairn Islands reported 3 cases, bringing the total number of cases to 4.[16] This article about the COVID-19 pandemic is a stub.
