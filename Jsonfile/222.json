{"Content: ":"Hypertrophy (/haɪˈpɜːrtrəfi/, from Greek ὑπέρ \"excess\" + τροφή \"nourishment\") is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells.[1] It is distinguished from hyperplasia, in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number.[2] Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the hormonally-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy. Eccentric hypertrophy is a type of hypertrophy where the walls and chamber of a hollow organ undergo growth in which the overall size and volume are enlarged. It is applied especially to the left ventricle of heart.[3] Sarcomeres are added in series, as for example in dilated cardiomyopathy (in contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a type of concentric hypertrophy, where sarcomeres are added in parallel).
