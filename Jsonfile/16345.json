{"Content: ":"The eleventh emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly opened on 28 February 2022 at United Nations headquarters.[1] It addresses the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Maldivian politician Abdulla Shahid served as President of the body during this time. The session was temporarily adjourned on 2 March following the adoption of Resolution ES-11/1, which deplored the invasion and demanded a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.[2] It reconvened on 23 and 24 March to adopt Resolution ES-11/2, which reiterated the exhortations made in Resolution ES-11/1 and called for the full protection of civilians, including humanitarian personnel, journalists and vulnerable persons, and again on 7 April to adopt Resolution ES-11/3, which suspended Russia's membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council.[3] An emergency special session[4] is an unscheduled meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to make urgent, but non-binding decisions or recommendations regarding a particular issue. Emergency special sessions are rare, having been convened only eleven times in the history of the United Nations.[5] The mechanism of the emergency special session[4] was created in 1950 by the General Assembly's adoption of its \"Uniting for Peace\" resolution, which made the necessary changes to the Assembly's Rules of Procedure.[6] The resolution likewise declared that: ... if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security. If not in session at the time, the General Assembly may meet in emergency special session within twenty-four hours of the request therefor. Such emergency special session shall be called if requested by the Security Council on the vote of any seven members, or by a majority of the Members of the United Nations... These conditions were deemed to have been met following the Russian Federation's use of its veto power within the United Nations Security Council on 25 February to defeat draft resolution S/2022/155 deploring the invasion and calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops.[7][8][9] At the UN Security Council, Albania co-sponsored a resolution with the US for an emergency General Assembly session to be held regarding the invasion of Ukraine.[10][11] On 27 February 2022, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2623 (2022), calling for an emergency special session to examine the matter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[12] Eleven members of the Security Council voted in favour, with Russia voting against and China, India, and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. The resolution was passed despite Russia's negative vote because permanent members of the Security Council do not have veto power over procedural matters, such as a vote to convene an emergency special session.[1][9] Prior to Resolution 2623, the Uniting for Peace resolution had been invoked to call emergency sessions of the General Assembly on 12 occasions: seven times by the Security Council and five times by the General Assembly. At the start of the special session on 28 February 2022, General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid of the Republic of Maldives called for the delegations to observe a minute's silence.[13] Russia defended its military operation in Ukraine, and blamed the violence on the Ukrainian government.[14] Ukraine's representative to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, condemned Russia's acts as \"war crimes\" and called Putin's decision to increase the nuclear readiness \"madness\". He warned, \"If Ukraine does not survive, international peace will not survive. If Ukraine does not survive, the United Nations will not survive. ... If Ukraine does not survive, we cannot be surprised if democracy fails.\"[15] Around a hundred delegations lodged requests to address the assembly.[13] On 2 March, the meeting adopted \u2013 by a vote of 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions[16] \u2013 a non-binding resolution reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, deploring Russia's aggression and Belarus's involvement in it, and demanding the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the territory of Ukraine.[2] It also resolved to temporarily adjourn the emergency special session, authorizing the General Assembly President to resume its meetings upon request from member states.[17] On 23 March the session was continued and two more competing resolutions were introduced. Ukraine introduced the resolution \"Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine\" (A/ES-11/L.2) and South Africa the \"Humanitarian situation emanating out of the conflict in Ukraine\" (A/ES-11/L.3) resolution.[19] On 24 March resolution A/ES-11/L.2 received 140 votes in favour and five against, with 38 countries abstaining.[20] Resolution ES-11/2 reaffirmed the member states' existing commitments and obligations under the United Nations Charter and reiterated the General Assembly's demand that Russia withdraw from Ukraine's recognized sovereign territory; it also deplored, expressed grave concern over and condemned attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure. Fourteen principles were agreed. Briefly, the principles demanded the full implementation of resolution ES-11/1, immediate cessation of the hostilities by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, full protection of civilians \u2013 including humanitarian personnel, journalists and persons in vulnerable situations \u2013 and encouraged \"continued negotiation\".[21] The emergency special session reconvened on 7 April to discuss a resolution co-sponsored by 53 delegations to suspend Russia's membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council on account of reported \"violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights\".[22] In introducing the draft resolution, Sergiy Kyslytsya, Permanent Representative of Ukraine, reminded the Assembly of the UN's failure to take determined action to prevent the Rwandan genocide in 1994, a tragedy the UN commemorates every year on 7 April. He drew a parallel between Rwanda's presence as a non-permanent member of the Security Council at the time and Russia's permanent Security Council seat: the former had enabled Rwanda's \"genocidal regime\" to influence other members with its perspective on the situation, while the latter allowed Russia \"to spread lies almost daily\". Those delegations planning to abstain in the vote, he said, would be showing the same indifference that failed to prevent genocide in Rwanda.[23] In response, Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy permanent representative with responsibility for human rights issues,[24] denounced the draft as an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and to exert human rights colonialism, and he warned that his country's exclusion from the Human Rights Council could set a dangerous precedent. Addressing the allegations of abuses levelled at the Russian military, he said they were based on \"staged events and widely circulated fakes\".[23][25] The resolution was adopted by 93 votes to 24, with 58 abstentions. This was only the second occasion on which a state's membership in the Council had been suspended, following the case of Libya in 2011 during the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.[3][26] Speaking after the meeting, Kuzmin described the resolution as an \"illegitimate and politically motivated step\" and said that Russia had already withdrawn from the Council prior to the General Assembly vote.[25][27][28]","Title":"Eleventh emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16345","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_emergency_special_session_of_the_United_Nations_General_Assembly"}
