As technology allowed innovations and ideas to travel more quickly, the need to protect the ideas and innovations of its clients encouraged the firm to expand its international capabilities. In 2000 the firm opened offices in France and Sweden. One year later it opened in The Netherlands and the following year it opened its first office in Germany. In 2003, the expansion continued, with a new office in Italy and a second office in Germany.

The following year saw new offices in Madrid, Rome and Frankfurt, while 2006 saw a further opening in Lyon in France. 2008 saw the firm open a Finnish office in Helsinki through a merger with a leading Finnish firm Fennica, as well as four other offices in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and a third office in China with the opening of an office in Shanghai. On top of this, expansion in London continued through a merger with Lane & Partners. Bird & Bird continued to expand its international reach and in May 2013, merged with Danish outfit BvHD, completing its coverage of the Nordic region.
