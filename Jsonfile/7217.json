{"Content: ":"The Eurovision Song Contest 2023 is the upcoming 67th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It is set to take place in the United Kingdom, after Ukraine, winner of the 2022 contest with the song \"Stefania\" by Kalush Orchestra, was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on behalf of the Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (UA:PBC), the contest will consist of two semi-finals and a final in May 2023.[1] This will be a record-extending ninth time that the United Kingdom hosts the contest, having last done so in Birmingham in 1998. The 2022 contest was won by Ukraine with the song \"Stefania\" by Kalush Orchestra, and in accordance with Eurovision tradition, the EBU initially gave Ukraine the opportunity to organise the 2023 contest.[2][3] Ukraine had hosted the contest twice before, in 2005 and 2017, both times in Kyiv. However, in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, speculation was raised that the country would not be capable of hosting the event.[4] Due to this, several countries expressed interest in hosting in the event that Ukraine could not, including Belgium,[5] Italy,[6] the Netherlands,[7] Poland,[8] Spain (who later withdrew their interest),[9] Sweden,[10] and the United Kingdom.[11] The last time the contest was not held in the previous year's winning country was in 1980. On 16 May 2022, Mykola Chernotytskyi [uk], chairman of the Ukrainian participating broadcaster Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (UA:PBC), stated that they wish to host the contest in a peaceful Ukraine and hoped that the country would be able to guarantee the safety of all participants and their delegations during the event.[12] Chernotytskyi stated on 20 May that the broadcaster would begin discussions with the EBU regarding the hosting of the contest.[13][14] Numerous Ukrainian politicians advocated for the contest to take place in Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that he hoped for the contest to one day take place in Mariupol.[15] Mykola Povoroznyk, the first deputy head of the Kyiv City State Administration, stated on 26 May 2022 that Kyiv would be ready to host the contest if asked.[16] Ukrainian minister of culture Oleksandr Tkachenko stated on 3 June his intention to discuss conditional changes with the EBU in order to allow the contest to be held in the country.[17][18] Taras Melnychuk, representative of the Ukrainian government for the Verkhovna Rada, stated on 10 June that a committee was formed to aid the organisation of the contest.[19] On 16 June 2022, UA:PBC and the Ukrainian government held a meeting with the EBU to discuss potential hosting options in Ukraine.[20][21] At the meeting, UA:PBC proposed Lviv, Zakarpattia and Kyiv as potential host locations.[22] The following day, the EBU announced that Ukraine would not be able to host the contest, following assessments with both UA:PBC and third-party specialists, and that discussions would begin with the BBC for potentially hosting in the United Kingdom.[23] The United Kingdom had finished in second place in the 2022 contest with the song \"Space Man\" by Sam Ryder.[24] In response, UA:PBC chairman Chernotytskyi and Ukrainian minister of culture Tkachenko, alongside former Ukrainian Eurovision winners Ruslana, Jamala and Oleh Psiuk of Kalush Orchestra, issued a joint statement requesting further talks with the EBU on hosting the event in Ukraine.[25][26] This stance was supported by British prime minister Boris Johnson,[27][28] the Polish broadcaster TVP, Polish deputy prime minister and minister of culture Piotr Gli≈Ñski,[29] and British culture secretary Nadine Dorries.[30] A follow-up statement from the EBU on 23 June reaffirmed its decision to not host the event in Ukraine, highlighting the security considerations for doing so while also urging for the process of choosing the host country to not be politicised.[31] On 25 July 2022, the EBU, UA:PBC and the BBC announced that the 2023 contest would be held in the United Kingdom, with the host city bidding process to commence in the same week.[32][33] Following the announcement that Ukraine would not host the contest and prior to the United Kingdom being confirmed as the host country, a number of UK cities expressed interest in hosting: Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Newcastle, Sheffield, Sunderland, and Wolverhampton.[1][34][35] Public figures, including former UK Eurovision winners Lulu, Cheryl Baker of Bucks Fizz, and Katrina Leskanich of Katrina and the Waves, voiced their support for their respective favourite host cities.[36][37][38] Simultaneous with the confirmation that the UK would host the event, host broadcaster BBC launched the bidding process on 25 July 2022. In the first phase of this process, cities are to formally apply to bid.[33] The cities of Bristol, Glasgow and Sheffield officially announced their bids the following day.[39][40][41] They were followed by Birmingham on 27 July.[42] The following UK cities have expressed interest in hosting: The Eurovision Song Contest 2023 will be produced by the British public broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The Ukrainian public broadcaster, the Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (UA:PBC), will work with the BBC to develop and implement Ukrainian elements for the live shows.[61] The three shows will be produced by BBC Studios, the BBC's commercial subsidiary.[33] As of 19 July 2022,[update] the following 21 countries have publicly confirmed their intentions to participate in the 2023 contest: Twenty-six countries will participate in the final, composed of the previous edition's winner Ukraine, the \"Big Five\", and the ten best-ranked entries of each of the two semi-finals. All participating countries will vote in the final.[32] Eligibility for potential participation in the Eurovision Song Contest requires a national broadcaster with active EBU membership that would be able to broadcast the contest via the Eurovision network. The EBU regularly issues invitations of participation in the contest to all active members. Associate member Australia does not need an invitation for the 2023 contest, as it had previously been granted permission to participate at least until 2023.[90]","Title":"Eurovision Song Contest 2023 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7217","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2023"}
