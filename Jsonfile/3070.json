Hart's parents had four other children after Melissa: Trisha, Elizabeth, Brian, and Emily, who are all in acting. Her parents divorced in the early 1990s, and she moved with her mother and siblings to New York City. In 1994, her mother married television executive Leslie Gilliams, who is best known for his appearance on Season 5 of MasterChef in 2014, when he finished in 3rd place. Hart has three half-sisters: Alexandra, Samantha, and Mackenzie.[3] Hart was named after the Allman Brothers song \"Melissa\", while her middle name, Joan, came from her maternal grandmother. She chose Catherine as her confirmation name when she was in the eighth grade,[3] but does not use it professionally. Hart's career began at age four when she made a television commercial for a bathtub doll called Splashy.[3] From then on, she appeared regularly in commercials, making 25 of them before the age of five. Other early television work included a small role in the miniseries Kane & Abel in 1985, a guest-starring role in an episode of The Equalizer[5] in 1986, and a starring role alongside Katherine Helmond in the Emmy Award-winning TV movie Christmas Snow,[3] also in 1986.

Nevertheless, she was enthusiastic about the role, and \"all [she] hoped for that [she] would get to do it for a while.\"[11] Hart also recorded two albums as Clarissa: This Is What 'Na Na' Means[12] and a recording of Peter and the Wolf.[13] In 1995, a year after the end of Clarissa Explains It All, Hart filmed a pilot episode for a spin-off show featuring a college-aged Clarissa explaining it all about her foray into the professional world as an intern at a newspaper. As its musical theme, the show featured a slow, jazz version of its predecessor's theme song, and also starred Robert Klein as her boss.[14] Hart appeared on Nickelodeon's anthology show Are You Afraid of the Dark?, in the Season 2 episode \"The Tale of the Frozen Ghost\" (1993).[15] After the television series ended, Hart attended New York University.[16] However, she dropped out after she earned the title role for the 1996 TV film Sabrina the Teenage Witch,[17] which was followed by the television series of the same name, which lasted seven seasons on ABC and The WB.[18] She later collaborated on an animated version that featured Hart voicing the two aunts Hilda and Zelda, and Hart's younger sister Emily starring in the title role.

To capitalize on the song's success as a top-ten hit,[21] the name of the movie was changed to Drive Me Crazy. To promote the film, both Hart and Grenier appeared in the song's music video.[22] Around the same time, Spears made a guest appearance as herself on Sabrina, in the season four episode \"No Place Like Home\".[23] Coinciding with the release of Drive Me Crazy, Hart appeared wearing lingerie on the cover of Maxim magazine's October 1999 issue, as well as in a photo shoot and an accompanying article,[24] which resulted in an attempt by the publisher of the Sabrina comic book series to sue her for breach of contract.[25] Hart continued her acting career, starring in the film Rent Control,[26] which aired in 2005 on the ABC Family cable network. Hart also continued to star on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch until 2003.
