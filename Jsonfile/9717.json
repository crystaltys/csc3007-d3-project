{"Content: ":"The Southwest Region or South-West Region (French: Région du Sud-Ouest) is a region in Cameroon. Its capital is Buea.[2] As of 2015[update], its population was 1,553,320. Along with the Northwest Region, it is one of the two Anglophone (English-speaking) regions of Cameroon. Various Ambazonian nationalist and separatist factions regard the Sud-Ouest region as being distinct as a polity from Cameroon.[3] The region is divided into six divisions or departments: Fako, Koupé-Manengouba, Lebialem, Manyu, Meme, and Ndian. These are in turn broken down into subdivisions.[4] Presidentially appointed senior divisional officers (prefets) and subdivisional officers (sous-prefets) govern each respectively. Separatists from the Ambazonia administration regard both the Nord-Ouest (Northwest) and Sud-Ouest (Southwest) regions as being constituent components of their envisaged breakaway state.[5] The region was notable for having the first English-speaking university in Cameroon (the University of Buea). Towns include the capital Buea, Limbe, Tiko, Kumba and Mamfe. Limbe in particular is a popular tourist resort notable for its fine beaches. Korup National Park is also a major attraction. Buea itself, meanwhile, sits at the foot of Mount Cameroon, and possesses an almost temperate climate markedly different from the rest of the province.
