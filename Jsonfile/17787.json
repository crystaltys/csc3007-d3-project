{"Content: ":"Desmond's is a British television situation comedy broadcast by Channel 4 from 1989 to 1994.[1] Conceived and co-written by Trix Worrell, and produced by Charlie Hanson and Humphrey Barclay,[2] Desmond's stars Norman Beaton as barber Desmond Ambrose, whose shop is a gathering place for an assortment of local characters. The show is set in Peckham, London, and features a predominantly black British Guyanese cast. With 71 episodes, Desmond's became Channel 4's longest running sitcom in terms of episodes.[3] While the show was not the first black (or predominantly black) British television situation comedy (The Fosters, produced by London Weekend Television, aired 1976 \u201377),[4] Desmond's was the first to be set mainly in the workplace,[2] providing an insight into black family life different from what had been seen before on British television.[5] The characters had aspirations (Desmond to return to Guyana, Michael to run his own branch of the bank, Gloria to get a job in fashion, Sean to go to university) and were socially mobile.[2] The vast majority of the crew were also black.[6] Much of the success of the show came from the dynamics and relationships both within the Ambrose family and the other characters in the show who spent time in the shop.[5] The Ambroses are the central family around which the show was built. The series theme song \"Don't Scratch My Soca\", performed by Beaton was used in the opening credits throughout the entire run. A version without the vocals was used in the closing credits. At the beginning of Series 5, the theme received an update, with more percussion. The instrumental was used as the basis for a song by the \"Georgetown Dreamers\", Desmond's old band in one episode. The full theme was released as a 7\" single on June 21, 2021. Worrell was keen to show that prejudice existed not just between broad ethnic groups, but also within them.[2] While Matthew was the frequent butt of jokes from the West Indian characters, particularly Porkpie and Desmond, he was always keen to point out the strength of African history with his regular interjection, \"There's an old African saying...\".[5] The show had a unique method of team writing[2] raising the profile of some writers, such as playwright Michael J. Ellis, who later worked on other shows, including the BBC's all-black sketch show The Real McCoy, and Worrell himself who became a film writer. Re-runs aired in the USA on BET in the early 1990s. The show was shown on NYC Media as part of their Caribbean programming on Sunday nights in the late 1990s. As of January 2007, the network still airs re-runs of Desmond's from time to time. From 1997 until late 2000, Paramount Comedy re-ran the show. Trouble, a channel in the UK, began showing re-runs of Desmond's in September 2007. Desmond's was featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme Britain in a Box on 11 May 2013.[3] On 14 January 2013, The Africa Channel International (which was on Sky channel 209 & Virgin Media channel 828) relaunched Desmond's - weeknights at 7pm and 11pm.[7] In November 2015, London Live acquired the repeat rights. The full series was published for viewing on All 4 through YouTube. With 71 episodes, it remains Channel 4's longest running sitcom in terms of the number of episodes produced. The complete series was added to Netflix in September 2020. On 21 February 2022, Gold started showing the series. Channel 4 DVD has released the first two series on DVD in the UK. Series One was released on 1 October 2007. Series Two was released on 14 April 2008.[8] Visual Entertainment has begun releasing Desmond's on DVD in Canada. To date they have released the first four series of the show on DVD. Series 1 and 2 were released on 27 March 2007.[9] Series 3 was released on 3 November 2009.[10] On 2 March 2010, VEI released Desmond's- The Collection: Series One to Four, a seven-disc set featuring all episodes from the first four seasons.[11] All six seasons are available to stream in the UK on the Channel 4 service All 4 and through the streaming services Amazon Prime and Netflix. Following the death of Norman Beaton in 1994, a spin-off series was made with Porkpie in the title role. This ran for two series in 1995 and 1996.","Title":"Desmond's - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17787","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmonds"}
