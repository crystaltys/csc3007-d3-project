I didn\u2019t change my life until I approached everything like an addict. I haven\u2019t had sweets in almost three years because I know if I have one cookie, just like if an alcoholic has his first drink, I\u2019m off to the races and I\u2019m back eating sugar again.\"[46]","Title":"Jeff Garlin - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18529","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Garlin"}
