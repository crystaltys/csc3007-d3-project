{"Content: ":"Yixianopterus is a pterodactyloid pterosaur genus from the Barremian-Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning, China. It is known from a single specimen, holotype JZMP-V-12, housed at the Benxi Geological Museum. This specimen was doctored before acquisition, with much of the skull being fabricated.[1] LÃ¼ et al. (2006) assigned Yixianopterus to the lophocratian family Lonchodectidae on the basis of dental characters, classifying it as the first Asian representative of Lonchodectidae.[2] Martill (2011) considered it potentially related to his new taxon Unwindia,[3] and Witton (2013) assigned it to the family Ornithocheiridae.[4] A reappraisal of the holotype specimen and phylogenetic analysis by Jiang et al. (2020)[1] recovered Yixianopterus as a basal member of the clade Istiodactyliformes: Haopterus Linlongopterus Mimodactylus Yixianopterus Hongshanopterus Nurhachius Liaoxipterus Istiodactylus Ikrandraco Lonchodraco Ornithocheirus Cimoliopterus Anhangueria   ","Title":"Yixianopterus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"559","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixianopterus"}
