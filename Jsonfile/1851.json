{"Content: ":"The parietal eminence (parietal tuber, parietal tuberosity) is a convex, smooth eminence on the external surface of the parietal bone of the skull. It is the site where intramembranous ossification of the parietal bone begins during embryological development. It tends to be slightly more prominent in women than in men, so may be used to help to identify the sex of a skull.[1] Parietal eminence shown in red Skull showing parietal eminence as Tuber parietale This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 133 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)  This human musculoskeletal system article is a stub.
