In response, the Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced stated it was a team approach and that she supported Deseda in her role.[5] On the same day, a group of Puerto Rican scientists were circulating a document asking for Deseda's resignation saying she had shown a lack of competence in the past and was not up to the task of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico.[6] In late March 2020, Deseda announced her resignation. She stated she had missed prior COVID-19 related press conferences due to family medical issues. Her relationship with the acting Health Secretary, Concepción Quiñones de Longo was not as robust as with Rodríguez Mercado.[7]","Title":"Carmen Deseda - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11417","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Deseda"}
