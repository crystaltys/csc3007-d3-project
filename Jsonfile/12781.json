Karalasingham Kulendran (alias Master, Cholai) from Kilinochchi; Murugiah Thavaventhan (alias Vendran) from Kilinochchi; Chandrasekaralingam Vasudevan/Gnanasekaralingam Rajmathan (alias Mathan) from Trincomalee; and Velayanthan Vijayan from Mannar - were charged with possession of explosives and narcotics but the TID informed the magistrates court in Kilinochchi that there had been a plot to assassinate Sumanthiran.[28][32][33] The five suspects were bailed in September 2017 by the High Court in Jaffna .[34] The suspects weren't initially charged under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) but in July 2018 they were indicted under PTA regulations at the High Court in Colombo.[35][36][37] Sumanthiran was re-elected at the 2020 parliamentary election.[38][39][40] The preferential vote count held at Jaffna Central College on 6 August 2020 was marred by violent clashes between supporters of various candidates from various parties.[40] Relatives of TNA candidate Sashikala Raviraj (widow of Nadarajah Raviraj) accused Sumanthiran of interfering on the vote count.[41][42] However, the Center for Monitoring Election Violence, an independent election monitoring body who were present at the count, blamed the incident on lack of understanding of the counting process by candidates and their supporters combined with ability to spread unsubstantiated rumours on social media.[43] Sumanthiran denied the allegations, pointing out the counts were carried out and verified at different locations in each polling division, where counting agents for each candidate were present, before the results were brought to the primary counting centre at Jaffna Central College.[40][44][45] Sumanthiran is one of a trio of MPs (the other two being R. Sampanthan and Mavai Senathirajah) who lead the TNA.[46][47]","Title":"M. A. Sumanthiran - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12781","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Sumanthiran"}
