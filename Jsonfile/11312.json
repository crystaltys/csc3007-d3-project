{"Content: ":"The Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS; Malay: Taman Ekspo Pertanian Malaysia Serdang) is an agro park in Sepang District, Selangor, Malaysia. It is the largest agro park in Malaysia and Asia. It was created under an initiative by the Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture to be a venue for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE), especially for those catering towards the agriculture, horticulture and agrotourism field. MAEPS is situated to the south of the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute. It is accessible via the South Klang Valley Expressway.[citation needed] The convention centre has four halls (Halls A to D), which are situated on 368 acres (149 hectares) of land. The buildings and outdoor spaces were designed to bring out the best of the surrounding landscape.[1] The Malaysia Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism Show (MAHA) is held here once every two years. The last was held in 2018.[citation needed] During the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, MAEPS was converted into makeshift hospital to treat the infected patients. The hospital location is called the COVID-19 Quarantine and Low-Risk Treatment Centre.[2][3] MAEPS is expected to receive its first patient with low risk one week after its conversion process is complete.[4] It has started to operation since 23 April with 12 patients.[5] Coordinates: 2°58\u203247\u2033N 101°41\u203246\u2033E﻿ / ﻿2.9796515°N 101.6961694°E﻿ / 2.9796515; 101.6961694","Title":"Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11312","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Agro_Exposition_Park_Serdang"}
