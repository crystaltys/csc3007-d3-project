{"Content: ":"The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a light multiple rocket launcher developed in the late 1990s for the United States Army and mounted on a standard U.S. Army M1140 truck frame. The M142 carries one pod with either six GMLRS rockets or one ATACMS missile on the U.S. Army's new Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) five-ton truck, and can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions (MFOM). M142 ammunition pods are interchangeable with the M270 MLRS; however, it is able to carry only one pod rather than the standard two for the M270 and its variants. The launcher can be transported by Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft.[10] The chassis was initially produced by BAE Systems Mobility & Protection Systems (formerly Armor Holdings Aerospace and Defense Group Tactical Vehicle Systems Division), the original equipment manufacturer of the FMTV. It was produced by the Oshkosh Corporation from 2010 to 2017.[11] Both chassis and launcher system are now produced by Lockheed Martin Missiles & Fire Control in Camden, Arkansas.[12] The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a wheeled version of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The M142 mounts one pod, which is identical to the pods used by the M270. The windows of the launcher truck are made of glass and layers of sapphire.[13] M142 was also tested as a common launcher for both artillery rockets and the SLAMRAAM surface-launched variant of the AMRAAM anti-aircraft missile.[14] In October 2017, a Marine Corps M142 fired a rocket while at sea against a land target for the first time from the deck of the amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage, demonstrating the system's ability to operate while on ships to deliver precision fire from a standoff range against shore defenses.[15] The vehicle's targeting software was reworked so it can better fire while on a constantly moving and maneuvering launch platform.[16] On 14 February 2010, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan indicated in a press release that two rockets fired from a M142 unit were believed to have fallen 300 metres short of their intended target, killing 12 civilians during Operation Moshtarak. ISAF suspended the use of the M142 until a full review of the incident was completed.[17] A British officer later said that the rockets were on target, that the target was in use by the Taliban, and that use of the system had been reinstated.[18] Reports indicated that the civilian deaths were due to the Taliban's use of human shields; the presence of civilians at that location had not been known to the ISAF forces.[19] A report in the New York Times on 21 October 2010 credited the M142 with aiding the NATO offensive in Kandahar by targeting Taliban commanders' hideouts, forcing many to flee to Pakistan, at least temporarily.[20] In November 2015, the U.S. Army revealed that it had deployed the M142 to Iraq, firing at least 400 rockets at Islamic State (ISIL) targets since the beginning of that summer.[21] M142 detachments were sent to Al Asad Airbase and Al-Taqaddum Air Base in Al Anbar Governorate. On 4 March 2016, a U.S. Army M142 fired rockets into Syria for the first time in support of Syrian rebels fighting ISIL, from launchers based in neighboring Jordan.[22] In January 2016, Lockheed announced that the M142 had reached 1 million operational hours with U.S. forces, achieving a 99 percent operational readiness rate.[23] On 26 April 2016, it was announced that the U.S. would be deploying the M142 in Turkey near the border with Syria as part of the battle with ISIL.[24] In early September, international media and the U.S. State Department reported a newly deployed M142 had engaged ISIL targets in Syria near the Turkish border.[25][26][27] In October 2016, M142s were stationed at Qayyarah Airfield West, some 65 kilometres (40 mi) south of Mosul, taking part in the Battle of Mosul.[28] On 14 June 2017, a M142 was deployed at Al-Tanf, Syria, to support U.S.-backed rebels in the area.[29][30] On 24 May 2018, a M142 strike killed 50 Taliban fighters and leaders in Musa Qala, Afghanistan.[31] Three rockets struck the building within a 14-second timespan.[32] In September 2018, US support forces coordinated with Syrian Democratic Forces fighting to defeat ISIS in east Syria in the Deir ez-Zor campaign, sometimes striking ISIS positions with GMLRS rockets 30 times per day.[33][34][35][36][37] The M142 systems used in this support operation were located in the Omar oilfields, some 25 km (16 mi) north of the ISIS-controlled targets.[38] On 31 May 2022, the US announced that it would be supplying M142 launchers to Ukraine with M31 GMLRS unitary rockets.[39][40][41] The next day, it was reported that four units would be sent. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl said that the US would be able to send more systems as the fighting evolves.[42] On 23 June, the first HIMARS arrived in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.[43] On 25 June 2022, Ukraine started deploying the system against Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Ukraine's chief of General Staff, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, \"Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine hit ... military targets of the enemy on our, Ukrainian, territory\".[44] The Ukrainian military claimed that this first strike, on a Russian base in Izyum, killed over 40 soldiers. The same weapon system killed Russian Colonel Andrei Vasilyev, commander of an elite VDV paratrooper regiment.[45] The day before, a second batch of four was announced to be delivered in mid-July.[46] Russia said in June 2022 that the M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS were the most dangerous and capable weapons available to the Ukrainian armed forces, and that it was vital for Russian forces to wipe them out at source. A missile and artillery troops reserve officer in commentary for Russian state media claimed that the systems from the Russian viewpoint are the most dangerous and capable weapons available to the Ukrainian armed forces, and said that the munitions of these systems could be detected in flight and destroyed by advanced air defense systems that were being operated by Russia in Ukraine (such as the S-300, S-350, S-400, Buk, Tor-M2, Pantsir-S and Tunguska), if organized properly to strike rockets and missiles and with serious training. He said that it was unrealistic to jam GPS-guided missiles,[47] and others say that the rockets fly too fast and too low for Russian air defences to intercept them.[48] On 1 July, a US defense official told reporters that Ukraine had been using the system to destroy Russian command posts: \"selecting targets and then accurately hitting them ... degrading Russian capability\".[49] On 18 July, Zaluzhniy said: \"An important factor contributing to our retention of defensive lines and positions is the timely arrival of M142 HIMARS, which deliver surgical strikes on enemy control posts, ammunition and fuel storage depots.\"[50] Another four were announced for delivery on 8 July; the weeks-long process to train Ukrainian troops on how to use the platform is a limiting factor, which is why they are delivered in batches of four at a time. Ukraine is restricted by the US from firing HIMARS rockets into Russian territory to avoid escalating the conflict, but Russian forces within Ukraine are legitimate targets.[51] A fourth batch of four was announced on 20 July, bringing the total number of HIMARS committed to Ukraine to 16. Ukrainian Defense Minister Reznikov claims that the country needs \"at least 100\" of the systems; by that point, just 8 had destroyed 30 command stations and ammunition storage facilities, which dramatically decreased the intensity of Russian shelling and slowed their advance.[52] In that announcement, it was revealed that the number delivered had reached 12 launchers.[53][54][55] The M142 system can fire the following rockets and missiles: The M28 rockets are a variant of the unguided M26 rockets of the M270 system.[56] Each rocket pod contains 6 identical rockets. GMLRS rockets have an extended range and add GPS-aided guidance to their Inertial Navigation System. GMLRS rockets were introduced in 2005 and the M30 and M31 rockets are, except for their warheads, identical.[57] As of 1 December 2021[update] 50,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced,[58] with yearly production now exceeding 9,000 rockets. Each rocket pod contains 6 identical rockets. The Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a series of 610 mm surface-to-surface missile (SSM) with a range of up to 300 km (190 mi). Each rocket pod contains one ATACMS missile. As of 2022, only the M48, M57, and M57E1 remain in the US military's arsenal. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is a new series of GPS-guided missiles, which will begin to replace ATACMS missiles in 2024. PrSM carries a newly designed area-effects warhead and has a range of 60\u2013499 km (37\u2013310 mi). PrSM missiles can be launched from the M270A2 and the M142, with rockets pods containing 2 missiles. As of 2022 the PrSM is in low-rate initial production with 110 missiles being delivered to the US military over the year. PrSM will enter operational service in 2023.[70][57][71] Lockheed Martin UK and INSYS had jointly developed a demonstrator rocket artillery system similar to M142 for the British Army's \"Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapon System/Rocket\" (LIMAWS(R)) program. The system consisted of a single MLRS pod, mounted on a Supacat SPV600 chassis.[72] The LIMAWS(R) program was canceled in September 2007.[73] United States Army Romania Singapore United Arab Emirates Jordan Ukraine New Multiple Launch Rocket System. Program WR-300 \"Homar\" Poland. Multiple Launch Rocket System Cooperation between Huta Stalowa Wola, ZM Mesko and Lockheed Martin; 160 launchers are to be acquired, and to be mounted on a Jelcz 663 6Ã—6 chassis.[84][85] In October 2018, Poland officially requested the purchase of the rocket launchers, after the US Department of Defense cleared the purchase of up to 56 launchers in November 2017.[86][87] On 29 November 2018 the US State Department approved the sale to Poland.[88] Poland will acquire at least 20 M142 launchers.[89][90] On 26 May 2022, the Ministry of National Defence announced that it had sent an inquiry regarding the acquisition of another 500 M142 launchers.[91][92] The Pentagon reported that the Australian Army had asked to purchase 20 M142 launchers, with the sale being approved by the U.S. State Department on 26 May 2022.[93][94] On 21 October 2020, the US government approved the sale of 11 M142 launchers to Taiwan.[95][96] On 15 July 2022, United States approved the sale of six M142 Launchers to Estonia as part of package estimated at $500 million.[97] The Department of National Defence in 2009 considered the purchase of M142, but postponed the decision to \"possibly in the 2012 time frame\".[98][99][100][101] The Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania expressed the desire to jointly acquire the HIMARS capability.[102] In February 2022 Hungary announced that it was considering purchasing the M142 system, without stating how many.[103] The Netherlands have shown interest in the M142 system as one of several options to create a long-range artillery capability as part of improving the overall firepower of the Armed Forces as the MLRS system was phased out (2004) as part of cost savings.[citation needed] In December 2012, Qatar notified the U.S. of a possible Foreign Military Sale of seven M142 systems, as well as 60 M57 MGM-140 ATACMS Block 1A T2K unitary rockets and 30 M31A1 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) unitary rockets. The deal would cost an estimated US$406 million.[104] Sweden has shown interest in the M142 system as one of several options to create a long-range artillery capability. In October 2021, the system was involved in exercises on the Swedish island of Gotland.[105]","Title":"M142 HIMARS - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15994","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIMARS"}
