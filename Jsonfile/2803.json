{"Content: ":"The Sour Tour was the debut concert tour by American singer-songwriter and actress Olivia Rodrigo in support of her debut studio album, Sour (2021).[1] It began on April 5, 2022 in Portland, Oregon, with shows across North America and Europe. It concluded in London on July 7, comprising 48 shows.[2] Gracie Abrams, Holly Humberstone, Chappell Roan, and Baby Queen served as opening acts.[3] In July 2021, Billboard reported that the singer would be unable to embark on a tour until next year due to her television commitments and her contract with Disney.[4][5] An official concert cycle was announced through social media on December 6, with tickets going on sale four days later.[6] Tickets for the tour went on sale December 10 for fans who were chosen for \"Verified Fan\" registration.[7] Tickets sold out in minutes, although many attributed this to ticket scalpers, with some tickets being listed on secondhand sites for more than $9,000 within minutes of tickets going on sale.[8][9] Many fans and media outlets criticized the choosing of smaller venues over arenas, citing it as the reason many fans were unable to secure tickets.[10][11] Rodrigo defended her decision to perform at smaller venues, telling the Los Angeles Times \"I don\u2019t think I should skip any steps\" and assuring fans \"there will be more tours in the future.\"[12][13] This set list was representative of the show on April 5, 2022, in Portland. It was not representative of all concerts for the duration of the tour.[14]","Title":"Sour Tour - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2803","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_Tour"}
