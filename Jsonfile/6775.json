Since May 2018, it operates as a brand of Deutsche Bank's retail arm.[2] It serves 13 million customers in around 1,000 branches and 700 advisory centers.[3] The Postscheckdienst was introduced in 1909 by the German Reich establishing accounts for payment transactions by mail and linking postal and banking services in German states. In 1990, following the German Postal Services Restructuring Act (Poststrukturgesetz) of 1989, the German Postal Service (Deutsche Bundespost) was divided into three companies, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom and Postbank.

The first board of Postbank consisted of Günter Schneider, Rudolf Bauer and Bernhard Zurhorst. On 1 January 1995, following the new postal reform legislation (Gesetze zur Postreform II) of 1994, Postbank became an independent, joint stock company. Postbank then extended operations, and engaged in loans, insurance and homes savings. In 1999, Deutsche Post became the owner of Postbank. In that same year, Postbank acquired DSL Bank by the sale of the government's shares. Postbank subsidiary easytrade began offering on-line brokerage services in 2000.

On 1 January 2004 the postal bank took over the transaction banking of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. From then on Postbank executed the clearing and settlement of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank's payment transactions.[4] This agreement strengthened the bank\u2019s new business field \"Transaction Bank\" in the apron of the announced initial public offering.

In September 2008, 30% of Postbank was sold to Deutsche Bank for \u20ac2.8 billion.[5] In October 2010, Postbank put its Indian finance business up for sale.[6] Deutsche Bank gained a majority stake in the firm through a tender offer completed in December 2010,[7] and exercised its option[5] to acquire the remainder of Deutsche Post's holding in 2012.[7][8] In the end, the total purchase cost Deutsche Bank \u20ac6 billion.[9] Since May 2018, Postbank has been merged with the DB Privat- und Firmenkundenbank as a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank.
