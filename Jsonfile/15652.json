{"Content: ":"\"Where have you been for eight years?\", \"Where have you been for the last eight years?\",[a] or \"Why have you been silent during the past eight years?\"[b] is a phrase used during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in support of Russia, pointing out that the Russo-Ukrainian War has been ongoing since the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea.[1][2][3] It has been described as Russian pro-war propaganda.[1][4] Russian president Vladimir Putin's televised address on 24 February 2022 referenced the eight years that had passed since 2014 multiple times.[5] For eight years, for eight endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain.[c] ... The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.[d] Russian nationalists started using this phrase as their response to the \"#НетВойне\" (\"No to war\") hashtag, accusing anti-war protesters of having no concern for Russian people in the Donbass region of Ukraine. Later on, it was promoted by media celebrities within Russia, such as Nikolay Baskov, Tina Kandelaki, Masha Malinovskaya, and Dana Alexandrovna Borisova. According to social anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova, this argument is so common in Russian culture because it is much easier to point out the actions of an enemy instead of one's own actions, denying any form of guilt. It is also part of \"whataboutism\", which was a common tactic in Soviet propaganda, similar to \"And you are lynching Negroes\".[7] Ukrainian journalist and TV presenter Kateryna Osadcha said that \"Russia has been tearing Ukraine apart for eight years\".[8] On 3 March 2022, Pavlo Kanygin, a Russian journalist, wrote his responses[clarification needed] for the \"where have you been for eight years\" questions, which also explained more about the separatists at Donbass.[1]  This article related to politics in Russia is a stub.
