It also issues the Fryderyk annual award for Polish music. ZPAV was officially founded on July 11, 1991, following the recognition of the IFPI given in June of that year. In February 1995, ZPAV was authorized by the Polish Ministry of Culture to act as a rights management organization in the field of phonogram and videogram producers' rights. This was followed in December with the right to collect a share of the 3% blank media tax, in the name of the producers.[2] 1995 also marked the beginning of awarding music awards by ZPAV. The first gold and platinum awards were granted by ZPAV in February 1995. The Fryderyk annual award was presented for the first time in March.[2] In 1996, ZPAV started signing agreements about collecting commissions for the broadcasting of sound recordings. Agreements with Telewizja Polska and the main commercial radio stations were signed in 1997 and with Polskie Radio in 1999. Agreements with other commercial premises where music is played were signed starting in 2002. Commissions were first distributed to the producers in 1998.[2] In 1998, together with the Foundation for the Protection of Audiovisual Works (Polish: Fundacja Ochrony Twórczości Audiowizualnej, FOTA) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA), ZPAV found the Anti-Piracy Coalition.[3] In 2000, ZPAV published the first official Polish record chart, OLiS. Airplay monitoring starts when an agreement with Nielsen Music Control is signed in 2006.[2] ZPAV publishes two official album charts, OLiS, a weekly chart based on retail sales data,[4] and Top 100, a monthly chart based on data received from the album companies. It also publishes the Official Polish Airplay Chart, provided by Nielsen Music Control Airplay Services[5] and charts of songs most listened to in stores and discothèques. ZPAV certifies sales of albums, singles and videos, for media sold from 1993.[2] It awards Gold, Platinum and Diamond certifications, and as of 1 August 2021[update], the number of units required for certification is as follows:[6] Sales may include both physical units and digital sales.

The diamond award was first presented in July 2000 to Kayah i Bregović by Serbian musician Goran Bregović and Polish singer Kayah.[2] Prior to April 1997, the threshold for pop album was 100,000 units for gold, 200,000 for platinum and 1,000,000 for diamond award, with reduced thresholds (50,000/100,000/500,000) for international repertoire.[8] In April 1997,[8] the thresholds for domestic repertoire were reduced to the ones for international records, and the thresholds were set as follows:[9] Certifications was done by categories. It included a separate category for singles, up to 30 minutes (reduced to 20 minutes in 2014)[10] and no more than four songs, and maxi-singles, more than 30 minutes in length and between three and five songs.[9] Separate categories existed for multi-disc box sets and multi-disc video boxes. Originally, each media piece was counted separately,[11] but this practice was cancelled in February 2013.[12] It also included a separate video single category, for media with playing time of up to 15 minutes, which was genre-independent, with thresholds of 5,000/10,000/50,000.[9] The first change in the certifications occurred in June 2002.[8] Pop album thresholds were reduced to 35,000/70,000/350,000, and Class/Jazz to 5,000/10,000/50,000. A \"Soundtrack\" category was introduced, with thresholds of 10,000/20,000/100,000 and a separate genre-independent DVD category was added, with thresholds of 5,000 for Gold, 10,000 for Platinum and no Diamond award.[13] Reduced thresholds for foreign repertoire were introduced in June 2004.[8] The thresholds for foreign repertoire were set at 20,000/40,000/200,000 for Gold/Platinum/Diamond. At the same time, a classical-popular album category was introduced, with thresholds of 10,000/20,000/100,000.[14] In June 2006,[8] the thresholds for pop albums were reduced again, for the final time, as of 2021[update]. Domestic repertoire requirements were set to 15,000/30,000/150,000 and foreign repertoire were set to 10,000/20,000/100,000. However, this change was applied only for albums released from July 2005 onwards.[15][16] Following these change, the thresholds remained the same for a longer period, with changes only in the rules and categories of certifications. The DVD category was merged with the video category in January 2008.[17][18] Following this, digital sales for albums, including ringtones and mastertones, was recognized in September 2010,[11] with streaming included in April 2014.[10] In June 2015 the certification rules were greatly simplified.

Its status in the Polish public can be compared to the American Grammy and the UK's BRIT Award. The Fryderyk was established by ZPAV in 1994 and presented for the first time in 1995.[2] Since 1999, nominees and winners have been selected by the Phonographic Academy (Polish: Akademia Fonograficzna) which was founded by the General Assembly of ZPAV in 1998 and now consists of nearly 1000 artists, creators, journalists.[23] Since 2007 it is organized by STX Records.[2] Since 2010 ZPAV also awards a \"Digital Song of the Year\" award, which is awarded to the best selling digital song in two categories, Polish songs and foreign songs.
