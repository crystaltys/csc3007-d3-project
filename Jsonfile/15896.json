{"Content: ":"Oryx, or Oryxspioenkop, is a Dutch open-source intelligence defence analysis website,[1] and warfare research group.[2] It is run by Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans.[3] Both have previously worked for Netherlands-based Bellingcat.[4][5] Oryx was started in 2013, and initially focused on Syria.[6] Mitzer and Oliemans have also written a book on the Korean People's Army.[6] The blog gained international prominence through its work during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, counting and keeping track of material losses based on visual evidence and open-source intelligence (OSINT) from social media.[7][8][9] It has been regularly cited in major media, including Reuters,[10] BBC News,[11] The Guardian,[12] The Economist,[13] Newsweek,[14] CNN,[8] and CBS News.[15] Forbes has called Oryx \"the most reliable source in the conflict so far\", calling its services \"outstanding\".[16][17][18] Because it reports only visually confirmed losses, Oryx's tallies of equipment losses have formed absolute minimum baselines for loss estimates.[1][16]","Title":"Oryx (blog) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15896","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryxspioenkop"}
