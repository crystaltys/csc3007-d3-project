{"Content: ":"The Juno Award for International Album of the Year is an annual award given to a non-Canadian album. It has been given out since 1975. It was formerly known as Best Selling Album (Foreign or Domestic) (1993\u20132002), Best Selling Album by a Foreign Artist (1992), International Album of the Year (1981\u20131991), and Best Selling International Album (1975\u20131980). Thus, the rules have changed slightly over the years. (CÃ©line Dion, a Canadian won in 1999, 1997 & 1995 and Bryan Adams, also a Canadian won in 1993.) Presently, the nominees are based on sales (i.e. the five best-selling non-Canadian albums of the year), and therefore do not necessarily represent the year's \"best\" international albums. However, the ultimate winner of the award is determined by vote of the CARAS board of directors.[1]","Title":"Juno Award for International Album of the Year - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2980","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_Award_for_International_Album_of_the_Year"}
