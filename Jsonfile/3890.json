{"Content: ":"The Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. are a group of seventeen outdoor statues which are spread out through much of central and northwest Washington, D.C.[3] The statues depict 11 Union generals and formerly included one Confederate general, Albert Pike, who was depicted as a Mason and not as a general. The Pike statue was torn down on Juneteenth 2020, as part of the George Floyd protests.[4][5] Two Union admirals are honored, although Admiral Samuel Francis DuPont's statue was removed to Wilmington, Delaware, and he is now honored with a fountain. Other statues depict nuns, peace, emancipation, and the Grand Army of the Republic. In accordance with Executive Order 11593 by President Richard Nixon, the National Park Service surveyed and registered the 18 Civil War statues in Washington, D.C. to aid in their preservation.[6][7][8] They are listed as a group on the National Register of Historic Places.
