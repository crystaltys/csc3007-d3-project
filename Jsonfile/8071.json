{"Content: ":"Edotreotide (USAN, also known as (DOTA0-Phe1-Tyr3) octreotide, DOTA-TOC, DOTATOC) is a substance which, when bound to various radionuclides, is used in the treatment and diagnosis of certain types of cancer.[3] When used therapeutically it is an example of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. A phase I clinical trial of yttrium-90 labelled edotreotide concluded in 2011,[4] aiming to investigated effects in young cancer patients (up to 25 years of age). Specific cancers being included in the trial include neuroblastoma, childhood brain tumours and gastrointestinal cancer.[5] A phase II trial for the use of 90Y DOTA-TOC for patients with metastatic carcinoid, where octreotide treatment was no longer effective, also reported results in 2010.[6] Lutetium-177 labelled edotreotide (177Lu-DOTA-TOC), with the trade name Solucin, is the subject of a phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of GEP-NETs.[7][8] It was granted orphan drug designation by the European Medicines Agency in 2014.[9]  This pharmacology-related article is a stub.
