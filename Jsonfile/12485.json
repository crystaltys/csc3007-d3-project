[8] [9] [10] Andersen worked at the United Nations in New York for 12 years at the UN Sudano-Sahelian Office (UNSO), (now the Global Policy Centre on Resilient Ecosystems and Desertification based in Nairobi[11]) where she worked on drought and desertification issues.

It was opened by President Barack Obama on the eve of the formal opening [31] [32] During Andersen\u2019s tenure at IUCN she emphasized the importance of nature conservation in efforts to achieve sustainable development. \u201cNature is not an obstacle to human aspirations, but an essential partner, offering valuable contributions towards all our endeavours.\u201d [33] [34] On February 21 2019, the General Assembly of the United Nations elected Andersen as Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). She was appointed for a four-year term. [1]","Title":"Inger Andersen (environmentalist) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12485","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inger_Andersen_(environmentalist)"}
