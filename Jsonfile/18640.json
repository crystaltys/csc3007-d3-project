{"Content: ":"Love Is All There Is is a 1996 romantic comedy film written and directed by Joseph Bologna and Ren√©e Taylor, who also both star in the film. Love Is All There Is is a modern retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story, and it is set in the Bronx. The Capomezzos, Bronx-born Sicilians, own a local catering business. They develop a bitter rivalry with the pretentious Malacicis, recent immigrants from Florence and owners of a fine Italian restaurant. The Capomezzos' son, Rosario, falls in love with the Malacicis' daughter, Gina, after she replaces the star of the neighborhood church's staging of Romeo and Juliet. The rivalry intensifies after Rosario deflowers Gina after a fight with her parents. The movie was made in a few locations in New York: it was filmed at Greentree Country Club in New Rochelle, and many scenes were shot in City Island, Bronx.
