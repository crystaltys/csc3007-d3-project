He established himself as a key player at Arsenal in the following years. Smith Rowe represented England's youth teams at international level, and won the FIFA U-17 World Cup. He made his senior England debut in November 2021. Smith Rowe was born in Croydon, London.[2] He relocated to north London with his parents and brother when he was signed by Arsenal in 2010.[4] Smith Rowe joined Arsenal's Hale End Academy in 2010 at the age of ten, after playing for South London-based team Glebe.[5] He made his first appearance for the Under-23s in 2016\u201317, at the age of 16.

He is always full of energy and work rate, and come alive on the ball.\"[60] Mark Hudson, the former first-team coach at Huddersfield Town, was also impressed by Smith Rowe, \"He drifts past people. He does not look quick but he is and it is with the ball which is brilliant. He naturally glides across the ground and he takes the ball in his stride. He has good vision and a good understanding of the game.\"[61] Smith Rowe was involved in the Amazon Original sports docuseries All or Nothing: Arsenal, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021\u201322 season.[62][63] In one of his interviews, Smith Rowe revealed he is very close to his family. He talked about how much he appreciated the sacrifice his family made for him growing up.[64] His footballing idol is former Manchester United and England midfielder David Beckham, despite his playing style being compared to former Arsenal players Robert Pires and Alexander Hleb.[65][66] Arsenal England U17","Title":"Emile Smith Rowe - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19594","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Smith_Rowe"}
