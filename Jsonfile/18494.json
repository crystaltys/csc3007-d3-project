{"Content: ":"Stephen Clifford Patrick (n√© Patrebka, March 24, 1932 \u2013 January 11, 2014)[1] was a Canadian politician and athlete. Patrick was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1962 to 1977.[2] Patrick played with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers football team for thirteen years. He became President and General-Manager of Patrick Agencies Ltd. (now known as Patrick Reality Ltd.), and was a Director of the Winnipeg Real Estate Bld. and the Pioneer Fraternal Association.[1] He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1962, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative George Johnson[2] by 239 votes in the west-end Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1966 election, but retained his seat by only 26 votes over Tory Bill Docking in the 1969 election.[3] The once-dominant Manitoba Liberal Party was reduced to only five seats in the 1969 election, and dropped to four when Laurent Desjardins decided to support the New Democratic Party. Patrick was re-elected in 1973,[2] but lost his seat to Tory candidate Norma Price in the 1977 election, amid the Liberal Party's continued decline.[3] The son of Alexandre and Katie Patrebka, he was educated in Glenella, at the Manitoba Teachers College and at Success Community Business College. In 1956, he married Marjorie June Mathieson.[1] Patrick's sons, James and Steve, played in the National Hockey League (NHL). His grandson, Nolan Patrick, is currently playing in the NHL.[4] Patrick was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1988.[4] He died in 2014.[5]","Title":"Stephen Patrick - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18494","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Patrick"}
