{"Content: ":"The Regiment Special Force (RSF) is a Sri Lanka Air Forces elite special force unit, which is part of the SLAF Regiment. It was raised in 2006 and fought in the Sri Lankan Civil War. The RSF Wing is an independent formation of the SLAF and commanded by a Commanding Officer who is responsible to the Commander of the Air Force through Director Ground Operations for the efficient and effective function. The squadron was formed due to the Bandaranaike Airport attack by the LTTE.[citation needed]. Initially formed as Air Base Defence and Rescue Squadron on 7 July 2003 it was later renamed as Regiment Special Forces Wing in 2006. Most Air Bases are heavily built up due to availability of aircraft hangars and other related infrastructure. RSF skills on house clearance and close quarter fighting provides an added advantage for operating effectively with minimum collateral damage in Air Bases. SR by the RSF can be highly effective when conventional or tactical collection assets are unable to collect information of operational significance. The unit's personnel are trained in air base rescue operations, field craft, bomb disposal, fire fighting, water survival and rescue operations. Advanced training is carried out at the Sri Lanka Army Special Force training school at Maduruoya.
