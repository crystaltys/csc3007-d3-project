{"Content: ":"The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (aka Essential Medicines List for Children[1] or EMLc[1]), published by the World Health Organization (WHO), contains the medications considered to be most effective and safe in children up to twelve years of age to meet the most important needs in a health system.[2] The list is divided into core items and complementary items.[3] The core items are deemed to be the most cost-effective options for key health problems and are usable with little additional health care resources.[3] The complementary items either require additional infrastructure such as specially trained health care providers or diagnostic equipment or have a lower cost\u2013benefit ratio.[3] The first list for children was created in 2007, and the list is in its 7th edition as of 2019[update].[3][4] Note: An Î± indicates a medicine is only on the complementary list.[3] No listings in this section.
