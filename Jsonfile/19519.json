{"Content: ":"Luiz Fernando Carvalho (born July 28, 1960 in Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian filmmaker and television director, known for works closely linked to literature that constitute a renovation in Brazilian audiovisual aesthetics.[1] He has already brought to the screen works by Ariano Suassuna, Raduan Nassar, Machado de Assis, Eça de Queirós, Roland Barthes, Clarice Lispector, Milton Hatoum, José Lins do Rego and Graciliano Ramos, among others. Some critics compare Luiz Fernando Carvalho's productions to the Brazilian Cinema Novo[2] and icons of film history such as Luchino Visconti and Andrei Tarkovsky.[3] His work is characterized by visual and linguistic experimentation[4] and exploration of the multiplicity of Brazil's cultural identity.[5][6] The baroque style[7][8][9] of overlays and interlacing of narrative genres, the relation to the moment in Time,[10] the archetypal symbols of the Earth and the reflection on the language of social and family melodrama[11] are features of the director's poetic language. The filmmaker's works have met with both critical and public acclaim. He directed the film To the Left of the Father (Lavoura Arcaica) (2001),[12][13] based on the homonymous novel by Raduan Nassar, cited by the critic Jean-Philippe Tessé in the French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma as a \"ground-breaking promise of renovation, of an upheaval not seen in Brazilian cinema since Glauber Rocha,[14][15] which won over 50 national and international awards.[16] The telenovelas Renascer (Rebirth) (1993) and The King of the Cattle (O Rei do Gado) (1996), by screenwriter Benedito Ruy Barbosa and directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho, are recognized as benchmarks of Brazilian television drama and achieved some of the highest audience ratings of the 1990s.[17][18] There is a marked contrast between the director's television works: from the pop design of the 60s in the series Ladies' Mail (Correio Feminino) (2013) to the classic rigor of the mini-series The Maias (Os Maias) (2001), the urban references of the working-class suburbs in the mini-series Suburbia (2012) to the playfulness of the soap My Little Plot of Land (Meu Pedacinho de Chão) (2014), the aesthetic research of the Sertão (backcountry) in Old River (Velho Chico) (2016) to the Brazilian fairytale of the mini-series Today is Maria's Day (Hoje É Dia de Maria) (2005) and the realistic universe of family tragedy in Two Brothers (Dois Irmãos) (2017).[19][20] The director's production process is renowned for identifying new talent from all over Brazil and for training actors,[21] revealing new stars of the dramatic arts such as Letícia Sabatella, Eliane Giardini, Bruna Linzmeyer, Johnny Massaro, Irandhir Santos, Simone Spoladore, Caco Ciocler, Marcello Antony, Marco Ricca, Isabel Fillardis, Giselle Itié, Emilio Orciollo Netto, Sheron Menezes, Jackson Antunes, Maria Luísa Mendonça, Eduardo Moscovis, Jackson Costa, Leonardo Vieira, Cacá Carvalho, Luciana Braga, Julia Dalavia, Renato Góes, Cyria Coentro, Marina Nery, Júlio Machado, Bárbara Reis, Lee Taylor, Zezita de Matos, Mariene de Castro and Lucy Alves, among others. The director's actor coaching technique has given rise to a method recounted in the book O processo de criação dos atores de Dois Irmãos (The creation process of the actors in Dois Irmãos), by the photographer Leandro Pagliaro.[22][23] \"There is a concrete promise of renovation, of a palpitation not seen in Brazilian cinema since Glauber Rocha. (...) At first, one is left with nothing but fragments torn from a visual magma. But soon the chaos resolves itself, the film unrolls in all its richness like a barbaric poem verging on hallucination, of extraordinary power. (...) Never, however, does its return to the underlying myths obscure or accelerate the predominance of the sensations. If the film is possessed of such enchanting force, it is because Luiz Fernando Carvalho knows that everything starts there, in this first way of being born into the world, of allowing oneself to be ravished by it, to savor every twist of it...\" \u2014Les Cahiers du Cinèma, by Jean-Philippe Tessé on his critic about To the Left of the Father (Lavoura Arcaica)[14] Luiz Fernando Carvalho studied architecture and literature. He started out in cinema at 18 in a number of roles: audio technician, assistant director, screenwriter, short film editor, and director. His first TV work came in the early 80s, as assistant director of noteworthy mini-series, such as O Tempo e o Vento, based on the work of Érico Veríssimo, directed by Paulo José, and Grande Sertão: Veredas, from the work of João Guimarães Rosa, in which he started to direct his first scenes, still as assistant director to Walter Avancini. He wrote and directed the short The Waiting (A Espera), based on the book A Lover's Discourse: Fragments (Fragments d'un discours amoureux) by Roland Barthes. Launched in 1986, the film collected the following awards: Best Short Film, Best Actress (Marieta Severo) and Best Cinematography (Walter Carvalho) at the 13th Festival de Gramado;[24] Best Short Film (Golden Shell) at the San Sebastián International Film Festival (Spain); and the Special Jury Award at the Ste Therèse Festival (Canada). Early in the 90s, Luiz Fernando Carvalho directed a 40-chapter mini-series written by Aguinaldo Silva, based on the work of José Lins do Rego and starring Vera Fischer, Osmar Prado, Sebastião Vasconcelos, Carlos Alberto Riccelli and Fernanda Montenegro, with costumes by Beth Filipecki. The then inhospitable island of Fernando de Noronha (PE) served as the scene for the story, which is set in a small fishing village in the Northeast of Brazil. In 1991, Luiz Fernando Carvalho directed an adaptation of a script by Brazilian TV pioneer Péricles Leal, with costumes by Beth Filipecki. The telefilm was shot in the town of Canindé, Ceará, and reached the finals of the 34th New York Television Festival. This marked the television debut of actress Letícia Sabatella. The critic Rodrigo Fonseca affirmed that his first memory of Letícia Sabatella on TV was also when he discovered the existence of the \"genius of direction that is Luiz Fernando\".[25] In 1992, he directed the telenovela written by Aguinaldo Silva, considered to have reached the 6th largest audience in Brazilian television history.[26] Notable cast members included: Lima Duarte, Renata Sorrah, Armando Bógus, Eva Wilma, Paulo Betti, Andréa Beltrão, Pedro Paulo Rangel and Eduardo Moscovis. Certain characters are regarded as landmarks in TV drama: Sergio Cabeleira (Osmar Prado) and the photographer Jorge Tadeu (Fábio Jr.). While filming Pedra sobre Pedra, Luiz Fernando Carvalho came up with a significant sequence inspired by Ariano Suassuna's Armorial Movement (Movimento Armorial) . The enormous success of the sequence, confirmed by the record number of requests by viewers for a rerun, was decisive in the transformation of the material into a telefilm, with additional scenes written by Braulio Tavares and interpreted by the actor and musician Antonio Nóbrega. It competed for the International Emmy Award in 1993.[27] The 1993 soap, written by Benedito Ruy Barbosa and directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho, met with critical and public acclaim and was the most-watched in the 90s and 4th in audience ratings in the history of Brazilian television.[26] It was also shown in several other countries. As directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho, it is regarded as among the symbols of renovation of the aesthetics of the genre in the 90s.[28] The character Buba, interpreted by Maria Luísa Mendonça, caused a national controversy, as it was the first time that the discussion of gender had been addressed in a telenovela. It received the APCA Award for Best Novela, Best Actor (Antônio Fagundes), Best Supporting Actor (Osmar Prado), Best Supporting Actress (Regina Dourado), Best Male Breakthrough Performance (Jackson Antunes).[29] Leonardo Vieira, Jackson Antunes, Cacá Carvalho, Marco Ricca, Isabel Fillardis and Maria Luísa Mendonça were among the talents revealed in this work. The television entrepreneur José Bonifácio de Oliveira, considered the plot \"well structured by Benedito, with a well-crafted first part, masterfully directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho\".[30] According to Marilia Martins, few novelas had a first chapter directed with such polish and skill as Rebirth. In 1994, the telefilm directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho marked the first appearance of Ariano Suassuna's works on television.[31] Based on the writer's unpublished novel of the same name, the script was the work of Ariano himself, in partnership with the director. Director of photography Dib Lufti, costumes by Luciana Buarque, and art production by Lia Renha. Scenography by the artist Fernando Velloso, from the Grupo Corpo dance group, music by Antônio Madureira, a member of the Armorial Quintet (Quinteto Armorial). With A Woman dressed in Sun (Uma Mulher Vestida de Sol), the director commenced his exploration of the limits of television language, combining elements of the popular theater of the Northeast. Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos's Grupo Piolim participated and the cast included Tereza Seiblitz, Lineu Dias, Sebastião Vasconcelos, Ana Lúcia Torre, Raul Cortez and the then novice actor Floriano Peixoto. According to the researcher of Literature Hélio Guimarães, the work gave rise to an impasse at the TV station: was Luíz Fernando Carvalho too big for the Globo screen?[32] One year after A Woman dressed in Sun (Uma Mulher Vestida de Sol), in 1995, Luiz Fernando Carvalho resumed his connection with the writer Ariano Suassuna, this time transforming the play The Farce of Pleasant Idleness (A Farsa da Boa Preguiça) into a telefilm . The director continued his search for a hybrid language for television, as a way of criticizing the naturalism of the novelas. Art production and costumes by Yurika Yamasaki and the artist Dantas Suassuna, participation of Antonio Nóbrega, Patrícia França, Ary Fontoura and Marieta Severo. According to the critic Rogério Durst, the telefilm was a major feat of TV drama.[33] The King of the Cattle (O Rei do Gado), 1996, the director's next collaboration with the author Benedito Ruy Barbosa,[34] became the novela with the 9th largest audience in Brazilian television history.[26] It was rescreened three times,[35][36] outrating other productions of the time, and was sold to over 30 countries. It marked the debut of Marcello Antony, Caco Ciocler, Mariana Lima, Emilio Orciollo Netto and Lavínia Vlasak.[37] Other significant aspects of the novela were its social criticism and sensitive approach to the Landless Workers Movement (movimento dos sem-terra).[38] The actors Jackson Antunes and Ana Beatriz Nogueira stand out in this context. The cast included Antônio Fagundes, Patricia Pillar, Leticia Spiller and Raul Cortez with guest appearances in the early stages by Tarcisio Meira, Eva Wilma and Vera Fischer. The character Tião Galinha, interpreted by Osmar Prado, is a landmark of his career. The novela received the Certificate of Merit at the San Francisco International Film Festival and the APCA Award for Best Actor (Raul Cortez), Best Supporting Actor (Leonardo Brício), Best Supporting Actress (Walderez de Barros) and Best Male Breakthrough Performance (Caco Ciocler).[39] Fernando de Barros e Silva wrote, in the Folha de S.Paulo, \"The King of the Cattle (O Rei do Gado) swallows up Brazilian cinema\".[40] According to critic Rogerio Durst, the novela is \"a dramatic epic with first class special appearances and superb photography\". Tiao Galinha belongs to another soap opera: \u201cRenascer\u201d. The quality of the first seven chapters of The King of the Cattle (O Rei do Gado), showing the decline of the coffee cycle and Brazil's participation in World War II, prompted The Globo Network's International Division to transform the first part of the novela into the mini-series Giovanna and Henrico, with Letícia Spiller and Leonardo Brício playing the lead couple. The production was selected as hors-concours at the Banff World Media Festival, in Canada.[41] Before the end of the 90s, Luiz Fernando Carvalho had already started on research for the feature film To the Left of The Father (Lavoura Arcaica). Together with the author of the novel, Raduan Nassar, he traveled to Lebanon to familiarize himself with Mediterranean culture. The material collected during the trip was used to produce the documentary May your eyes be blessed (Que Teus Olhos Sejam Atendidos), screened on GNT in 1997.[42] In the opinion of critic Rodrigo Fonseca, the documentary \"honed to the limit of tragic fatality its investigation of time\". In 2001, the director made his first feature film, To the Left of the Father (Lavoura Arcaica), in which he was responsible for directing, screenplay and editing, with cinematography by Walter Carvalho, art direction by Yurika Yamazaki and costume design by Beth Filipecki.[2][3][43] The cast included Selton Mello, Raul Cortez, Simone Spoladore, Leonardo Medeiros, Caio Blat and Juliana Carneiro da Cunha. Aiming to maintain the connection with the poetic prose of Raduan Nassar's book, the director elected to film without a defined script, based entirely on the actors' improvisations on the theme.[10][8][11] This involved intensive coaching of the cast, secluded on a farm for four months.[44] The film's creation and production process was discussed in the book About To the Left of The Father (\"Sobre Lavoura Arcaica\"), in which the director is interviewed by José Carlos Avellar, Geraldo Sarno, Miguel Pereira, Ivana Bentes, Arnaldo Carrilho and Liliane Heynemann, launched in Portuguese, English and French by the publisher Ateliê Editorial.[45] It was success with the critics[46][47][48][49] and the public, reaching 300 thousand viewers with just two copies, one in Rio de Janeiro and the other in São Paulo. It is considered one of the 100 best Brazilian films of all times, according to the Brazilian Film Critics Association (Abraccine).[50] It had a successful career in a number of national and international festivals, receiving over 50 awards at the Montreal World Film Festival,[16][51] the Rio Film Festival, the São Paulo International Film Festival, the Grand Prix for Brazilian Film, the Brasília Film Festival,[52] the Havana Film Festival,[53] the Cartagena Film Festival,[54] the Guadalajara International Film Festival, the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema,[55] among others. In the opinion of writer and psychoanalyst Renato Tardivo, author of Porvir que vem antes de tudo \u2013 literatura e cinema em Lavoura Arcaica, the film is one of the most important works of Brazilian cinema \u201cof all times\u201d.[56] The critic Carlos Alberto de Mattos described it as the first work of art of the Brazilian cinema in the 21st century.[57] The film was acclaimed by the critics of various countries and, according to the French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, To the Left of the Father is a \"barbarous poem verging on hallucination, of extraordinary power\".[58][59][60] A 2001 production, this mini-series based on the homonymous novel by Eça de Queirós and adapted by Maria Adelaide Amaral was another landmark in the director's career.[61] The Maias portrays the decadent Portuguese aristocracy in the second half of the 19th century, through the tragic story of a traditional Lisbon family. Costumes by Beth Filipecki and direction of photography by José Tadeu Ribeiro. In the opinion of writer Luis Fernando Veríssimo, \"the extraordinarily mobile camera of Luiz Fernando Carvalho \u201cvisited\u201d, more than portrayed, the frivolous Lisbon of the time and all the novel's atmospheres. But beneath it all, there was this majestic progression, from the first scene to the denouement, the moving camera conducting us like a slow tragic theme tune that recalls a symphony. No TV camera has ever been so complicit and seductive, never has TV been so romantic\".[62][63] Over two seasons, Today is Maria's Day (Hoje É Dia de Maria) (2005), a mini-series in which he was also responsible for creation and script, consolidated the director's linguistic research.[64] His co-writers were Luis Alberto de Abreu and Carlos Alberto Soffredini, basing themselves on a selection of stories taken from popular Brazilian oral storytelling tradition,[65] collected by the writers Câmara Cascudo, Mário de Andrade and Sílvio Romero. Art direction by Lia Renha, guest artist Raimundo Rodriguez, direction of photography by José Tadeu Ribeiro and costumes by Luciana Buarque. The 60 marionettes that represented the animals were produced by the Grupo Giramundo, from Minas Gerais state. The work marked the start of the partnership between the director and psychoanalyst Carlos Byington, as advisor on the mythological dramatization of the text. The mini-series was conceived under a 360º dome, scrap from a rock show stage. The sound track, by Tim Rescala, was based on cirandas (traditional dances) by Heitor Villa-Lobos, César Guerra-Peixe and Francisco Mignone. Designer Jum Nakao was responsible for some of the costumes, with animation of the stop-motion scenes by Cesar Coelho, founder of the Anima Mundi festival.

Compared with To the Left of the Father on account of its innovative television language, it caught the attention of critics and public by its novel, theatrical and playful language in transporting the universe of popular culture to a sophisticated television production, without losing its authenticity.[67] The critic Nilson Xavier considers it one of the most poetic, original and beautiful productions of recent years.[68] According to Jean-Philippe Tessé, in the French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, the mini-series was very ambitious and formally very well produced, following other noteworthy projects such as The Maias (Os Maias). In 2007, the director's third production based on the works of Ariano Suassuna brought to the TV the Romance d'A Pedra do Reino e o Príncipe do Sangue do Vai-e-Volta. The mini-series is regarded as yet another aesthetic innovation by the director, as in To the Left of the Father (Lavoura Arcaica) and Today is Maria's Day (Hoje é Dia de Maria).

Ariano Suassuna affirmed that Luiz Fernando Carvalho's recreation of his Romance d\u2019A Pedra do Reino resulted in an \"extraordinarily beautiful work that moved him as author and individual, as a spectator\".[69][70][71][72][73] Based on Stone of the Kingdom (A Pedra do Reino) (2007), the director set up the Quadrante Project with the intention of making a series of regional drama programs to rediscover the Brazilian imaginary through adaptations of literary texts of authors from each Brazilian state.[74] Similarly, local actors act out the texts. The richness of the project lay in the discovery of regional talent: authors, actors, composers, artists in general. The project recognized the human potential of each regional culture, looking beyond the simplistic image of a postcard. In addition to Stone of the Kingdom, the Quadrante is made up of the mini-series Capitu (2008), based on the book Dom Casmurro, by Machado de Assis, and Dois Irmãos (2017), by Milton Hatoum.[75] In 2008, Luiz Fernando Carvalho directed and finalized the script for this adaptation of the book Dom Casmurro, by Machado de Assis.[76] The mini-series was written by Euclydes Marinho in collaboration with Daniel Piza, Luis Alberto de Abreu and Edna Palatnik.

In the opinion of critic Gustavo Bernardo, the mini-series deserves \"to be viewed and reviewed countless times, at least because each fragment of a scene is precious for its beauty\".[78] According to theatre director Gabriel Villela, Luiz Fernando Carvalho produces works of art on the screen, calls on the viewer's vivacity so that he accepts nothing masticated, but masticates along with Casmurro.[79] For Randall Johnson, director of the UCLA Latin American Institute, \"Luiz Fernando Carvalho is today, without doubt, the director whose work is the most authorial of all TV and cinema production in Brazil\".[80][81] In 2010, Luiz Fernando Carvalho created, directed and wrote the mini-series inspired by Sigmund Freud's: famous question \"What does a woman want?\".

In 2012, the Globo network took the series up again for a second season in 2013 due to its satisfactory audience ratings.

The critic Cristina Padiglione regards the novela as worthy of a standing ovation, and in the opinion of Alexandra Moraes \"the images, at first sight childish, gain relevance with colors and effects of dramatic intent. Good performances and the firm hand of the director give the plot meaning\".[111][112] In 2016, Old River (Velho Chico) marked Luiz Fernando Carvalho's return to prime time,[113] directing the novela written by Benedito Ruy Barbosa and Bruno Luperi, which again carried the imprint of the new esthetic in TV drama.[114][115] The novela was divided into two phases,[116] with direction of photography by Alexandre Fructuoso and costumes by Thanara Schönardie.

The character was maintained in the plot even after the actor's death through the language created by Luiz Fernando Carvalho, in which a single subjective camera interpreted Santo's viewpoint, so his presence was felt, engaging with all the other characters, to the end.[131][132][133] The novela came under strong pressure from the Globo network's drama department, calling for modifications to the text, storyline and esthetics.
