His son Richard O'Neil Burrell is an American rapper known as Robb Banks.[5] In 2022, he received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Brown University.[2] Shaggy enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1988 and obtained the MOS of 0811 (Field Artillery Cannon Crewman). He served with a Field Artillery Battery in the 10th Marine Regiment during the Persian Gulf War. The highest rank he achieved was lance corporal, although he was reduced in rank twice.[6] Shaggy perfected his signature singing voice while he was in the Marine Corps.[7][8] Shaggy decided to pursue his music career and his first hit in 1993, \"Oh Carolina\", was a dancehall re-make of a ska hit by the Folkes Brothers, which appeared in the film Sliver.[1] The same year, Shaggy appeared on Kenny Dope's hip hop album The Unreleased Project. He worked together with producers such as Sting International, Don One, Lloyd 'Spiderman' Campbell, Robert Livingston and Frankie Cutlass on the Maxi-Single title \"Nice and Lovely\" Hip Hop Remix. He had further big hits, including \"Boombastic\" in 1995,[1] the theme tune of a popular Levi's commercial, and sang with Maxi Priest on his Top 20 hit from 1996, \"That Girl\".[9] In 1999, Shaggy was dropped by Virgin, who felt he was unlikely to release another song as successful as 1995's \"Boombastic\".[10] He would sign with DreamWorks to release the album Hot Shot, the following year. The album featured the smash hit singles \"It Wasn't Me\" and \"Angel\", the latter of which was built around two song samples \u2013 Chip Taylor's song \"Angel of the Morning\" (which released by Merrilee Rush in 1968 and covered in 1981 by Juice Newton), and The Steve Miller Band's 1973 hit \"The Joker\". Both songs topped the Billboard Hot 100 and saw similar success worldwide, reaching number one in the UK, Ireland, Scotland and France, among others.[1] Female artist Lady Saw (aka Marion Hall) did an answer record to It Wasn't Me (\"Son of a Bit@h\") that also saw chart action.
