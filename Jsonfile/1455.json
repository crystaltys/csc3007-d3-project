{"Content: ":"Nochelaspis is an extinct genus of Galeaspid.[1] It lived during the Lochkovian period in Lower Devonian East Asia (in today southeastern China[2][3] and northern Vietnam[4]). Nochelaspis is the largest Eugaleaspid so far described. It is known from a head plate that was 127 mm (5.0 in) long, 158.5 mm (6.24 in) wide and 0.8 cm (0.3 in) thick. It is an element of the Early Vertebrate fauna in the Xishancun Formation, and lived among Polybranchiaspids, Paleoniscoids, Crossopterygians, Arthrodires, Antiarchs, and Petalichthyids.[1]  This article about a prehistoric jawless fish is a stub.
