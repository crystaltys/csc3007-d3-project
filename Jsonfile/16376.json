{"Content: ":"peacenotwar is a piece of malware created by Brandon Nozaki Miller. In March 2022, it was added as a dependency in an update for node-ipc, a common JavaScript dependency. Between 7 March and 8 March 2022, Brandon Nozaki Miller, the maintainer of the node-ipc package on the npm package registry, released two updates containing malicious code targeting systems in Russia and Belarus (CVE- 2022-23812).[1][2] A week later, Miller added the peacenotwar module as a dependency to node-ipc.[3] The function of peacenotwar was to create a text file titled WITH-LOVE-FROM-AMERICA.txt on the desktop of affected machines, containing a message in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Because node-ipc was a common software dependency, it compromised several other projects which relied upon it.[4] Among the affected projects known was Vue.js, which required node-ipc as a dependency but didn't specify a version. Some users of Vue.js become affected if the dependency was fetched from specific packages. Unity Hub 3.1 was also affected, but a patch was issued the same day as the release.[5][6]","Title":"peacenotwar - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16376","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacenotwar"}
