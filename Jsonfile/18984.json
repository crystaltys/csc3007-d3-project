{"Content: ":"a Lowercase \"d\" per here. This is a list of Members of the United Kingdom House of Lords who were born, live or lived in Northern Ireland. This list does not include hereditary peers whose only parliamentary service was in the House of Lords prior to the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, and who lost their seats under that Act. Nor does it include those in the Peerage of Ireland, who have never had an automatic right to a seat in the House of Lords at Westminster.[a] There is no such thing as the Peerage of Northern Ireland and peers do not represent geographic areas as such.[b] Some do, however, choose titles which reflect geographical localities, e.g. Lord Kilclooney; this is, however, entirely nominal.","Title":"List of Northern Ireland members of the House of Lords - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18984","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Northern_Ireland_Members_of_the_House_of_Lords"}
