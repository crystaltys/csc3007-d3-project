{"Content: ":"The Mercedes-Benz G500 4×4² (or G550 4×4² in the United States) is a special edition of the W-463 Mercedes-Benz G-Class (1990\u20132018), built with portal gear axles and much larger wheels and tires, for greatly increased off-road capability. In production since 2015, the model combines the body of a regular long-wheelbase Mercedes G-wagen with the portal axles with hub gearing of the much larger Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG 6x6.[1] In addition to the greatly increased ground clearance, the G500 4×4² version also has significantly wider tracks, compared to regular G-Class models.[2] Fitted with a twin-turbo V8 engine with up to 416 HP, the vehicle stands out by combining Humvee-like off-road specifications with sportscar performance, as well as being one of the very few production cars equipped with portal axles / geared hubs.  Mercedes-Benz initially showed the G500 4×4² to the public as a concept car, called \"Extreme-G\". One reason the concept was developed was due to the high demand for the G-Class \u2014 in 2014 the G-Class sold over 14,000 units, which is a lot for such an expensive type of vehicle, and with high profit margins to boot. As a result, a considerable budget for low-volume derivatives was authorized.[2] Positive response to this show car helped endorse the development of a series production version.[3] The car was launched at the Geneva motor show and brought into production in 2015 [4][5][6][7] Though initially not available, the car was introduced to the U.S. market as a 2017 model \u2013 called the G550 4x4² \u2013 at an introduction price around $200,000.[8] In spite of the difference in designation, it has the same drivetrain as the global version. The Mercedes-Benz G500 4×4² has a 4.0 l (244 cu in) twin-turbo V8 petrol engine producing 416 bhp and 450 lb⋅ft (610 N⋅m) of torque, a seven-speed automatic transmission, and three lockable differentials, like any regular G-Wagen.[8] The special axles and wheels are complemented by suspension with dual spring and shock damper struts with adjustable damping, on all corners.[9] The car features very aggressive styling, that uses the front fascia copied from the G63 and G65 AMG, and dual side-pipe exhausts that exit ahead of the rear wheels on both flanks.[2] The vehicle's ground clearance of 410 mm (16.1 in) slightly betters that of a Humvee, but it can sprint from naught to 60 mph (97 km/h) in less than six seconds.[8] On the inside, the car offers comfort and materials similar to a luxury saloon. Compared to the already very robust standard G550, the 4×4² still offers much more of every off-road specification: 7.9 in (20 cm) of extra ground-clearance, 15.8 in (40 cm) of additional wading depth, a 21.6-degree steeper approach-angle, 23.4 degrees greater breakover-, and 13.4 extra degrees departure-angle.[8] The front track is wider by 9 inches (23 centimetres), the rear by 10 inches (25 centimetres). The Mercedes 4×4² beats the Hummer H1 on paper in almost every off-road measurement \u2014 except for traversing a slope. The 4×4² is limited to a 28.4 degrees bank-angle, compared with the Humvee\u2019s 30°.[8]","Title":"Mercedes-Benz G500 4×4² - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12776","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_G500_4%C3%974%C2%B2"}
