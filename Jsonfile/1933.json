It is the superior origin of the pterygomandibular raphe, and the levator veli palatini muscle. The pterygoid hamulus is part of the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone of the skull. Its tip is rounded off.[1] It has an average length of 7.2 mm, an average depth of 1.4 mm, and an average width of 2.3 mm.[1] The tendon of tensor veli palatini muscle glides around it.[1] The pterygoid hamulus is the superior origin of the pterygomandibular raphe. It is also the origin of levator veli palatini muscle.[1] Rarely, the pterygoid hamulus may be enlarged, which may cause mouth pain.[2] This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 151 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)","Title":"Pterygoid hamulus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1933","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygoid_hamulus"}
