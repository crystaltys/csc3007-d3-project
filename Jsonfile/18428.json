{"Content: ":"The 1960 CFL season is considered to be the seventh season in modern-day Canadian football, although it is officially the third Canadian Football League season. The IRFU changed its name to become the Eastern Football Conference. The CFL allowed unlimited blocking on interception returns. The Calgary Stampeders moved into McMahon Stadium on Monday, August 15, after it took only 103 days to be built. On September 14, four of the six directors of the Montreal Alouettes abruptly resigned their positions. The resignations of Lucien Beauregard, Morgan N. Johnston, David C. McConnell and W. Heard Wert left only owner-president Ted Workman and general manager-coach Perry Moss on the board. Rosters were reduced from 40 players to 34 on September 15. Ottawa's Ron Stewart rushed for 287 yards on 16 carries in a game in Montreal against the Alouettes on Monday, October 10. He rushed for four touchdowns, one in each quarter, on runs of 39, 51, 51 and 37 yards. He broke the single-game record of 217 yards held previously by Hamilton's Gerry McDougall. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers honoured their 11-year veteran guard with \"Buddy Tinsley Night\" at half-time during their Thursday, October 13, 1960, game versus the BC Lions. The Winnipeg crowd of 16,773 was delighted when Tinsley lined up at fullback and took a hand-off from quarterback Kenny Ploen over from the BC one-yard line for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. At league meetings during Grey Cup week, Western teams dropped their insistence on sharing in the lucrative television rights payments received by the Big Four (Eastern) teams as a condition of accepting an interlocking schedule. It was agreed to begin a partially interlocking schedule in 1961, with travel costs to be offset by an across-the-board surcharge of 25 cents on the price of every ticket sold (each team, every seat, every game). The CFL played an unbalanced schedule of Exhibition games. Four teams (Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg and Hamilton) played their annual split-squad scrimmages at the conclusion of their preliminary training camps. 25 players received skin burns during an Edmonton\u2013Calgary game played at Mewata Stadium in Calgary on July 20. Two Eskimos, Roger Nelson and Jim Shipka, were treated in a Calgary hospital. Two Stampeders, Doug Brown and Ernest Warlick, filed damage claims with the City of Calgary. The lime used for field markings initially was suspected as being the cause, although laboratory tests later determined it was fully hydrated and should not have been the culprit. Fertilizer also was suggested as a possible cause of the skin burns. On July 28, the Saskatchewan Roughriders played the London Lords of the Senior Ontario Rugby Football Union in London, Ontario, and beat their hosts 38\u20130. On July 29, the BC Lions played the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Part of the local appeal was the presence on three former University of Iowa stars, Kenny Ploen and Ray Jauch of the Blue Bombers, and Willie Fleming of the BC Lions. After playing (and losing to) the NFL Chicago Cardinals in 1959, the Toronto Argonauts hosted the NFL Pittsburgh Steelers at CNE Stadium on August 3 and lost 43\u201316. Both teams used 12 players, with a handful of NFL rules (blocking, punt returns) blended into the Canadian game. Toronto also played host to an NFL exhibition game between the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants, at Varsity Stadium on Monday, August 15. Top ticket price was $10, which was the most ever charged for a non-Grey Cup game in Toronto. George Halas of the Bears, who also served as chairman of the NFL's expansion committee, admitted that in 1961 the NFL would have 14 teams, an awkward number, and that 16 teams would be more convenient for scheduling. It was suggested that this game was a trial balloon for a possible expansion team in Toronto. Chicago defeated the Giants by a 16\u20137 score, but the paid attendance was only 5,401, handing the promoters a $30,000 loss and effectively ending any chance of an NFL team north of the border.
