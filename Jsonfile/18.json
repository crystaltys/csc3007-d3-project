Nigro has received three Grammy's nominations for co-writing and producing Olivia Rodrigo's debut album Sour [6] and he has won three awards as one of the songwriters for \"Drivers License\", \"Deja Vu\" and \"Good 4 U\" at the 22nd ASCAP Pop Music Awards. Nigro and his high school friends Sean Fitzgerald, Brian Fortune, Cliff Sarcona founded the indie rock band As Tall As Lions in December 2001.[7] His band released their first extended play Blood and Aphorisms in July 2002 which led them to sign a joint development deal with Island and Triple Crown Records in October 2001.[8] The band released their debut album \"Lafcadio\" in 2004 and followed it up with their self-titled album in 2006, then set out on a tour in August and September of the same year. They released their third debut album You can't take it with you in 2009 and it peaked at no. 88 in Billboard 200. Unfortunately, the band amicably split-up in September 2010 and Nigro went to work on solo projects, named Blocks. Nigro moved to Los Angeles, California and continued writing music with his childhood friend Justin Raisen, a songwriter and producer, and began working relentlessly for song ideas and recorded demos without success on their first couple of years. Eventually, Nigro biggest break came when Sky Ferreira enlisted them for her album. Ferriera's album received critical acclaimed and opened doors for him to work with other singers.[9] Nigro has worked and co-written songs for singers Kylie Minogue, Kimbra, Carly Rae Jepsen, Lewis Capaldi, Finneas, Olivia Rodrigo, Conan Gray and many others.","Title":"Dan Nigro - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Nigro"}
