{"Content: ":"Robert Francis Furchgott (June 4, 1916 \u2013 May 19, 2009) was a Nobel Prize-winning American biochemist who contributed to the discovery of nitric oxide as a transient cellular signal in mammalian systems. Furchgott was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Arthur Furchgott (December 1884 \u2013 January 1971), a department store owner, and Pena (Sorentrue) Furchgott. He graduated with from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1937 with a degree in chemistry and went on to earn a Ph.D in biochemistry at Northwestern University in 1940.[1] Furchgott was faculty member and professor of pharmacology at Cornell University Medical College from 1940 to 1949, at Washington University School of Medicine from 1949 to 1956, at SUNY Brooklyn from 1956 to 1989, and at the University of Miami from 1989 through the end of his career. In 1978, Furchgott discovered a substance in endothelial cells that relaxes blood vessels, calling it endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF).[2] By 1986, he had worked out EDRF's nature and mechanism of action, and determined that EDRF was in fact nitric oxide (NO), an important compound in many aspects of cardiovascular physiology. This research is important in explaining a wide variety of neuronal, cardiovascular, and general physiologic processes of central importance in human health and disease.[3] In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of nitric oxide as a new cellular signal\u2014shared in 1998 with Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Furchgott's discovery, that NO gas causes blood vessels to dilate, provided a long sought-after explanation for the therapeutic effects of Nitroglycerin used to treat Angina pectoris and was later instrumental in the development of the erectile dysfunction treatment drug Viagra.[11] In 1991, Furchgott received a Gairdner Foundation International Award for his groundbreaking discoveries.[citation needed] He also received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1996[12] and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1999 with Ferid Murad.[13][14] Furchgott was Jewish[15] and lived most of his married and career life in Woodmere, New York on Long Island. He was married to Lenore Mandelbaum (February 1915 \u2013 April 1983)[16] from 1941 until her death at age 68. They had three daughters: Jane, Terry and Susan. His daughter, Susan, was an artist in the San Francisco counter-culture and co-founder of the Kerista Commune. Furchgott spent his later years with Margaret Gallagher Roth, who died March 14, 2006.[17] He served as a professor emeritus at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. In 2008, he moved to Seattle's Ravenna neighborhood. Furchgott died on May 19, 2009 in Seattle. He is survived by his three daughters, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.[18]","Title":"Robert F.
