{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Mali is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Mali in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[2][3] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[4][5] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[6][4] Model-based simulations for Mali suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t has been stable below 1.0 since December 2020.[7]  On 18 March, President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita suspended flights from affected countries, closed schools and banned large public gatherings.[43] However planned elections in March\u2013April, which had already been postponed several times for the poor security situation in the country, went ahead as planned.[44] Media related to COVID-19 pandemic in Mali at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Mali - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10316","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Mali"}
