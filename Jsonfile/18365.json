{"Content: ":"The Kentucky Fried Movie is a 1977 American independent sketch comedy film, produced by Kim Jorgensen, Larry Kostroff, and Robert K. Weiss, and directed by John Landis. Among the numerous star cameos are George Lazenby, Bill Bixby, Henry Gibson, Barry Dennen, Donald Sutherland, Tony Dow, Stephen Bishop, and the voice of Shadoe Stevens. According to writer David Zucker on the DVD commentary track, David Letterman auditioned for the role of the newscaster, but was not selected. The film also features many former members of The Groundlings and The Second City. The \"feature presentation\" portion of the film stars Evan C. Kim and hapkido grand master Bong Soo Han. The Kentucky Fried Movie marked the first film appearances of a number of actors who later became famous, and launched the careers of the Zucker brothers, Abrahams and Landis. Landis was recommended to direct National Lampoon's Animal House in 1978 based on his work with The Kentucky Fried Movie.[4] The film's writers were the team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, who subsequently wrote and directed Airplane!, Top Secret! and the Police Squad! television series and its film spin-offs, The Naked Gun films. The Kentucky Fried Movie contains largely unconnected sketches that parody various film genres, including exploitation films. The film's longest segment spoofs early kung-fu films, specifically Enter the Dragon; its title, A Fistful of Yen, refers to A Fistful of Dollars. Parodies of disaster films (\"That's Armageddon\"), blaxploitation films (\"Cleopatra Schwartz\"), and softcore porn/women-in-prison films (\"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\") are presented as \"Coming Attraction\" trailers. The fictional films are produced by \"Samuel L. Bronkowitz\" (a conflation of Samuel Bronston and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, but also a spoof of B-movie producer and American International Pictures co-founder Samuel Z. Arkoff).[citation needed] The sketch \"See You Next Wednesday\" mocks theater-based gimmicks like Sensurround by depicting a dramatic film presented in \"Feel-a-Round\", which involves an usher physically accosting a theater patron. Other sketches spoof TV commercials and programs, news broadcasts, and classroom educational films. The city of Detroit and its high crime rate are a running gag portraying the city as a hell on Earth; in \"A Fistful of Yen\", the evil drug lord orders a captured CIA agent to be sent to Detroit, and the agent screams and begs to be killed instead. The credits list the sketches incorrectly, as the writers changed the show order after the credits had been written. On second cut, they corrected this error.[citation needed] The following list is in the running order used in the film: 11 O'Clock News (Part 1) (:04) High Adventure (3:01) David Zucker, Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams made the rounds of the Hollywood studios with the concept and were rejected by all of them, being told, \"audiences didn't like movies composed of sketches\". Since the three believed in their material, which they had honed in front of the audiences with their improvisational troupe \"Kentucky Fried Theater\", they decided to make the movie on their own.[6] A wealthy real estate investor offered to finance the film if they would write a script. After completion of the screenplay, the investor had second thoughts and decided he did not want to finance the film alone. He said he would try to attract other investors if the three filmmakers would produce a 10-minute excerpt of the film, which he would finance. When the trio presented a budget of the short film to the investor, he backed out.[3] The prospect of shooting the short film so excited the trio that they decided to pay for it themselves. The 10-minute film cost $35,000, and with it they again approached the Hollywood studios. This time, they attached a young director named John Landis to the project, who came to their attention after an appearance on The Tonight Show promoting his first film Schlock.[5] However, once again, the studios turned them down.[3] Curious as to how audiences would react to their film, they persuaded exhibitor Kim Jorgenson to show it before one of his regularly scheduled films. When Jorgenson saw the short, he \"fell out of his seat laughing.\" He was so impressed that he offered to raise the money needed to make the full-length version. By having his fellow exhibitors screen the film before audiences in their theaters, he convinced them to put up the $650,000 budget. When released, Kentucky Fried Movie was a box-office success, returning domestic American rentals of $7.1 million.[3] Anchor Bay Entertainment released a region 1 DVD in 2000. This release is presented in widescreen (1.85:1) aspect ratio and full-frame (1.33:1). It includes commentary by Landis; writers ZAZ; and producer Robert K. Weiss. On July 4, 2011, Arrow Video in region 2 released a two-disc special edition DVD with the following special features: On July 2, 2013, Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray in a 1.85:1 aspect widescreen transfer. This version includes the original theatrical trailer, Arrow DVD release filmmaker commentary, and Zucker Bros. interview. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 81% based on reviews from 32 critics. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The now obscure pop culture references and spoofed commercials add to Kentucky Fried Movies anarchic, anything-goes spirit and wit.\"[7] On Metacritic it has a score of 61% based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[8] At the time, Variety described the film as having \"excellent production values and some genuine wit\" but also noted that film was juvenile and tasteless.[9] Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times wrote, \"Lots of people will probably like The Kentucky Fried Movie, just as they like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's hamburgers. But popularity is still no reason for deifying mediocrity.\"[10] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that the best moments were \"one-joke gags; its writers can't sustain their humor for longer pieces. So, what you're left with is a half-dozen decent gags, one overlong karate flick, and a few shots of bare breasts thrown in to titillate teenage boys.\"[11] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \"a diverting hit-and-miss satirical anthology.\"[12] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"As is inevitable in such undertakings there are some sophomoric moments, but on the whole 'Kentucky Fried Movie' is, amazingly enough, almost continually funny in its ribald way.\"[13] Writing three decades later in 2008, Ian Nathan of Empire magazine calls the film \"occasionally funny\"... \"in a scattershot and puerile way\", and he concludes the film is \"smart and satirical, but very dated\".[14] J. C. Ma√ßek III of PopMatters wrote, \"The Kentucky Fried Movie is, however, profane, experimental, violent, silly, hilarious, and occasionally quite sexually explicit (all of which surely helped its success over the years).\"[15] The film ranks number 87 on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies list.[4]","Title":"The Kentucky Fried Movie - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18365","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentucky_Fried_Movie"}
