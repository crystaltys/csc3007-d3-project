{"Content: ":"Opposition (54) The Landtag of Baden-Württemberg is the diet of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It convenes in Stuttgart and currently consists of 154 members of five political parties. The majority before the 2021 election was a coalition of the Alliance '90/The Greens (Die Grünen) and the CDU, supporting the cabinet of Green Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann. After the elections of 14 March 2021, the composition of the Landtag is as follows: Elections are conducted using a mixed-member proportional representation system, with a minimum of 5% vote share to receive any seats. However, there are some exceptions, making the Baden-Württemberg election system one of the most complicated in Germany.[2] The minimum size of the Landtag is 120 members, of which 70 members are elected in single-member constituencies with first-past-the-post voting, and 50 are elected by propotional representation. Overhang and levelling seats may be added. The main difference in their electoral system compared to the federal Bundestag is that there are no list members, making all members local. Proportionality is maintained by parties awarding remaining seats to candidates within a party who didn't win a geographic district (a Zweitmandat, or \"second mandate\") ordered by most to least popular (e.g. a candidate losing with 47% of the vote would be placed ahead of a candidate losing with 20% of votes in their district). This does mean that a candidate who placed second within their district isn't guaranteed a seat, if other losers in their party were more popular and if their party only needs a small number of seats to maintain proportionality. 1st Landtag. 2nd Landtag. 3rd Landtag. 4th Landtag. 5th Landtag. 6th Landtag. 7th Landtag. 8th Landtag. 9th Landtag. 10th Landtag. 11th Landtag. 12th Landtag. 13th Landtag. 14th Landtag. 15th Landtag. 16th Landtag. 17th Landtag.
