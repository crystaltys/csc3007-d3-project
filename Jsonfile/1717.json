{"Content: ":"Diploë (/ˈdɪploʊi/ or DIP-lo-ee) is the spongy cancellous bone separating the inner and outer layers of the cortical bone of the skull.[1] In the cranial bones, the layers of compact cortical tissue are familiarly known as the tables of the skull; the outer one is thick and tough; the inner is thin, dense, and brittle, and hence is termed the vitreous table. The intervening cancellous tissue is called the diploë. In certain regions of the skull this becomes absorbed so as to leave spaces filled with liquid between the two tables. From Ancient Greek διπλόη (diplóē, \u201cliterally, a fold\u201d), noun use of feminine of διπλόος (diplóos, \u201cdouble\u201d) This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 80 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)  This neuroanatomy article is a stub.
