{"Content: ":"Kherson Oblast (Ukrainian: Херсо́нська о́бласть, romanized: Khersónsʹka óblastʹ, IPA: [xerˈsɔnʲsʲkɐ ˈɔbɫɐsʲtʲ]), also known as Khersonshchyna (Ukrainian: Херсо́нщина, [xerˈsɔnʃt͡ʃɪnɐ]), is an oblast (province) in southern Ukraine. It is located just north of Crimea. Its administrative center is Kherson. The area of the region is 28,461 km2 and the population 1,016,707 (2021 est.)[5] It is considered the 'fruit basket' of the country, as much of its agricultural production is dispersed throughout the country, with production peaking during the summer months. Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kherson city and most of the oblast has been occupied by Russian forces as the Kherson military\u2013civilian administration. The Kherson Oblast is bordered by Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on the north, the Black Sea and the disputed region of Crimea on the south, Mykolaiv Oblast on the west, and the Azov Sea and Zaporizhzhia Oblast on the east. The Dnieper River runs through the oblast which includes the Kakhovka Reservoir. The oblast includes (within Henichesk Raion) the northern portion of the Arabat Spit, a thin strip of land between the brackish Syvash and the Sea of Azov that is geographically part of the Crimean Peninsula. Due to Russia gaining de facto control of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in 2014, the southern areas of Kherson were the only parts of the Crimean Peninsula under direct Ukrainian control prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Until the 2020 re-organisation, the Kherson Oblast was administratively subdivided into 18 raions (districts) and 3 municipalities. The municipalities \u2013 Kherson (administrative center of the oblast), Nova Kakhovka, and Kakhovka \u2013 were directly subordinate to the oblast government. The Kherson municipality was subdivided into 3 urban districts. All information below was current as of 2015.[12] .* Note: Though the administrative center of the raion is housed in the city/town that it is named after, cities do not answer to the raion authorities only towns do; instead they are directly subordinated to the oblast government and therefore are not counted as part of raion statistics. At a lower level of administration, these district-level administrations are subdivided into: The local administration of the oblast is controlled by the Kherson Oblast Rada. The governor of the oblast is the Kherson Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine. The population of the oblast is 1,083,367 (2012), which is 2.4% of the total population of Ukraine. It is also ranked 21st by its population. The population density is 38 per km2. About 61.5% or 745,400 people live in urban areas of the Oblast and 38.5% or 467,600 people live in agricultural centers/villages. Men make up 46.7% or 565,400 people of the population, women make up 53.3% or 644,600 people, and pensioners make up 26.2% or 317,400 people of the Oblast population. Ukrainian National Census (2001): During the 1991 referendum, 90.13% of votes in Kherson Oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 90.9% of the oblast's population opposed their region joining Russia, 1% did support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.[13] Coordinates: 46°30\u2032N 34°00\u2032E﻿ / ﻿46.500°N 34.000°E﻿ / 46.500; 34.000","Title":"Kherson Oblast - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15578","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kherson_Oblast"}
