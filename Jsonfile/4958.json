{"Content: ":"Sam Rayburn Democratic Sam Rayburn Democratic The 1944 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives in 1944 that coincided with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's re-election to a record fourth term. Roosevelt's popularity allowed his Democratic Party to gain twenty seats from the Republicans and minor parties, cementing the Democratic majority. Also, Americans rallied behind allied success in World War II, and in turn voted favorably for the administration's course of action. As of 2022[update], this is the last time the House of Representatives was made up of four parties. In December 2020, House Republican Paul Mitchell became an Independent, resulting in there being four partisan affiliations (Republican, Democratic, Independent, and Libertarian) though not four political parties. Twelve special elections were held, sorted by election date.
