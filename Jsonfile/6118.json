{"Content: ":"The Frankfurt City Forest or Frankfurter Stadtwald is a forest district in the south of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. There are also other forest areas spread out through the city. The forest is about 48 square kilometres and the largest inner-city forest in Germany. It covers the southern areas of Schwanheim, Niederrad, Sachsenhausen and Oberrad, as well the northern parts of the Stadtteil Flughafen district. Four nature trails and sport paths cross the Forest. There are also 1600 seating benches and 25 rest huts, which provide protection in bad weather. Six playgrounds and nine ponds make the forest a popular local attraction.

In 1372 Frankfurt bought the city forest from Emperor Charles IV and wanted to regain these rights. This sparked a hundred-year fight with the Knights, which ended with a compromise in 1484. The city paid a sum to graze sheep on the land, but the area was limited. One can still see the stones of the border on the Schäfersteinpfad, Shepherd Stone Path. The use of the forest by farmers for grazing is still evident in the names, Unterschwein- und Oberschweinstiege, which were overnight stables for the acorn and beech nut eating pigs.
