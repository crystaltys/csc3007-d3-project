He relates the human story. He was an actor before, but he's not acting now, that's why he's so effective.\"[91] British journalist David Patrikarakos described Zelenskyy as \"the literal man on the street,\" saying that he was sending a message that \"I'm your president, I'm not hiding, I'm not going anywhere.
