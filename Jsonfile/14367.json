It is situated to the north-east of the capital Colombo. It is the sixth largest urban area in Western Province, after Colombo, Negombo, Kalutara, Panadura and Avissawella.[2] Gampaha is also the second largest municipal centre in Gampaha district, after Negombo. Gampaha has a land area of 25.8 ha (64 acres) and is home to the offices of 75 government institutions. The name \"Gampaha\" in Sinhala (ගම්පහ) literally means \u201cFive Villages\u201d. The five villages are known to be Ihalagama, Pahalagama, Medagama, Pattiyagama and Aluthgama. However, at present the location of Pattiyagama can no longer be identified within the town limits of Gampaha and remains disputed. Gampaha was also formerly known as Henarathgoda. During reign of Portuguese, the main route to the hill country had been laid through the Gampaha area and in the period of Dutch, this area was served as centre for the collection of cinnamon.[3] But before year 1815, it is said that Gampaha was a dense forest. The 5th Governor of Ceylon, Sir Edward Barnes made a visit to Gampaha in 1825, on the way to observe the construction work of the Negombo-Colombo main road. When British built the \u201cMoragoda\u201d catholic church in 1828, Gampaha and surrounding areas slowly became inhabited. As the extension of the railway track from Colombo to Ambepussa, the Henarathgoda railway station was completed in 1866 which acted as a key factor for the progress and recognition of the town. In 1867, the first rubber tree of Sri Lanka was planted in Henarathgoda botanical garden. The town was planned in 1920, with 52 roads including the main street, a water tank, a public market, a hospital and an electrical generator. Most of these are still present in their original sites with various improvements over time.[4] Gampaha was a village council until 1945. On 1 January that year, the town qualified to become an urban council. The first urban council had five members. P. P. Jayawardane was the first chairman of the urban council. Total number of workforce in the urban council was 197 persons. In 1978 constitutional reforms declared Gampaha as a new administrative district (which was formerly recognised as a part of the Colombo District) and the main administrative centre was established in Gampaha.[3] The new district status lead the town to a rapid development, establishing new government institutes. On 16 April 2002, the Urban Council was upgraded to become the Gampaha Municipal Council. The economy of Gampaha has been vastly extended in many aspects.
