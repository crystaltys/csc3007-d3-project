{"Content: ":"The Pontifical Commission for the Vatican City State (Italian: Pontificia Commissione per lo Stato della Città del Vaticano; Latin: Pontificia Commissio pro Civitate Vaticana) is the legislative body of Vatican City.[1] It consists of a president, who also holds the title of President of the Governorate of the Vatican City State, and six other cardinals appointed by the pope for five-year terms.[1] The Pontifical Commission was created in 1939 by Pius XII. Laws and regulations proposed by the Commission must be submitted to the pope through the Secretariat of State prior to being made public and taking effect.[1] Laws, regulations, and instructions enacted by the Commission are published in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis.[2] As of 2022, the president and the members are: In addition to his legislative role, the President of the Governorate of the Vatican City State, who since 1 October 2021 has been Archbishop Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, has been delegated executive authority for the Vatican City State as the president of the Governorate of the Vatican City State by the pope. As a senior member of the Roman Curia, the president is usually a cardinal of the Catholic Church.[4] During a sede vacante, the term of the president ends, as do most other offices in the Curia. However, the holder of the office prior to the death or resignation of the pope becomes a member of the Commission that handles some of the functions of the head of state until a new pope can be chosen, along with the former Cardinal Secretary of State and the Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church.[5] The President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also serves as the head of government of Vatican City, the president of the Governorate of the Vatican City State, an office which is distinct from the former title of Governor of Vatican City.[6] In addition to his legislative role, the President is delegated executive authority for Vatican City by the Pope.[7][8] Administrations and departments of Vatican City's government, including the Corpo della Gendarmeria, the Vatican Observatory, the Vatican Museums, and the Department of Pontifical Villas, which administers Castel Gandolfo, report to the Governorate.[9] The functions of the Governorate include:","Title":"Pontifical Commission for the Vatican City State - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15074","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Commission_for_the_State_of_Vatican_City"}
