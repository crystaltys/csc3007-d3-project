{"Content: ":"In Polish poetry, the Ukrainian school were a group of Romantic poets of the early 19th century who hailed from the southeastern fringes of the Polish-inhabited lands of the time (this period followed the partition of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth; today mostly part of Ukraine).[1][2] The poets\u2014Antoni Malczewski, Józef Bohdan Zaleski, Tomasz Padura and Seweryn Goszczyński\u2014produced a distinct style of Polish Romanticism through the incorporation of Ukrainian life, landscapes, history, political events, and folklore into their works.[1] They in turn influenced both Lithuanian and Ukrainian Romantic poetry, and, along with other Polish poets, constituted a link between the various literatures of the post-partition Commonwealth.[2] This poetry-related article is a stub.
