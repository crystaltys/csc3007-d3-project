Specialised health care has to be performed on Antigua or Guadeloupe.[14] On 18 March, the first case in Montserrat was confirmed. The patient had travelled from London to Antigua before arriving in Montserrat. On the 13 March the authorities had notified that a COVID-19 patient had been discovered on that flight and subsequently all passengers were quarantined and tested.[2][16] On 23 March, the second case was confirmed. The patient had no travel history and was the first case of community spread.[17] On 26 March, three more cases were confirmed to be positive bringing the total to five cases of COVID-19 on the island of Montserrat.[18] On 7 April, the number of cases had increased to eight.[12] On 24 April, the first death related to COVID-19 on Montserrat, that of a 92-year female, was sadly announced.[3] On 25 April, Montserrat had been without new infections for its second week.[19] On 6 May, Premier Joseph E. Farrell announced that the testing machines for COVID-19 will arrive shortly and that island will soon be able to test.[20] On 12 May, a business impact assessment was released. COVID-19 caused US$3.6 million in economic disruption.[21] On 15 May, it was reported that there are no more active cases on Montserrat.[4] On 10 July, a new case had been discovered. The person had been on the island since March. Contact tracing is under way.[5] On 7 August, the last two cases recovered, and the island once again has no more active cases.[1] The island began its vaccination campaign on 8 February 2021; by 11 May 1321 people in Montserrat (28.4%) had received at least one dose of the vaccine and 976 (21.0%) had received their second dose.[22] Chronology of the number of active cases [b]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Montserrat - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10709","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Montserrat"}
