{"Content: ":"Girl You Know It's True is a 1989 album that served as the North American debut of German contemporary R&B duo Milli Vanilli. It is a version of Milli Vanilli's Europe-only release All or Nothing reconfigured and repackaged for the US market. The album was a major success in the USA, producing five singles that entered the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100, three of which reached the top position. In January 1990, Girl You Know It's True was certified 6Ã— platinum by the RIAA after spending seven weeks atop the Billboard Top 200.[4] Additionally, the album spent 41 weeks within the top 10 of the Billboard Top 200 and 78 weeks within the charts overall.[5] The album was also certified Diamond in Canada, denoting shipments of over one million units. The success of the album earned the duo a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on February 22, 1990. On November 16, 1990, Los Angeles Times freelancer Chuck Philips reported that the group, which consisted of reputed vocalists Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan, did not sing a single note on the album.[6] Arista Records dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalog, making it one of the largest-selling albums to ever be deleted. In addition to this, their Grammy Award was revoked,[7] marking the first time a Grammy was ever rescinded from an artist. According to producer Frank Farian, the decision to repackage All or Nothing as Girl You Know It's True was made by Arista Records president Clive Davis.[8] In addition to including five of the tracks that originally appeared on All or Nothing (\"I'm Gonna Miss You\", \"All or Nothing\", \"Baby Don't Forget My Number\", \"Dreams to Remember\" and \"Girl You Know It's True\"), Girl You Know It's True featured several new tracks, including \"Blame It on the Rain\", which would go on to be a worldwide hit single, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In Europe, the track later appeared in an extended version on the album All or Nothing - The U.S. Remix Album.[9] The track orders of some US releases are out of sequence with the listings printed on their cover art, while several tracks are listed with incorrect running times, and some of the writers' credits are inconsistent with what is listed in external sources. ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.","Title":"Girl You Know It's True - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3008","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_You_Know_It%27s_True"}
