{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Aruba is part of the ongoing global viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was documented for the first time in Aruba on 13 March 2020. As of 29 May, all cases recovered.[3] On 29 June, two new cases were discovered.[4] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[5][6] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[7][8] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[9][7] 13 March 2020 - Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes announced the first two confirmed cases of coronavirus on the island.[10] As a result, the country restricted entry of all individuals coming from Europe via air and seaports \u2013 starting on March 15 and in effect until 31 March \u2013 with the exception of those who are Aruban citizens.[10] They also suspended public and private school classes for the week of 16 March, as well as all large-scale public gatherings.[11] 15 March 2020 - At approximately 8pm AST, Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes announced that there would be a lockdown on all inbound international travel commencing at midnight of 16 March 2020 and ending 31 March 2020. An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time. To this date Aruba had two confirmed coronavirus cases. It is important to note that this lockdown does not apply to outbound travel for international travelers currently in Aruba \u2013 they will be able to take their return flight home.[10] 16 March 2020 - The third case of the coronavirus was reported, a doctor who recently travelled to New York for her vacation. She did not show any symptoms, but was tested, and the results of the test showed she was positive for the virus.[12] 17 March 2020 \u2013 Fourth case of coronavirus announced. The person who tested positive for the coronavirus is a tourist.[13] 20 March 2020 \u2013 Fifth case of coronavirus announced. The patient is an employee of the airport, who arrived back from New York, where he was on vacation. This was discovered a day after there was public protest over the lack of measures on the airport to protect employees against contagion.[14] 21 March 2020 \u2013 Three more cases have been announced, bringing the total to eight. It concerns two people from outside of Aruba (one from New York and one from Miami). The third case is possibly the first locally transmitted case.[15] 22 March 2020 \u2013 A ninth case is now known to be a CMB employee, who had returned from travel to the USA. He has been to work only a relatively short time and has had no contact with customers.

Of these 5 cases, three are locally transmitted.[18] 25 March 2020 \u2013 Only two new cases are reported, totaling 19. It's possible this is the effect of the drastic measures that were taken earlier this month, such as the ongoing curfew. It concerns one imported case from Colombia, and one locally transmitted case.[19] 26 March 2020 \u2013 Nine new cases are reported, totaling 28. This is likely related to the increased testing, which has now doubled (from 50 per day to 100 per day). Several cases are employees of Respaldo, the mental health institute of Aruba, which is situated close to the hospital.[20] 27 March 2020 \u2013 Five new cases on this day are reported, bringing the island to 33 cases.

There is no record yet as to the origin of these new cases.[22] 29 March 2020 \u2013 Only four new cases this day (total 50). A possible cause is the effect of public measures that started 15 March. Initially the number was set to six cases, but two of those appeared to be false positives.[23] 31 March 2020 \u2013 Unfortunately another increase of 5 cases (total 55).
