{"Content: ":"Greetings From The Shore is a 2007 American coming-of-age romantic comedy film directed by Greg Chwerchak. The movie has played over 60 festivals, winning over 20 awards. It had its American theatrical release on September 12, 2008, on a limited basis.[1] The film is set (and was shot) on the New Jersey shore, mainly in Lavallette. Still reeling from the death of her father, a young girl spends one last summer at the Jersey Shore before heading off to college. But when her plans fall apart, the girl stumbles into a mysterious world of Russian sailors, high-stakes gambling, and unexpected love. When the film was released Neil Genzlinger, the film critic of The New York Times, was critical of the actors experience, writing, \"The problem with having a big-name actor in your small film is that he tends to underscore the inexperience of some of your other stars. That\u2019s the effect Paul Sorvino has in Greetings From the Shore, a watchable-enough summer-at-the-beach tale billed as Gabrielle Berberich\u2019s first feature as writer and producer...until Mr. Sorvino, a real actor and a good one, shows up. He plays a down-on-his-luck fisherman who takes the girl under his wing, and he makes Ms. Shaw and some of the other cast members look like amateurs. The director, Greg Chwerchak (who also gets a writing credit), doesn\u2019t help; he allows several secondary characters to become thudding clich√©s, trampling the delicate story.\"[2] Film critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the web based Spirituality & Practice, discussed the basic theme of the film, \"Jenny's summer teaches her to go with the flow when her life plan is upset. She also learns that the universe is set up in such a felicitous way that when a door closes, a window opens.\"[3] Critic David Hiltbrand liked the film, writing, \"It's a formulaic and familiar plot, the Jersey girl version of The Flamingo Kid. But it unfolds smoothly, thanks to Greg Chwerchak's focused direction. And the water down on Barnegat Inlet Island looks oddly idyllic on film. Greetings From the Shore is well-acted, including by newcomer Shaw, who has an appealing, wide-eyed innocence reminiscent of a young Meg Ryan. This is a two-hankie weeper that doesn't really earn its tears. But it's a sweet little movie nonetheless.\"[4] Wins","Title":"Greetings from the Shore - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18656","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greetings_from_the_Shore_(film)"}
