{"Content: ":"The Russian Wikipedia (Russian: Русская Википедия, romanized: Russkaya Vikipediya) is the Russian-language edition of Wikipedia. As of July 2022, it has 1,840,364 articles. It was started on 11 May 2001.[1] In October 2015, it became the sixth-largest Wikipedia by the number of articles. It has the sixth-largest number of edits (124 million). In June 2020, it was the world's 6th most visited language Wikipedia after the English Wikipedia, the Japanese Wikipedia, the Spanish Wikipedia, the German Wikipedia and the French Wikipedia.[2] It is the largest Wikipedia written in any Slavic language, surpassing its nearest rival, the Polish Wikipedia, eightfold by the parameter of depth.[3] In addition, the Russian Wikipedia is the largest Wikipedia written in Cyrillic[4] or in a script other than Latin script. In April 2016, the project had 3,377 active editors who made at least five edits in that month, ranking third behind the English and Spanish versions. It is the most popular Wikipedia in many former Soviet republics and the second most popular in others, owing its position in the national language status that Russian had in the Soviet era and the Russification policies during the Soviet Union, and Russian continues to be the second language of most of these states. Since the early 2010s, Russian Wikipedia and its editors have experienced numerous and increasing threats of nationwide blocks and country-wide enforcement of blacklisting by the Russian government, as well as several attempts at Internet censorship, propaganda, and disinformation,[5][6][7][8][9][10] more recently during the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian war in the Donbas region[11][12][13][14] and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[15] Difficult issues are resolved through the Arbitration Committee, which handles content disputes, blocks users or prohibits certain users from editing articles on certain topics.[16] Administrators (currently 76) are elected through a vote; a minimum quorum of 30 voters and 66% of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful. Administrators who have become inactive (i.e. have not used administrative tools, such as \"delete\" or \"block\" buttons, at least 25 times in six months) may lose their privileges by an Arbitration Committee decision.[17] As of 1 June 2012, some of the biggest categories (which contain more than 5,000 articles) in the Russian Wikipedia are:[18] 10,340 articles contain material from the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. More than 47,000 articles were translated from the English Wikipedia. In addition to common Wikipedia namespaces, the Russian Wikipedia has three custom ones: \"Incubator\" (# 102\u2013103) \u2013 which is used as a training camp for new users and their first articles, \"Project\" (# 104\u2013105) \u2013 for Wikipedia projects and \"Arbitration\" (# 106\u2013107) \u2013 for arbitration requests. On user pages, users are able to see their outreach, the cumulative view count of pages they have edited. In 2015, Roman Leibov [ru; et], a professor at University of Tartu, in an interview opined that articles related to humanities in the Russian Wikipedia are of considerably inferior quality compared to English Wikipedia, and some articles even deteriorate with time. He suggested that this effect is due to overzealous policing of intellectual property rights by the community and bemoaned poor editing skills of some Wikipedians.[19] In 2022, the San Francisco Examiner praised the Russian Wikipedia for \"filling the information vacuum\" while \"independent media abandon Russia or are censored\" during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[20] The Russian Wikipedia was created on 20 May 2001 in the first wave of non-English Wikipedias, along with editions in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, German, Esperanto, French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. The first edit of the Russian Wikipedia was on 24 May 2001, and consisted of the line \"Россия \u2013 великая страна\"(\"Russia is a great nation\"). The following edit changed it to the joke: \"Россия \u2013 родина слонов (ушастых, повышенной проходимости \u2013 см. мамонт)\" (\"Russia is the motherland of elephants (big-eared, improved cross-country capability, see Mammoth.\")[25] For a long time development was slow (especially after some participants left for WikiZnanie), but in the 12-month period between February 2005 and February 2006 it surpassed nine editions in other languages \u2013 the Catalan, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Finnish, Norwegian, Chinese, Esperanto, and Danish Wikipedias. In 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010[26] the Russian Wikipedia won the \"Science and education\" category of the \"Runet Prize\" (Russian: Премия Рунета) award, supervised by the Russian government agency FAPMC.[27] On 10 July 2012, Russian Wikipedia closed access to its content for 24 hours in protest against proposed amendments to Russia's Information Act (Bill No. 89417-6) regulating the accessibility of Internet-based information to children. Among other things, the bill stipulates the creation and country-wide enforcement of blacklists, which would block access to forbidden sites. Several aspects of this amendment drew criticism from various civil rights activists and Internet providers. In particular, the blacklist inclusion criteria were characterized as \"too vague\" and \"paving the way for Internet censorship\".[5] Supporters of the amendment stated that it is aimed only at widely prohibited content such as child pornography and similar information, but the Russian Wikimedia chapter has declared that conditions for determining the content falling under this law will create a thing like the \"great Chinese firewall\". They further claimed that existing Russian legal practice demonstrates a high likelihood of a worst-case scenario, resulting in a country-wide ban of Wikipedia.[6][7] The second and the third readings of the law were held in the State Duma on 11 July; no essential corrections were introduced. The law will come into force after three readings in the State Duma, one reading in the Federation Council and presidential approval.[8] On 10 July, Nikolai Nikiforov, Russian Minister for Telecommunications and Mass Media announced in his Twitter account, that the organization of the List of the prohibited websites (that was sited on the Law Project No. 89417-6) will be suspended until 1 November 2012.[8][28] On the same day Yelena Mizulina, a Duma deputy and the head of the subcommittee which sponsored the law, said that the blackout is an attempt to blackmail the Duma and was sponsored by the \"pedophile lobby\".[29] Also, since 2012, Russian foreign agent law resulted in reduced funding available for the Russian Wikipedia and its volunteers, who no longer can receive financial aid from abroad, including their share of funds raised through global Wikipedia fundraisers.[30] On 5 April 2013, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media that Wikipedia had been blacklisted over the article \"Курение каннабиса\" (\"Cannabis smoking\") on Russian Wikipedia.[31][10] On 31 March 2013, The New York Times reported that Russia was 'Selectively Blocking [the] Internet',[9] though Wikipedia itself was not blocked at that time. Articles on Russian Wikipedia, and also on other Wikipedia versions, concerning the shoot down of flight MH17 and the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian war in the Donbas region have been targeted by Internet propaganda outlets associated with the Putin-led Russian government.[11][12][13][14] Some of the edits were spotted by a Twitter bot which monitors Wikipedia edits made from Russian government IP addresses.[12][13][14] The entire Russian Wikipedia was blocked in the Russian Federation for a few hours in August 2015 due to the contents of the article on charas.[32] In November 2019, Russian president Vladimir Putin called for a government-run alternative to Wikipedia. The Guardian reported state funds had already been allocated according to official documents published the previous September. The new electronic alternative was intended to be based on the Great Russian Encyclopedia.[33] According to the London Times, the proposal had been abandoned by mid-May 2020,[34] however, according to Great Russian Encyclopedia employee Yekaterina Chukovskaya, only the working group was disbanded and work on the project as a whole will continue.[35] In February and March 2022, in the first week following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and breakout of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian Wikipedia editors warned their readers and fellow editors of several, reiterated attempts by the Putin-led Russian government of political censorship, Internet propaganda, disinformation attacks, and disruptive editing towards an article listing of Russian military casualties as well as Ukrainian civilians and children due to the ongoing war.[15] The Wikipedia was generally considered under threat in Russia.[36] On 11 March 2022, Belarusian political police GUBOPiK arrested and detained editor of Russian Wikipedia from Minsk Mark Bernstein, who was editing the Wikipedia article about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, accusing him of the \"spread of anti-Russian materials\" and of violating Russian \"fake news\" laws.[37][38][39]","Title":"Russian Wikipedia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16042","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-language_Wikipedia"}
