{"Content: ":"The 1976 sterling crisis was a balance of payments, or currency crisis, in the United Kingdom in 1976 which caused James Callaghan's Labour government to borrow $3.9 billion[a] from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),[2] with the intention of maintaining the value of the pound.[3] At the time this was the largest loan ever to have been requested from the IMF.[4] Inflation hit close to 25% in 1975, causing high bond yields and borrowing costs, and the 1973 oil crisis were contributors to the problem.[5] The crisis took place during James Callaghan's term as Prime Minister,[6] and caused the Bank of England to withdraw temporarily from the foreign exchange market.[7] After the defeat of the public expenditure white paper in the House of Commons in March 1976 and the resignation of Harold Wilson, many investors became convinced sterling would soon lose value due to inflation. By June 1976, the pound had reached a record low against the dollar.[4] Only half of the loan was actually drawn by the British government and it was repaid by 4 May 1979.[8] Denis Healey, the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, went on to state that the main reason the loan had to be requested was that public sector borrowing requirement figures provided by the treasury were grossly overstated.[9] Despite this all terms required by the IMF were fully implemented. The IMF loan meant that the United Kingdom's economy could be stabilised whilst drastic budget cuts were implemented. Despite the security provided by the loan, the Labour Party had already begun separating into social democratic and left-wing camps, causing bitter rows inside the party and with the unions. Some believe this may have contributed significantly to Margaret Thatcher's 1979 Conservative victory.[10]","Title":"1976 sterling crisis - Wikipedia","KeyID":"13151","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_sterling_crisis"}
