Either the winner of this trophy or the winner of the Lew Hayman Trophy will also win the Canadian Football League Most Outstanding Canadian award. The Martin trophy is named after former Saskatchewan Roughriders president Beattie Martin. Originally presented in 1949, it served as the Western Interprovincial Football Union's award for the outstanding Canadian rookie until 1974. As part of the failed American expansion, the Martin trophy was awarded in 1995 to the North Division's outstanding Canadian.
