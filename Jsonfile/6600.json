{"Content: ":"The German Architecture Museum (German: Deutsches Architekturmuseum) (DAM) is located on the Museumsufer in Frankfurt, Germany. Housed in an 18th-century building, the interior has been re-designed by Oswald Mathias Ungers in 1984 as a set of \"elemental Platonic buildings within elemental Platonic buildings\".[1] It houses a permanent exhibition entitled \"From Ancient Huts to Skyscrapers\" which displays the history of architectural development in Germany.[2] The museum organises several temporary exhibitions every year, as well as conferences, symposia and lectures. It has a collection of ca. 180,000 architectural drawings and 600 models, including works by modern and contemporary classics like Erich Mendelsohn, Mies van der Rohe, Archigram and Frank O. Gehry. It also includes a reference library with approximately 25,000 books and magazines.[3] The DAM grants several awards: Coordinates: 50°6\u203218\u2033N 8°40\u203238.5\u2033E﻿ / ﻿50.10500°N 8.677361°E﻿ / 50.10500; 8.677361  This article about a Hesse building or structure is a stub.
