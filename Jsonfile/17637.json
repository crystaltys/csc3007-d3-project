Horizontally they are divided into the chief and the base. The Dexter or Right: Arm of the See of Jaro The black eagle and the three red roses on the sinister bend undoubtedly refer to St Elizabeth of Hungary, the patroness of the Archdiocese of Jaro. Saint Elizabeth is the daughter of the King of Hungary and the wife of a Landgrave (Count) of Thurgingia, Germany. The black eagle is said to be the bravest bird, the emblem of magninimity and fortitude of mind. And of such color was the eagle of the Roman Emperors, now used by the Germans because the color and appears at a great distance. The three red roses remind us of the legend narrated in the biography of St Elizabeth. She is generally represented as a princess graciously giving alms to the poor or holding roses in her lap; in the latter case, she is portrayed as surprised by her husband who met her unexpectedly as she went secretly on an errand of mercy, and so, the story runs, the bread she was trying to conceal suddenly turned into rose, the coconut palms on a green knoll represent Jaro. The Sinister or Left: Personal Arms of Archbishop Lagdameo: Occupying the prominent place of the Christ is the monogram of the Blessed Virgin, A and M, on the top of which is the Jesuit monogram IHS mounted on the San Jose Seminary Seal. This shows the Archbishop's loyalty to his alma mater where he had his priestly formation under the Jesuit Fathers. The wings on the side of the monogram of Our Lady completes the symbolism to represent Our Lady of the Angels on whose feast day (2 August) Archbishop Lagdameo was born. Lucban, the birthplace of the Archbishop is represented on the lower portion of the Arm by a fruit of a citrus family called \"Lucban\" (Citrus Maxima) from which the town got its name. The mountain represents the scenic Mount Banahaw at the foot of which lies serenely the town of Lucban. At the bottom is the Franciscan Symbol \u2014 the hand of Christ nailed to the cross and the hand of St Francis bearing the stigma. The symbol indicates Archbishop Lagdameo's affiliation to the order of Franciscan Secular. It is also a reminder of the Patron Saint of Lucban, St. Louis, Bishop of Toulouse, a Franciscan bishop of the 13th century to whose intercession the big number of priests coming from Lucban is attributed. The Motto: Your presence, O Lord, I seek (Ps. 27:8) Faciem tuam; Domine, Requiram. I long to see your face, O Lord, Archbishop Lagdameo believes that union with God achieved through prayer is the beginning, terminus a quo, and end, terminus ad quem, of priestly or missionary activity. It was also the motto of Bishop Alfredo Ma. Obviar of Lucena, whom Lagdameo served as secretary. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, due to the Filipino people's clamor for a united political stance, called an emergency meeting on 25 February 2008. Under his CBCP presidency, Archbishop Leonard Legaspi of Caceres announced the Bishops' statement: \"They refused to call for her resignation saying they wanted her, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, to be part of the moral reform process.[citation needed]","Title":"Angel Lagdameo - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17637","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Lagdameo"}
