{"Content: ":"Col du Granon (el. 2,413 m or 7,917 ft) is a high mountain pass in the Alps in the department of Hautes-Alpes in France. A narrow tarmac road winds steeply up the southern approach. Gravel roads continue beyond the pass, in a military training zone.[citation needed] It hosted the highest ever mountain-top stage finish in the Tour de France\u2014once only\u2014in 1986, until the 2011 Tour de France, that had a finish in the Col du Galibier, at 2,645 m (8,678 ft) of altitude. Eduardo Chozas of Spain won the stage after a long lone breakaway. During the 2022 Tour de France Team Jumbo-Visma launched a relentless attack against two-time defending champion Tadej Pogačar, using Wout Van Aert, Christophe Laporte and Primoz Roglič, which allowed Jonas Vingegaard to seize the yellow jersey. Like LeMond in 1986, Vingegaard would defend his lead for the rest of the race.[1] Two roads lead to the pass at 2,645 m (8,678 ft). The D234T climbs 11.5 kilometres (7.1 mi) with a 9% average gradient from Saint-Chaffrey at an altitude of 1,364 metres (4,475 ft). From the east a dirt road to the military pass at Val-des-Prés climbs 15.3 kilometres (9.5 mi) at almost 7% gradient.  This Hautes-Alpes geographical article is a stub.
