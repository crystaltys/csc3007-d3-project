{"Content: ":"The Ukravtodor or The State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Державне агентство автомобільних доріг України) is the agency within the Ministry of Infrastructure that oversees the road signs in Ukraine. The state agency Ukravtodor was established as a state corporation in 1990, replacing the Ministry of Roadways of Soviet Ukraine as the state governing body of automobile roads in modern Ukraine. It is supplemented by a project institute Ukrhiprodor which designs objects of road management. Ukravtodor[1] is supervised by the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine.[2] On February 28, 2002, by the presidential order the state owned open stock company Avtomobilni dorohy Ukrainy (ADU) was created.[3] The company was directly involved in road construction and maintenance. In 2016 ADU was merged into Ukravtodor, with the latter now owning 100% of its shares.[4] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the agency requested citizens to remove traffic signs to confuse Russian troops.[5] They also used Google Maps to update citizens on the locations of Russian Ground Forces.[6]  This article about transport in Ukraine is a stub.
