{"Content: ":"Mladá fronta Dnes (Young Front Today), also known as MF DNES or simply Dnes (Today), is a daily newspaper in the Czech Republic.[1] Its name could be translated into English as Youth Front Today. As of 2016, it is the second largest Czech newspaper,[2] after the Czech tabloid Blesk. The paper was set up in 1945 under the name Mladá fronta as a daily newspaper for youth. During the era of socialism, Mladá fronta was the newspaper of the Socialist Union of Youth. After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, its popularity grew and nowadays it is not connected to the Socialist Youth in any way, neither in terms of organisation nor policy. The paper is owned by Mafra a.s., a subsidiary of the Agrofert group, a company owned by the Czech Prime Minister (from 2018), Andrej Babiš. MAFRA a.s. was previously the Czech subsidiary of the German group Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei- und Verlagsgesellschaft GmbH[3] (the publisher of the Rheinische Post), that bought it from French press group Socpresse in 1994. MAFRA a.s. also owns the Czech daily newspaper Lidové noviny, the Czech edition of the freesheet Metro, the TV music channel Óčko. The paper is published in Berliner format.[4] It consists of four sections, one of which contains regional content. Its orientation can be described as right-wing conservative.[1]","Title":"Mladá fronta DNES - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16123","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mlad%C3%A1_fronta_DNES"}
