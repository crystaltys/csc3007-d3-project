{"Content: ":"A viral vector vaccine is a vaccine that uses a viral vector to deliver genetic material coding for a desired antigen into the recipient's host cells. As of April 2021[update], six viral vector vaccines have been authorized for use in humans in at least one country: four COVID-19 vaccines and two Ebola vaccines. Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of one virus as a vector to deliver to a cell a nucleic acid coding for an antigen for another infectious agent. Viral vector vaccines do not cause infection with either the virus used as the vector, or the source of the antigen. The genetic material it delivers does not integrate into a person's genome.[1] Viral vector vaccines enable antigen expression within cells and induce a robust cytotoxic T cell response, unlike subunit vaccines which only confer humoral immunity. Most viral vectors are designed to be incapable of replication because the necessary genes are removed.[2] Adenovirus vectors have the advantage of high transduction efficiency, transgene expression, and broad viral tropism, and can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells. A disadvantage is that many people have pre-existing immunity to adenoviruses due to previous exposure. Human adenovirus serotype 5 is often used because it can be easily produced in high titers.[2] As of April 2021, four adenovirus vector vaccines for COVID-19 have been authorized in at least one country: Zabdeno, the first dose of the Zabdeno/Mvabea Ebola vaccine, is derived from human adenovirus serotype 26 expressing the glycoprotein of the Ebola virus Mayinga variant.[12] Both doses are non-replicating vectors and carry the genetic code of several Ebola virus proteins.[13] The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is an Ebola vaccine. It is a recombinant, replication-competent vaccine[15] consisting of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genetically engineered[16] so that the gene for the natural VSV envelope glycoprotein is replaced with that from the Kikwit 1995 Zaire strain Ebola virus.[17][18][19] Mvabea, the second dose of the Zabdeno/Mvabea Ebola vaccine, is a modified vaccinia Ankara vector, a type of poxvirus.[12] Both doses are non-replicating vectors and carry the genetic code of several Ebola virus proteins.[13] Other viruses that have been investigated as vaccine vectors include adeno-associated virus, retrovirus (including lentivirus), cytomegalovirus, Sendai virus, and avulavirus,[2][20] as well as influenza virus and measles virus.[1] Human clinical trials were conducted for viral vector vaccines against several infectious diseases including Zika virus, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV, and malaria, before the vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.[1] Two Ebola vaccines using viral vector technology were used in Ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2013\u20132016) and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018\u20132020).[1] The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2019,[21] and in the United States in December 2019.[22][23] Zabdeno/Mvabea was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2020.[13][24][25]","Title":"Viral vector vaccine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11141","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector_vaccine"}
