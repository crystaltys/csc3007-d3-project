{"Content: ":"The Parliament of South Ossetia is the unicameral legislature of the partially recognized Republic of South Ossetia. The 34 members of parliament are elected using a mixed system of Party-list proportional representation (17) and single-member districts (17). South Ossetia has a multi-party system, and currently 5 political parties are represented in parliament and has 6 independent MPs elected through single-member districts. The parliament is headed by a speaker, who is elected from among the members. The current speaker is Alan Tadtaev, member of parliament for United Ossetia. The parliament of South Ossetia meets in the capital Tskhinvali. The parliament building, built in 1937, was heavily damaged in the 2008 South Ossetia war.[1] Parliamentary elections were held in South Ossetia on 9 June 2019.[2] The ruling United Ossetia party lost its majority in parliament. Only three other elected members guaranteed their support if United Ossetia was to form a government, leaving it one seat short of a majority.[3]  Until 27 November 1996, the speaker (or \"chairman\") of the parliament was also Head of State.
