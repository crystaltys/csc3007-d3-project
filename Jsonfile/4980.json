Nearly two-thirds of the bonds issued by the State of Missouri from 1835 to 1860, plus a large share of securities of St. Louis, were sold through the house of Morgan \u2013 in all perhaps thirty million dollars worth. All the while the firm maintained its wholesale grocery trade.[2] In 1849, Morgan was elected as a member of the New York City Board of Assistant Aldermen.
