{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia is part of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus spread to Slovenia on 4 March 2020, when the first case was confirmed.[1] It was an imported case transmitted by a tourist traveling from Morocco via Italy, which was the center of the SARS-CoV-2 in Europe at the time.[2] The first few days of the pandemic were challenging for Slovenia due to the resignation of Prime Minister Marjan Šarec in late January and the formation of a new government. The first case in Slovenia was confirmed one day after Janez Janša was elected prime minister. During the transition period, the outbreak escalated. A joint meeting between the outgoing and incoming governments was held on 10 March 2020. Marjan Šarec's outgoing caretaker government was responsible for the crisis management until 14 March 2020.[citation needed] On 15 May 2020, Slovenia became the first European nation to declare the end of the COVID-19 epidemic within its territory.[3] Slovenia's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak was cited as a significant success when Europe faced the first wave of the pandemic, and earned praise for its effectiveness.[4] In May 2020, Vox listed Slovenia, together with Jordan, Greece, Iceland and Vietnam as among the most effective in handling of the coronavirus outbreak.[5] However, the government neglected second wave warnings from experts and did not properly prepare the health care sector to cope with the second wave, which spread out of control for the administration, even after more than three months of lockdown,[6] and in March 2021, Slovenia had the fourth highest death rate per capita in the world (according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University). As of 10 May 2022, 1,221,467 people in Slovenia have been fully vaccinated (around 57.9% of the population).[7] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[8][9] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[10][11] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[12][10]  As of 15 May 2020, Slovenia was the first country in Europe to declare that its epidemic was over (as of the end of May). As a result, some government support measures, such as financial aid to citizens and firms hit by the coronavirus, expired at the end of May.[60] In July, cases began to rise once again, and are no longer only coming from abroad.[61][62] On 3 July 2020, 30 new cases were reported, the highest number since 16 April 2020, suggesting the possibility of a second wave.[63] The labor committee approved a bill on intervention measures in preparation for the second wave, which provides the basis for an app for tracking infected people.[64] Second wave began and government issued a decree that wearing masks indoors is again mandatory.[65] After 21 September 2020 all shops, bars, clubs, restaurants and pubs had to be closed no later than at 22:00. The third wave began. Staff was abolished on 24 March 2020. Duties were transferred on responsible ministries.[citation needed]    ","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10635","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Slovenia"}
