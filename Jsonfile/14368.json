{"Content: ":"Gampaha electoral district was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989. The district was named after the city of Gampaha in present-day Gampaha District, Western Province. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts.[1] Gampaha electoral district was replaced by the Gampaha multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Gampaha continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.
