VGTRK Crimea started broadcasting on March 10, 2014. The editor-in-chief of the channel is Evgeny Bekasov (since 2012). The channel aspires to give a broad and impartial [2] outline of life in all of Russia\u2019s regions from its European exclave of Kaliningrad to Vladivostok in the Far East. The channel was named Vesti until 1 January 2010, when the public-owned VGTRK rebranded its channels. The channel was banned in Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the EU as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[3] The channel falsely claimed that the Bucha massacre was staged and suggested that footage of actors placing mannequins on a film set in St. Petersburg were Ukrainian soldiers using the mannequins to \"pass it off as a corpse\".[4] United Kingdom and Australia imposed sanctions against Evgeniy Poddubny, one of the top war correspondent and propagandist of Russia-24.[5] [6] First logo (as Vesti, 2006\u20132007) Second logo (as Vesti, 2007\u20132009) Тhird logo (2010\u20132011)","Title":"Russia-24 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16037","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia-24"}
