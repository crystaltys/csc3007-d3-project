She was close to Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party leader William Craig, but remained a member of the UUP.[1] In 1990 Steele was appointed as a Justice of the Peace (JP) for County Antrim. At the 1993 Northern Ireland local elections and 1997, Steele stood unsuccessfully for the UUP on Larne Borough Council.[2] She also stood in the Northern Ireland Forum election in East Antrim and was elected, although she lost her seat at the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election.[3] Despite this loss, and a reputation as a hardliner, she remained a prominent supporter of party leader David Trimble, and called for support of the Good Friday Agreement.[1] Steele devoted much of her time to the Ulster Women's Unionist Council, becoming Chairman of the organisation.[4] In the 2000 Birthday Honours, she received the MBE for political and public service.[5] At the 2016 UUP annual conference, the party leader Mike Nesbit made Steele honorary president of the party.[citation needed] Steele died on 8 January, 2020, at the age of 83.[6]","Title":"May Steele - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19166","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Steele"}
