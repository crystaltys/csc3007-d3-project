Welgama is quoted as saying, \"You are such a charming woman. I cannot explain my feelings here. But if you meet me outside Parliament, I will describe them \u2026 My thoughts are running riot \u2026 I don't want to reveal [them] to the public.\" Senanayake was unimpressed, saying, \"......As a woman you are not recognised as a person who has done so many portfolios, but always referred to as the beauty you were in your heyday. I consider that as a sexist remark.\"[13] Witnesses were appeared before Presidential Commission of Inquiry[14] that Rosy Senanayake had leaked some secret information of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in Parliament to the Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL).[15] Nuwan Salgado, the Chief Dealer of PTL, revealed at the Commission that Arjun Aloysius, the Chief Executive Officer of the PTL, had received a document in 2016 related to the COPE from Rosy's son, the son of Rosy Senanayake.[16] Rosy rejected the allegations stating that she was not a Member of Parliament at the time.[17]","Title":"Rosy Senanayake - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14137","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_Senanayake"}
