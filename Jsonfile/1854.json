{"Content: ":"The sagittal sulcus is a midline groove that runs across the internal surfaces of part of the squamous part of the frontal bone, the parietal bones,[1] and part of[citation needed] the occipital bones. The sagittal sulcus accommodates the superior sagittal sinus. The falx cerebri attaches to the edge of the sagittal sulcus[1] on either side.[citation needed] On the inferior portion of the squamous part of the frontal bone, the edges of the sagittal sinus converge to form a single midline ridge, the frontal crest (which also gives attachment to the falx cerebri).[1]  This human musculoskeletal system article is a stub.
