Documents issued by the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics have been valid in Russia since 2017. This allowed residents to work, travel, or study in Russia.[4] The head of state, Leonid Pasechnik made a deal with Russia to evacuate citizens to southern parts of Russia.[5] Ever since Russia has been establishing diplomatic relations with the LPR. Both sides have signed a treaty of friendship, cooperation, military aid and assistance.[6] Russia has given out more than 600,000 Russian passports to the citizens of the republics and has backed the rebels with guns and artillery. Russia also recognizes the Ukrainian-controlled areas as part of the rebels. Russia has also ordered troops to serve as peacekeepers in the separatist-held regions of the Donbas.

On March 27, 2022, the head of LPR Leonid Pasechnik announced plans to hold a referendum on joining Russian Federation.[7][8] This article about bilateral relations is a stub.
