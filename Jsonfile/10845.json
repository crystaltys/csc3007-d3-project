{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Norfolk Island is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Norfolk Island on December 30, 2021.[1] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[2] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[3] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[4] In March 2020, as a precautionary measure, the Norfolk Island Regional Council imposed a 32-day travel ban and declared a state of emergency. Administrator Eric Hutchinson stated that the measures were necessary due to the remote island's extremely limited health capacity.[5] Lockdown measures began to be lifted from 6 May 2020.[6] Following outbreaks in the Australian Eastern States and Territories in mid-2021, Norfolk islands implemented further restrictions. COVID-19 support packages were made available for Norfolk Island businesses and residents.[citation needed] COVID-19 was confirmed to have reached Norfolk Island on December 30, 2021.[7] Cases continued to spread in January 2022.
