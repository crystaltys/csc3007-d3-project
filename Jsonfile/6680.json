{"Content: ":"Frankfurter Rindswurst (German for \u201cFrankfurt beef sausage\u201d) is a sausage made of beef. It was introduced in 1894 by Frankfurt butcher Gref-Volsing to meet the demands of the growing Jewish population of the city and has since become one of its most famous delicacies.[1][2] The sausage may be boiled, broiled, or grilled. The best-known manufacturer is the Frankfurt company Gref-VÃ¶lsing [de].[3][4] The meat content of the sausage consists of 100% beef, with some lean meat being replaced by fat. For the production of the frankfurter, the coarsely ground meat is slowly minced for a short time in the grinder with nitrite curing salt and cutter aids. Then, fat and ice snow is added, and the chopping speed is increased until the mass is finely ground. Finally, it is seasoned with white pepper and paprika and color stabilizer is added if deemed necessary. The sausages are smoked for 60\u201390 minutes. They have a unit weight of 100 g and are cased in beef intestines with a diameter of 32\u201334 mm and are tied off. For the production of beef bratwurst, table salt is used instead of the nitrite curing salt. This German sausage\u2013related article is a stub.
