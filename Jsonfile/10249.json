{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on 14 February 2020, with the first confirmed case announced in Egypt.[2][3] The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February 2020.[4] Within three months, the virus had spread throughout the continent, as Lesotho, the last African sovereign state to have remained free of the virus, reported a case on 13 May 2020.[5][6] By 26 May, it appeared that most African countries were experiencing community transmission, although testing capacity was limited.[7] Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated.[8] In early June 2021, Africa faced a third wave of COVID infections with cases rising in 14 countries.[9] By 4 July the continent recorded more than 251,000 new Covid cases, a 20% increase from the prior week and a 12% increase from the January peak. More than sixteen African countries, including Malawi and Senegal, recorded an uptick in new cases.[10] The World Health Organization labelled it Africa's 'Worst Pandemic Week Ever'.[11] Many preventive measures have been implemented by different countries in Africa. These include travel restrictions, flight cancellations, event cancellations,[12] school closures, and border closures.[13] It is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in many African countries with less developed healthcare systems.[14] According to the autumn 2020 seroprevalence study in Juba in South Sudan, less than 1% of infected were actually reported.[15] Similar results were found in 2022 by WHO modelers.[16] New variants of concern of the virus were found in Africa: in February 2020 the Beta variant in South Africa,[17] in December 2020 the Eta variant in Nigeria,[18][19] and in November 2021 the Omicron variant in Botswana.[20] The African Union secured close to 300 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in the largest such agreement yet for Africa; it was announced on 13 January 2021. This is independent of the global Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (COVAX) effort aimed at distributing COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income countries.[21] Notably, however, African countries were being charged more than double what European countries had to pay for certain vaccines.[22] The Group of Seven (G-7) promised an equitable distribution of vaccines on 19 February 2021, although few details were provided.[23] The United Arab Emirates has also stepped forward as a vaccine provider for the continent.[24][25] Despite these breakthroughs, Africa is the world's least vaccinated continent.[26] At the beginning of June 2021 the World Health Organization reported that COVID-19 vaccine shipments had ground to a \"near halt\" in Africa.[27] On 8 June, the Sudanese-British billionaire philanthropist Mo Ibrahim sharply criticized the international community for failing to ensure equitable vaccine distribution across the globe.[28] By 8 July 2021, only 2% of the continent had been inoculated.[10] Several African governments are experiencing criticism for a perceived lack of readiness, corruption scandals, and forcing new lockdowns too late, undermining trust in the state. Currently, twenty of the 39 nations on the World Bank's harmonised list of fragile and conflict-affected states are in Africa.[29][30] To support the COVID-19 recovery, Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole would need to raise expenditure by around 6% of GDP ($100 billion), whereas MENA would need to boost spending by 9% of GDP.[31][32] By the second week of June 2020, Africa had surpassed 200,000 cases in total.[33] The number of confirmed new cases accelerated in June, with the continent having taken 98 days to record the first 100,000 cases, and 18 days for the second 100,000. The pace of acceleration has continued, with cases passing both the 300,000 and 400,000 marks on 6 July. On 8 July 2020, cases had exceeded half a million. Half of the 500,000 cases reported in the continent are from South Africa or Egypt.[34] Ten countries account for 80% of the reported cases.[34] The World Health Organization voiced alarm at the spread in Africa on 20 July 2020, stating that South Africa's surging numbers could be a precursor for further outbreaks across the continent.[35] The number exceeded a million by 6 August, with five countries making up over 75% of the total confirmed cases: South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia and Nigeria.[36] The true case numbers are believed to be significantly higher than the confirmed counts, due to low testing rates in many African countries.[37] The mortality rates of African countries, however, are relatively low compared to Europe due to the younger age of their populations.[36] On 21 August the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) expressed \"cautious optimism\" as the number of new cases took a downturn, while warning against complacency.[38] In some countries, the number of cases began to rise. On 29 October, John Nkengasong, the head of Africa CDC, said: \"The time to prepare for a second wave is truly now.\"[39] On 12 November, Africa CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that confirmed cases have been increasing since July, particularly in North Africa (Tunisia, Morocco and Libya). The curve has flattened in South Africa and Kenya, while Senegal and Equatorial Guinea have seen a steady decline.[40] During the summer of 2021, the number of cases increased and reached almost 202,000 a week by 27 June.[41] As of 13 July 2021, 22 of the 55 African states had reported cases of the Delta variant.[41] For the first time since the apex of the fourth wave generated by the Omicron strain, the weekly number of Covid-19 cases in Africa has \"significantly decreased,\" and the number of deaths has also decreased, according to a statement released by the World Health Organization on Thursday, 10 February 2022.[42] Daily cases for the most infected African countries: The number of active cases by country.[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54]   The first case in the country was confirmed on 25 February.

This is 17 deaths per one million population.[80] On 20 March, the first case in the country was confirmed, a 62-year-old from the United Kingdom.[81][82] The country's first case was announced on 14 March, with the patient being identified as a 74-year-old Italian man who returned to the Central African Republic from Milan, Italy.[83] On 19 March, the first case in the country was confirmed.[84] Over 4,000 people so far have tested positive[85] As a preventive measure, the government cancelled all flights into the country, except for cargo flights.[86][87] As a preventive measure, arriving travellers were to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival. To prevent the spread of the virus, the government has cancelled all incoming flights and banned large gatherings.[88] On 15 April 2020, a person arriving in Mayotte from the Comoros tested positive for COVID-19.[89] On 30 April, the first case was confirmed in the Comoros.[90] On 4 May, the first death was announced.[91] 54 people had been tested, and 53 contacts had been traced.[92] On 10 March, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the country.[93] As of March 2021, over 25,000 people had tested positive[94][95] As of 27 July 2021, the Delta variant had been detected in 76% of analyzed samples.[41] On 19 March, President Félix Tshisekedi announced that all flights would be suspended.[96] The president imposed a state of emergency and closed the borders.[97] Schools, bars, restaurants, and places of worship were also closed.

This is 81 deaths per one million population.[80] In January 2021, the relative of a 62-year-old COVID-19 patient who died in Egypt's El Husseineya Central Hospital due to the shortage of oxygen posted a video of the hospital on Facebook. The video that showed the medical staff in distress, resuscitating a man with the help of a manual ventilator went viral on the Internet, inviting global attention concerning the government's shortcomings in handling the pandemic. Four patients had died that day and the official statement issued by the hospital concluded that the patients suffered \"complications\", denying \"any connection\" of their deaths with the shortage of oxygen. An investigation led by the New York Times found otherwise in which statements given during interviews by both, the patients\u2019 relatives, as well as the medical staff, confirmed the cause of death as deprivation of oxygen.[102] Egypt began vaccinating healthcare workers on 24 January.

Currently, 220 million doses of the Janssen vaccine is in the process of being manufactured locally, with the country currently in phase 2 targeting mainly people over the age of 60 and frontline workers.[201][202][203][204] On 30 May, President Ramaphosa, addressed the nation announcing the tightening of restrictions from adjusted level lockdown 1 to 2.[205] This comes close to the recent sequencing of B.1.617.2 variant.[206][207][205] The third COVID-19 wave had taken hold.[208] On 5 April, the first case was confirmed.[209] Two cases COVID-19 were confirmed on 13 May in a crowded civilian protection camp in Juba. The camp houses 30,000 people.[210] The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the Canary Islands on 31 January 2020.[211][212] 2,275 confirmed cases and 151 deaths were reported as of 15 May 2020[update]. The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached in Ceuta on 13 March 2020.[213] The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached in Melilla on 10 March 2020.[213] As of 16 February 2021[update], 6,675 cases had been confirmed with 472 patients hospitalized, and 62 deaths.[214] The country's first case was announced on 13 March, a man who had died in Khartoum the previous day. He had visited the United Arab Emirates in the first week of March.[215] By 29 May, a surge of reported deaths in North Darfur raised fears of a serious outbreak in the region, although testing remains poor.[216] Sudan reported 25,730 total cases, 8,914 active cases, and 1,576 total deaths on 13 January 2021. This is 36 deaths per one million population.[80] On 16 March 2020, the first case was confirmed.[127] Tanzanian authorities stopped reporting case numbers in May.[217][218] The government announced in January 2021 that it had no plans in participate in vaccination projects encouraged by the WHO. The Catholic Church in Africa said it had observed an increase in Requiem masses and blamed funerals on an increase in COVID-19 infections.[219] On 17 February, Seif Sharif Hamad, 77, vice president of Zanzibar died of acute pneumonia related to COVID-19.[220] President John Magufuli died of a heart condition on 17 March, although many suspect it was COVID-19 related. Doctors expressed hope that the new president would bring positive change to the way the pandemic is addressed.[221] On 6 March 2020, the first case in the country was confirmed.[222] As of 17 February 2021[update], 5,953 confirmed cases, 5,094 recoveries, and 81 deaths had been reported.[223] On 2 March, the first case in the country was confirmed.[224][225] 168,568 total cases, 40,378 active cases, and 5,415 total deaths were reported on 13 January 2021 in Tunisia. This is a death rate of 456 per one million population.[80] On 20 March, the first case in Uganda was confirmed.[105][226][non-primary source needed] The first confirmed death was on 24 July.[227] Uganda reported 38,085 total cases, 24,698 active cases, and 304 total deaths on 13 January 2021. This is seven deaths per one million population.[80] As of 27 July 2021, the Delta variant had been detected in 97% of analyzed samples.[41] On 16 March three people who arrived by air to Ascension Island showed symptoms of COVID-19.[228] However, on 23 March it was announced that they had tested negative on 22 March[229] On 17 March all travel by air to the Saint Helena island was banned, except for island citizens or residents and similar cases.[230] There were no known cases on Saint Helena at this time.[231] On 16 March as a precaution the Tristan da Cunha Island Council on Tristan da Cunha made the decision to ban visitors to the island to prevent the potential transmission of the disease to islanders.[232] On 7 September 2020, the Ascension Island Government announced two weak positives cases,[233] subsequently tested negatives and confirmed as historical infection on 9 September.[234] The Ascension Island Government reported one other weak positive case on 16 November,[235] subsequently tested negative on 18 November[236] and a positive case in isolation on 24 December 2020.[237] The case was tested negative on 6 January 2021.[238] On 26 March 2021, a low positive case on a passenger arrived by flight on 24 March is reported by Saint Helena Health directorate.[239] The passenger was tested negative on 29 March 2021.[240] On 27 March 2021, Saint Helena government announced positive cases on a fishing vessel.[241][non-primary source needed] On 4 April, the first four cases in Moroccan-controlled part of Western Sahara were confirmed.[242] Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic reported its first cases on 25 July 2020.[243] Zambia reported its first 2 cases of COVID-19 on 18 March. The patients were a couple that had travelled to France on holiday.[244] A third case was recorded on 22 March. The patient was a man who had travelled to Pakistan.[245] On 25 March, President Edgar Lungu confirmed a total of 12 cases. He also announced measures which includes suspension of international flights Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe, Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula and Mfuwe International Airports and re-routing of all international flights to Kenneth Kaunda International Airport to facilitate screening of incoming passengers and mandatory quarantine where necessary, closure of all bars, nightclubs, casinos, cinemas and gyms and restriction of all public gatherings to 50 people or less.[246] By 17 March, the government had shut all educational institutions and put in place some restrictions on foreign travel.[247] On 19 August, the Vice President of Zambia Inonge Wina tested positive for COVID-19.[248] Zambia reported 31,100 total cases, 9,023 active cases, and 509 total deaths on 13 January 2021. This is 27 deaths per one million population.[80] Before there were any confirmed cases in the country, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had declared a national emergency, putting in place travel restrictions and banning large gatherings.[249][250] The country's defence minister Oppah Muchinguri caused controversy by stating the coronavirus could be a divine punishment on Western nations for imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe.[251] Its first case was reported on 21 March: it was a male resident of Victoria Falls who travelled from the United Kingdom via South Africa on 15 March.[252] Police report that 105,000 have been arrested for violating health measures between March and July, including 1,000 arrests for not wearing facemasks on 18 and 19 July.[253] Zimbabwe reported 24,256 total cases, 10,009 active cases, and 589 total deaths on 13 January 2021. This is 39 deaths per one million population.[80] Corruption is alleged to exist within the public vaccination program, with priority for receiving vaccines being given to those willing to pay bribes to hospital staff, and members of Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU-PF. Vaccines are reportedly available within the private health care system at a cost of approximately US$40.[254] As of 18 January 2021[update] there had been two cases in Diego Garcia, followed by three arrivals in April 2021 who subsequently tested positive during their 14-day quarantine. Access to the islands, already heavily restricted due to the presence of a military base on Diego Garcia, have been further curtailed, with licenses for visiting vessels suspended.[255] All people arriving into the territory are subject to a 14-day quarantine; social distancing measures have also been enacted.[256] COVID-19 vaccination programs have begun in many countries and territories in Africa. In June 2021, the World Health Organization predicted that 47 of Africa's 54 nations would fall short of the aim of vaccinating 10% of their people by September 2021. In June, Africa accounted for fewer than 1% of worldwide vaccine doses delivered.[257][258][259][260] Africa received in total less than 2% of the 3 billion vaccination doses provided globally. [261][262] As of 5 July 2021, vaccination campaigns had started in 51 African countries with 36.5 million people receiving at least one dose.[263] On 15 July 2021, WHO Africa's coordinator for immunization and vaccines development reported that African nations had destroyed some 450,000 vaccine doses due to their expiry dates. He cited Malawi, South Sudan, Liberia, Mauritania, Gambia, Sierra Leone,[264] Guinea, Comoros and the Democratic Republic of Congo as examples.[265] Also in July 2021, the European Investment Bank committed to fund Senegal's first COVID-19 vaccine production factory, at Institut Pasteur de Dakar. By the end of 2022, this factory is expected to manufacture up to 25 million doses of a licensed COVID-19 vaccine per month. This is part of a wide effort by the European Investment Bank to address the health and economic impact of COVID-19.[266][267][268] Meanwhile, BioNTech and the European Union are collaborating to assess mRNA vaccine production facilities in Rwanda and Senegal.[269][270][271][272] Experts have worried about COVID-19 spreading to Africa, because many of the healthcare systems on the continent are inadequate, having problems such as lack of equipment, lack of funding, insufficient training of healthcare workers, and inefficient data transmission. It was feared that the pandemic could be difficult to keep under control in Africa, and could cause huge economic problems if it spread widely.[273][8] The pandemic has had a serious economic impact in African countries, damaging the continent's growing middle class and threatening to increase the rates of poverty and extreme poverty.[274] On 23 June 2021, researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Africa Research, Implementation Science and Education (ARISE) Network published six studies on the impact of the virus and control measures on nutrition, health, and areas of existing inequities.[275] Their findings included food price increases, disrupted schooling, and a disruption in health care services.[275] Previous research found that crowding out grew from 2014 to 2018, reaching high levels in a number of countries, including Ghana, Niger, Tanzania, and Zambia. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Africa's debt accumulation between 2008 and 2017 resulted in increasing public debt on bank balance sheets, higher interest rates on sovereign paper in several African nations, and collapsing banks. Given the enormous growth in indebtedness across Africa in 2020, there is a definite possibility of this cycle recurring, impeding recovery from the pandemic.[276][277] COVID-19 Enterprise survey follow-up modules were conducted in nine African nations between 2020 and 2021, producing results consistent with a severe economic effect.[278][279] Around 88% of enterprises in countries where COVID-19 follow-up surveys were conducted (three in Southern Africa, one in East Africa, four in West Africa, and one in North Africa) were suffering diminished liquidity, with more than 55% of them closing temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 8% had declared bankruptcy, and 26% of enterprises are past due on financial institution commitments. Firms that depend on equity are at 36%. Rather than depending on commercial bank loans to address cash flow issues, these are more likely to succeed at 16%. [278] As of 18 April 2020[update], the supply of ventilators was low in much of Africa: 41 countries had only 2,000 ventilators between them, and ten countries had no ventilators at all. Even basic supplies like soap and water are subject to shortages in parts of the continent.[280] The United Nations reported that at least 74 million test kits and 30,000 ventilators were needed for the continent's 1.3 billion people in 2020.[281] The World Health Organization (WHO) helped many countries on the continent set up laboratories for COVID-19 testing.[273] Matshidiso Moeti of the WHO said: \"We need to test, trace, isolate and treat\".[61] Experts say that experience battling Ebola helped some countries prepare for COVID-19.[273][282][283] The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme has been leveraged for surveillance and case-finding.[284] Molecular testing has been scaled up across the continent using existing disease surveillance programs such as those for HIV, drug-resistant tuberculosis and Lassa fever.[284] Pooled testing to expedite processing times has been pioneered in countries such as Ghana.[284][285] Key leadership has been provided at country and regional level by public health institutes such as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, the five regional Centres for Disease Control, and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has worked to support the response across the continent and distributed tests donated by the Jack Ma Foundation.[286] The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and COVID-19 Africa Open Data Project[287] have collected and reported continent-wide data on the number of cases, recoveries and deaths. The COVID-19 Africa Open Data Project provides additional data on healthcare workers infected, health services, urgent needs and local laboratories.[288] Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention director John Nkengasong warned on 10 December that Africa might not see vaccines until after the second quarter of 2021. Separately, Richard Mihigo of the World Health Organization warned against inequality in access to COVID-19 vaccines.[289] In Egypt, the poverty rate as of February 2021[update] stood at 29.7 percent, i.e., 30.5 million people. Nevertheless, the authorities were reported to be charging between 100 and 200 EGP (Egyptian Pounds) for a double dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca. As per the economic conditions in Egypt, two doses of the vaccine were said to exhaust about 13 to 27 percent of the monthly income for people living just above the poverty line. According to unofficial estimates, about 60,000 people died in Egypt between May 2020 and July 2020, due to COVID-19.[290] Innovative uses of technology in health and other sectors such as drone delivery of test kits to isolated areas have been piloted.[284] The European Investment Bank committed \u20ac5 billion in new private and public investment throughout Africa in 2020 to assist in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as addressing the economic consequences of the crisis.[30][291][292] 71% of the funds were for the least developed economies. The overall finance will end up supporting more than \u20ac12 billion in projects in 28 African countries. This financial support is estimated to help 210 million people be vaccinated against COVID-19, 595,400 homes to receive new electricity, 778,000 people getting a safer water supply. Farmers will also benefit from 26,500 hectares of freshly irrigated land and 3,076 hectares of newly planted forest.[30] A lasting sustainable recovery from COVID-19 would need an extra $1 trillion in yearly investment for poor countries, on top of the $2.5 trillion annual funding shortfall for the pre-crisis Sustainable Development Goals.[30][293][294][295] In March 2020, Matshidiso Moeti of the World Health Organization said that hand washing and physical distancing could be challenging in some places in Africa. It was thought that lockdown may not be possible, and challenges may be exacerbated by the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, AIDS, tuberculosis, and cholera.[273] However, by May, at lest 42 African countries had imposed partial or full lockdowns.[296] Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimize lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned per day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Additionally, there is an increased risk of famine in several African nations.[297] Many preventive measures have been implemented in different countries in Africa, including travel restrictions, flight cancellations, event cancellations,[282] school closures, and border closures.[298] Social influencers and celebrities have joined voices with public health experts urging people to practice social distancing.[284] Other measures to contain and limit the spread of the virus have included curfews, lockdowns, and enforcing the wearing of face masks.[284] Local businesses have financially supported response efforts and initiated the manufacture of masks and hand sanitizers.[284] There have been significant efforts to combat COVID-19 disinformation and provide accurate information to support the response to COVID-19.[284][299] The \"Verified\" social media initiative of the United Nations used \"information volunteers\" to help debunk false claims about vaccine trials and fake cures.[299] UNESCO #DontGoViral initiative crowdsourced culturally relevant, open-sourced information in local languages.[299] The communications agency 35-North partnered with the COVID-19 Africa Open Data Project to combat misinformation through Telegram and WhatsApp.[300] It also raised the question of public policy and trust in Africa's governments and elsewhere and challenge them in many different aspects.[301] Template:COVID-19 pandemic","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Africa - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10249","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Africa"}
