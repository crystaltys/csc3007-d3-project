Administratively, it is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Until 2016, it also served as the administrative center of Lyman Raion, though it was not a part of the raion. It still serves as the center of Lyman hromada.[2][3] Population: 20,469 (2021 est.)[4]; 28,172 (2001). In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Moscow tsar Peter I, Lyman was explicitly mentioned as one of the towns included to Azov Governorate.[5][6] The town obtained the prefix Krasnyi (Red) in 1925 in the process of USSR creation. In June 2014, the city was the scene of the battle of Krasnyi Lyman during the War in Donbas.[7] On 5 June the town returned to Ukrainian control.[8] Following the 2015 law on decommunization the city was renamed from Krasnyi Lyman to Lyman.[9] The new name was approved by the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) on 4 February 2016.[9] Lyman is an important railway junction. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lyman was seized following a battle on the city by Russian troops on 27 May.[10][11] As of the 2001 Ukrainian census:[12]  This article about a location in Donetsk Oblast is a stub.
