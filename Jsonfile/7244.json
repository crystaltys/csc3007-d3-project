{"Content: ":"Montenegro has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 12 times since its debut in 2007. Previously it had participated as part of Yugoslavia (both the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1991 and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992) and as part of Serbia and Montenegro (from 2004 to 2006). The 2005 entrants from Serbia and Montenegro, No Name, were from Montenegro, as were the 1983 and 1984 entrants for Yugoslavia. As of 2022, Montenegro has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest 12 times since debuting in 2007, and has qualified for the final twice. Before Montenegro became an independent country on 3 June 2006, the country had participated as part of Yugoslavia and later Serbia and Montenegro. Entries from Montenegro also placed 4th in 1983 and 18th in 1984 as part of Yugoslavia, and 7th in 2005 as part of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegrin broadcaster Radio and Television of Montenegro (RTCG) organised the national final MontenegroSong to select the country's entries in 2007 and 2008, and internally selected the entry in 2009. As an independent country, Montenegro failed to qualify for the grand final during its debut in 2007, as well as its appearances in 2008 and 2009. The country placed 11th in the first semi-final in 2009, their best result at the time, with \"Just Get Out of My Life\" performed by Andrea Demirović. In November 2009, RTCG announced that Montenegro would withdraw from the 2010 contest due to financial difficulties.[1] Despite not participating, RTCG still broadcast the contest.[citation needed] RTCG applied to participate in the 2011 contest, but with the caveat that the potential representative would have to find sponsors to fund their participation themselves.[2] As that did not come to fruition, in December 2010, Montenegro decided to not participate in the contest on financial grounds.[3] On 20 November 2011 the head of RTCG revealed that Montenegro would participate in the 2012 contest to be held in Baku; he also went on to say that he saw Montenegro at every Eurovision Song Contest to come.[4] Montenegro returned to the contest in 2012, again internally selecting their entry, \"Euro Neuro\" performed by Rambo Amadeus, which failed to qualify from the first semi-final. In 2014, Montenegro qualified for the grand final for the first time in its history with Sergej Ćetković's \"Moj svijet\". In 2015, Montenegro again qualified for the grand final with \"Adio\", performed by Knez and composed by Željko Joksimović. The song achieved the best Montenegrin result up to that time, finishing in 13th place. In 2016, RTCG selected Highway and their song \"The Real Thing\" internally. They performed in the first semi-final but the song failed to qualify, placing 13th with 60 points. In 2017, RTCG selected Slavko Kalezić and his song \"Space\" internally. The song failed to qualify, placing 16th. In 2018, RTCG organised the national final Montevizija to select their entry,[5] which was won by \"Inje\" performed by Vanja Radovanović.[6] The song failed to qualify from the second semi-final, placing 16th with 40 points. In 2019, RTCG again selected its representative through Montevizija,[7] which was won by \"Heaven\" performed by D mol.[8] The song failed to qualify from the first semi-final, placing 16th with 46 points. Despite initially confirming their participation in the 2020 contest and aiming to expand Montevizija,[9][10] Montenegro ultimately did not enter the contest, which was later cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[11] RTCG later stated that the reason was due to \"modest results\" and financial issues.[12] Montenegro also did not participate in the 2021 contest, but returned in 2022, having internally selected Vladana to represent the country with the song \"Breathe\".[13][14] Once again, Montenegro failed to qualify for the final, finishing 17th in a field of 18 with 33 points in the second semi-final. Prior to Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution, artists from the Montenegrin federal unit represented Yugoslavia in 1983, 1984, and Serbia and Montenegro as a republic unit in 2005, as well as being intended to compete in 2006, where they withdrew. The Barbara Dex Award is an annually awarded, fan-voted accolade for the \"worst dressed\" artists in the Eurovision Song Contest.[15] The public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event. The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the contestants, songwriters, composers and backing vocalists, among others.[17] Stevan Faddy in Helsinki (2007) Stefan Filipović in Belgrade (2008) Andrea Demirović in Moscow (2009) Rambo Amadeus in Baku (2012) Who See in Malmö (2013) Sergej Ćetković in Copenhagen (2014) Knez in Vienna (2015) Highway in Stockholm (2016) Slavko Kalezić in Kyiv (2017) Vanja Radovanović in Lisbon (2018) D mol in Tel Aviv (2019) Vladana in Turin (2022)","Title":"Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7244","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest"}
