A significant part of ATO zone is considered temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.[7] On 20 February 2018, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko changed the status of the ATO zone from an anti-terrorist operation to \u201ctaking measures to ensure national security and defense, and repulsing and deterring the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts\".[8] This allows the Ukrainian military to take charge of the zones instead of the Ukrainian secret service SBU.[citation needed] As such, the ATO was renamed to JFO zone (Joint Forces Operation (Ukrainian: Операція об'єднаних сил, ООС, romanized: Operatsiya ob'yednanykh syl).[9] The zone is conditionally divided into five sectors A, B, C, D, and M.[10][11] Information as of 7 November 2014. or landmark location або орієнтир на місцевості [12] Since 28 December 2015, the song \"Brattia Ukraintsi\" (Brothers Ukrainians) is the official anthem of ATO.[13] ","Title":"Anti-terrorist Operation Zone - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16464","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Terrorist_Operation_Zone_(Ukraine)"}
