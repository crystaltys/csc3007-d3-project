On May 1, 2017, its chairman emeritus Dante Arevalo Ang was appointed by Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as special envoy of the President for international public relations.[2] The Manila Times was founded by Thomas Gowan, an Englishman who had been living in the Philippines. The paper was created to serve mainly the Americans who were sent to Manila to fight in the Spanish\u2013American War. At the time, most of the newspapers in the Philippines were in Spanish and a few others were in the native languages. Shortly after the paper's founding, reports reached Manila about the Paris Conference that would lead to the treaty ceding the Philippines to the United States from Spain.[1] The first issue of The Manila Times on October 11, 1898 had a sheet of two leaves, or four pages, measuring about 12 by 8 inches, each page divided into two columns. The first page was taken up by announcements and advertisements. Page 2 was the editorial page. It contained the editorials and the more important news of the day. Page 3 was devoted to cable news from Europe and the United States all bearing on the Spanish\u2013American War.[1] In 1899, George Sellner acquired The Manila Times from Gowan, who joined the paper as business manager.[1] In 1902, an American businessman acquired The Manila Times, reacquired by Sellner in 1905.[1] In 1907, Thomas C.
