Many of them tested positive for the coronavirus when they arrived, and were quarantined. Bihar's COVID case fatality rate is one of the lowest in the nation.[5] The recovery rate in the state, 76, is also better than the national average. Starting from mid-August, cases slowly started to drop,[7] and the state re-opened by early-March.[8][9] However, after Holi on 29 March 2021, cases started to rise quickly again, the government imposed new restrictions on 3 April 2021,[10] and tightened them on April 9, 2021.[11] On April 11, 2021, Bihar reported 3,756 new cases and 12 deaths.

The other reasons was that most of these camps operated out of schools, which needed to be vacated as the government planned to reopen schools in July.[25] As of 14 June, there were 288 Block Quarantine Camps with a total of 15,33,392 persons registered for quarantining.[26] While operational, these camps provided three meals a day to them, as well as a minimum financial assistance of \u20b91,000.[26] To combat rapid population growth, the state government also provided kits containing condoms, contraceptives, and pregnancy tests to the discharged migrants.[27] As of 10 June, 17 lakh condoms were distributed to the migrants.[28] Bihar is one of the 15 states and Union Territories which will get technical support and administrative hand-holding from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through central teams composed of two public health experts, epidemiologists, clinicians and a senior Joint Secretary level nodal officer.[29] The central team will assist the health department of the state government in implementing containment measures and management of clinical cases.
