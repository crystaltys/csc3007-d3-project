If there are multiple candidates, the executive board of the WHO \u2014 a panel of members from 34 member countries representing the various WHO regions \u2014 interviews the nominees.[6] The term of the Director-General lasts for five years. Office holders can be and have been appointed for multiple subsequent terms, such as Marcolino Gomes Candau who served for four consecutive terms.
