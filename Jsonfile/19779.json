George Kiraz was born in Bethlehem to a Syriac Orthodox merchant family which traces its roots back to Elazığ in Anatolia. He learned Syriac at Monastery of Saint Mark, Jerusalem. In 1983 he emigrated with his family to the United States where they settled in Los Angeles.[2] He holds numerous degrees including a B.Sc. degree in Engineering from California State University in 1990, a master's degree in Syriac Studies from University of Oxford in 1991, a master's degree in computer speech and language processing, and a Ph.D. degree in computational linguistics from University of Cambridge in 1992 and 1996 respectively.[2] In 1986, he designed the first computer fonts for Syriac and established a one-person company in Los Angeles named Alaph Beth Computer Systems for their distribution. He developed the proposal for encoding Syriac in Unicode (with Paul Nelson and Sargon Hasso) and designed the Unicode compliant Meltho fonts which enable Syriac computing on modern computers. His fonts are by far the most popular Computer Syriac fonts used in modern days.[2] He has been involved in Syriac related projects such as the co-founding of Gorgias Press, a publishing house dedicated to Syriac studies and other subjects in the humanities,[3] and directing the institute of Beth Mardutho,[3] which seeks to promote Syriac heritage and language. Between 1996 and 2000, he worked at Bell Labs as a member of technical staff in the Language Modeling Group.[4] Between 2000 and 2001 he was instrumental in opening an office for Nuance Communications on Wall Street, New York. His research interests include finite-state technology, computational morphology and phonology, and Syriac studies. He is married to Christine Kiraz. They live with their three children in Piscataway, New Jersey. Kiraz has published a number of books about the Syriac language, and co-authored many others: He is directing the Antioch Bible project. As of 2014, he has published over 40 papers in the fields of computational linguistics and Syriac studies. Kiraz is a deacon in the Syriac Orthodox Church. He was consecrated and anointed a reader (Syriac Qoruyo) in Bethlehem on February 6, 1977 by the laying on of the hands of Mor Dioscoros Luqa Sha'ya, then Metropolitan of Jerusalem.
