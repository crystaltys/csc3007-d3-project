{"Content: ":"On 20 February 2020, stock markets across the world suddenly crashed after growing instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It ended on 7 April 2020. Beginning on 13 May 2019, the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities inverted,[1] and remained so until 11 October 2019, when it reverted to normal.[2] Through 2019, while some economists (including Campbell Harvey and former New York Federal Reserve economist Arturo Estrella) argued that a recession in the following year was likely,[3][4] other economists (including the managing director of Wells Fargo Securities Michael Schumacher and San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary C. Daly) argued that inverted yield curves may no longer be a reliable recession predictor.[5][2] The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries would not invert again until 30 January 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,[6][7] four weeks after local health commission officials in Wuhan, China announced the first 27 COVID-19 cases as a viral pneumonia strain outbreak on 1 January.[8] The curve did not return to normal until 3 March when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points.[9][10] In noting decisions by the FOMC to cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points three times between 31 July and 30 October 2019,[11][12][13] on 25 February 2020, former U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs Nathan Sheets suggested that the attention of the Federal Reserve to the inversion of the yield curve in the U.S. Treasuries market when setting monetary policy may be having the perverse effect of making inverted yield curves less predictive of recessions.[14] During 2019, the IMF reported that the world economy was going through a 'synchronized slowdown', which entered into its slowest pace since the Great Recession. Weakness was exhibited in the consumer market as global markets began to suffer through a 'sharp deterioration' of manufacturing activity. Global growth was believed to have peaked in 2017, when the world's total industrial sector output began to start a sustained decline in early 2018. The IMF blamed 'heightened trade and geopolitical tensions' as the main reason for the slowdown, citing Brexit and the China \u2013 United States trade war as primary reasons for slowdown in 2019, while other economists blamed liquidity issues.[15][16] The crash caused a short-lived bear market, and in April 2020 global stock markets re-entered a bull market, though U.S. market indices did not return to January 2020 levels until November 2020.[17][18][19][20][21] The crash signaled the beginning of the COVID-19 recession. The 2020 stock market crash followed a decade of economic prosperity and sustained global growth after recovery from the Great Recession. Global unemployment was at its lowest in history, whilst quality of life was generally improving across the world. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, the most impactful pandemic since the Spanish flu, began decimating the economy.[22] Global economic shutdowns occurred due to the pandemic, and panic buying and supply disruptions exacerbated the market. The International Monetary Fund had pointed to other mitigating factors seen pre-pandemic, such as a global synchronized slowdown in 2019, as exacerbants to the crash, especially given that the market was already vulnerable.[23][24][25][15][26][27] Though the crash began on 20 February, selling was intensified during the first half of March to mid-March. During the crash, there were multiple severe daily drops in the global stock market, the largest drop was on 16 March, nicknamed 'Black Monday II' of 12\u201313% in most global markets.[28][29][30] There were two other significant dates of crashes in the stock markets, one being 9 March, nicknamed 'Black Monday I',[31][32][33] and on 12 March, nicknamed 'Black Thursday'.[34][35] To deal with the panic, banks and reserves across the world cut their interest rates, bank rates and cash flow rates, as well as offering unprecedented support to investors and markets.[36][37][38] On Monday, 17 February 2020, Asia-Pacific stock markets closed down but European stock markets closed up,[40][41] while U.S. stock markets were closed in observance of Presidents Day.[42] Oil prices fell,[43] while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.59%.[44] On 18 February, Asia-Pacific stock markets closed up,[45] while European stock markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite, and S&P 500 all closed down.[46][47] Oil prices rose by more than 2%,[48] while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.54% and 1.99%.[49] Singaporean Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a $4.5 billion fiscal stimulus program.[50] On 19 February, Asia-Pacific and European stock markets closed mostly up,[51][52] while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up and the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 finished at record highs.[53] Oil prices rose by another 2%,[54] while yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.56% and 2.00% respectively.[55] The People's Bank of China and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey cut their repo rates by 10 and 50 basis points respectively,[56][57] while the Central Bank of Argentina cut its bank rate by 400 basis points.[58] On 20 February, stock markets worldwide closed mostly down,[59][60][61] while oil prices fell by 1% and yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.51% and 1.96% respectively.[62][63] Bank Indonesia cut its overnight rate by 25 basis points,[64] while the Central Bank of Brazil announced it would cut its reserve requirement on 16 March from 31% to 25%, which is expected to release R$135 billion (or $29 billion) into the money supply.[65][66] On 21 February, stock markets worldwide closed down on the day (with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite, and S&P 500 closing down on the week),[67][68][69] while oil prices fell and yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.45% and 1.89% respectively (with the 30-year finish being an all-time low).[70][71] On Monday, 24 February 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and FTSE 100 dropped more than 3% as the coronavirus outbreak spread worsened substantially outside China over the weekend.[72] This follows benchmark indices falling sharply in continental Europe after steep declines across Asia.[73][74] The DAX, CAC 40 and IBEX 35 each fell by about 4% and the FTSE MIB fell over 5%.[75][76] There was a large fall in the price of oil and a large increase in the price of gold, to a 7-year high.[77][78] Yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.36% and 1.81% respectively.[79] On 25 February, stock markets worldwide closed down,[80][81][82] while oil prices fell to their lowest level in more than a year and the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to new record lows of 1.31% and 1.80% respectively.[83][84] Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani announced a $742 million fiscal stimulus program.[85] On 26 February, stock markets worldwide finish with mixed records,[86][87][88] while oil prices fell for the fourth session in a row while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell 1.30% and 1.80% respectively.[89][90] The Bank of Korea declined to cut its overnight rate.[91] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the COVID-19 pandemic, stock markets in Asia-Pacific and Europe saw 3\u20135% declines,[92][93] with the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting their sharpest falls since 2008 (and the Dow falling 1,191 points, its largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008).[94] Oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a year,[95] while yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.28% and 1.77% respectively.[96] European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde indicated that while the European Central Bank was monitoring the outbreak, it was not yet causing a long-term impact on inflation and thus did not yet require a monetary policy response.[97] On 28 February, stock markets worldwide reported their largest single-week declines since the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008,[17][98][99] while oil futures saw their largest single week decline since 2009 and the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to new record lows at 1.12% and 1.30% respectively.[100][101] Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney stated that the British economy (which saw stagnation and car manufacturing declines in the 4th quarter of 2019) was being impacted by the outbreak because it relies heavily on tourism revenues and international manufacturing supply lines.[102] Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the outbreak was posing \"evolving risks to economic activity\" and that the Federal Reserve would use monetary policy to \"act as appropriate to support the economy\" but that \"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\"[103] Outgoing Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced a RM20 billion fiscal stimulus package.[104] Ultimately, from 24 to 28 February, stock markets globally plummeted several percentage points, while on Wall Street the indices were down at least 10%.[105] It was the fastest correction in market history from all-time high, taking merely six days to enter into correction territory.[106] The sudden drop in late February was attributed to fears that China could produce a global economic shock, primarily due to quarantines imposed by the state to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which at the time was classified as an epidemic.[107] Within weeks, stocks fell sufficiently enough to enter bear market territory.[108] Concerning reports of the viruses spread in South Korea, Italy and Iran also prompted fear in investors, mounting to a mass sell-off in Asia-Pacific stock markets as well as European ones.[109] Over the preceding weekend, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated that the Bank of Japan would \"strive to stabilise markets and offer sufficient liquidity via market operations and asset purchases\",[110] and the Bank of Japan subsequently announced that it would repurchase up to ¥500 billion ($4.6 billion) worth of government bonds.[111] On Monday 2 March, European and Asia-Pacific stock markets mostly ended the previous week's consecutive daily losses,[112][113] while in the United States, the S&P 500 gained 3.9%, the NASDAQ Composite gained 3.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1,126 points up (or 4.4%; its largest one-day gain since 2009).[114] Oil futures saw their largest daily gain of 2020,[115] while yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.03% and 1.62% respectively.[116] On 3 March, the finance ministers and central bank executives of the G7 countries released a joint statement to \"reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools\" to address the socioeconomic impact of the outbreak including \"fiscal measures where appropriate\" with the central banks continuing to \"fulfill their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth.\"[117] On the same day, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Central Bank of Malaysia announced overnight rate cuts of 25 basis points (which brought the Australian rate to its lowest level in history),[118] Bank Indonesia announced it would cut its reserve requirement from 8 to 4 percent starting on 16 March,[119] while the People's Bank of China declined to conduct open market operations.[120] South Korean Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki announced a \u20a911.7 trillion ($9.8 billion) fiscal stimulus program.[121] Also on 3 March, due to the Bank of Mexico declining to cut its overnight rate further,[122] Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera Gutiérrez announced a fiscal stimulus program to accelerate government spending.[123] The Federal Open Market Committee lowered the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points with Federal Reserve Chair Powell stating that the central bank \"saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act\" and that \"the magnitude and persistence of the overall effect [of the outbreak] on the U.S. economy remain highly uncertain\".[9][124] At the close of trading on 3 March, European and Asia-Pacific stock markets had mostly risen,[118][125] but the S&P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell (with the Dow reversing more than two-thirds of the previous day's gain).[126] Oil futures rose and the yield on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to record lows of 0.91% and 1.60% respectively (with the fall below 1% on the 10-year securities occurring for the first time in history).[127][128] On 4 March, Asia-Pacific and European stock markets continued mostly rising (with the KOSPI alone rising by 2%),[129][130] while the S&P 500 rose by 4.2%, the NASDAQ Composite rose by 3.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed the previous day's loss by rising by 1,173 points (or 4.5%).[131] However, oil futures fell and the yield on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities finished at 0.99% and 1.64% respectively.[132][133] The Bank of Canada and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority announced 50 basis point cuts to their overnight and repo rates respectively,[134][135] International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva announced a $50 billion emergency credit-line program to assist low-income and emerging market countries with policy responses to the epidemic,[136][137] and the Central Bank of Brazil announced that it would auction up to $1 billion in foreign exchange swaps.[138] On 5 March, Asia-Pacific stock markets continued rising while European stock markets closed down.[139][140] The S&P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell by more than 3%.[141] Oil futures rose following reports of OPEC agreeing to production cuts with Russia,[142] while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 0.91% and 1.54% respectively.[143] The Central Bank of Argentina cut its bank rate by an additional 200 basis points,[144] and after declining to cut its overnight rate on 27 February,[145] the Bank of Korea renewed a currency swap agreement with Bank Indonesia.[146] On 6 March, stock markets worldwide closed down (although the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite, and S&P 500 closed up on the week).[147][148][149] Oil prices fell by 9% (the largest one-day price drop in 11 years),[150] while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to new record lows under 0.71% and 1.22% respectively.[151] U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an emergency appropriations and pandemic countermeasures bill including $8.3 billion in government spending.[152] The reduction in the demand for travel and the lack of factory activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted demand for oil, causing its price to fall.[153] In mid-February, the International Energy Agency forecast that oil demand growth in 2020 would be the smallest since 2011.[154] Chinese demand slump resulted in a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss a potential cut in production to balance the loss in demand.[155] The cartel initially made a tentative agreement to cut oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day following a meeting in Vienna on 5 March 2020, which would bring production levels to the lowest since the Iraq War.[156] After OPEC and Russia failed to agree on oil production cuts on 6 March and Saudi Arabia and Russia both announced increases in oil production on 7 March, oil prices fell by 25 percent.[157][158] On 8 March, Saudi Arabia unexpectedly announced that it would increase production of crude oil and sell it at a discount (of $6\u20138 a barrel) to customers in Asia, the US, and Europe, following the breakdown of negotiations as Russia resisted calls to cut production. The biggest discounts targeted Russian oil customers in northwestern Europe.[159] Prior to the announcement, the price of oil had gone down by more than 30% since the start of the year, and upon Saudi Arabia's announcement it dropped a further 30 percent, though later recovered somewhat.[160][161] Brent Crude, used to price two-thirds of the world's crude oil supplies, experienced the largest drop since the 1991 Gulf War on the night of 8 March. Also, the price of West Texas Intermediate fell to its lowest level since February 2016.[162] Former George W. Bush administration energy policy advisor Bob McNally noted, \"This is the first time since 1930 and '31 that a massive negative demand shock has coincided with a supply shock;\"[163] in that case it was the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act precipitating a collapse in international trade during the Great Depression, coinciding with discovery of the East Texas Oil Field during the Texas oil boom. Fears of the Russian\u2013Saudi Arabian oil price war caused a plunge in U.S. stocks, and have had a particular impact on American producers of shale oil.[164] Prior to opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures market experienced a 1,300-point drop based on the coronavirus and fall in the oil price described above, triggering a trading curb, or circuit breaker, that caused the futures market to suspend trading for 15 minutes.[31][32][165][33] Over the previous weekend, on 8 March, the TA-35 and TA-125 Indices of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange fell by 4.5% and 4.7% respectively,[166] entering bear markets from their 19 February peaks.[list 1] The United States' Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 2000 points,[171] described by The News International as \"the biggest ever fall in intraday trading.\"[172] The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a number of trading \"circuit breakers\" to curb panicked selling.[31] Oil firms Chevron and ExxonMobil fell about 15%.[173] The NASDAQ Composite, also in the United States, lost over 620 points.[clarification needed] The S&P 500 fell by 7.6%.[174] Oil prices fell 22%,[175] and the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell below 0.40% and 1.02% respectively.[176] Canada's S&P/TSX Composite Index finished the day off by more than 10%.[177] Brazil's IBOVESPA gave up 12%, erasing over 15 months of gains for the index.[178] Australia's ASX 200 lost 7.3% \u2013 its biggest daily drop since 2008,[179][180] though it rebounded later in the day. London's FTSE 100 lost 7.7%, suffering its worst drop since the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008.[181][182] BP and Shell Oil experienced intraday price drops of nearly 20%[183] The FTSE MIB, CAC 40, and DAX tanked as well, with Italy affected the most as the COVID-19 pandemic in the country continues. They fell 11.2%, 8.4%, and 7.9% respectively.[184][185][186] The STOXX Europe 600 fell to more than 20% below its peak earlier in the year.[187] In a number of Asian markets\u2014Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia\u2014shares declined over 20% from their most recent peaks, entering bear market territory.[188] In Japan, the Nikkei 225 plummeted 5.1%.[189] In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 6.03%.[190] In China, the CSI 300 Index lost 3%.[191] In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index sank 4.2%.[192] In Pakistan, the PSX saw the largest ever intra-day plunge in the country's history, losing 2,302 points or 6.0%. The market closed with the KSE 100 index down 3.1%.[193] In India, the BSE SENSEX closed 1,942 points lower at 35,635 while the NSE Nifty 50 was down by 538 points to 10,451.[194] The Washington Post posited that coronavirus-related turmoil could spark a collapse of the corporate debt bubble, sparking and worsening a recession.[195] The Central Bank of Russia announced that it would suspend foreign exchange market purchases in domestic markets for 30 days,[196] while the Central Bank of Brazil auctioned an additional $3.465 billion the foreign exchange market in two separate transactions and the Bank of Mexico increased its foreign exchange auctions program from $20 billion to $30 billion.[197][198] After announcing a $120 billion fiscal stimulus programs on 2 December,[199] Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced additional government spending,[200] while Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani announced additional stimulus as well.[201] As the hashtag #BlackMonday trended on Twitter,[202] news organizations such as the Associated Press,[203] The Economist,[204] and Yahoo Finance UK adopted the term on the day it occurred.[205] While The Guardian initially referred to it as \"Crash Monday\", they also later referred to it as \"The Black Monday of 2020\" to distinguish it from the 1987 crash of the same name.[206] The Associated Press also quoted an analyst of the Australian finance company OFX as saying, \"A blend of shocks have sent the markets into a frenzy on what may only be described as 'Black Monday' ... A combination of a Russia vs. Saudi Arabia oil price war, a crash in equities, and escalations in coronavirus woes have created a killer cocktail to worsen last week\u2019s hangover.\"[207] On the following day of trading, US stocks recouped some of the losses which happened on Monday, rising by more than 4%.[208] This was attributed to a potential fiscal stimulus, such as a potential 0% payroll tax, being proposed by US President Donald Trump.[209] On Wednesday, however, stocks fell once more, and resulted in the DJIA entering a bear market (i.e. 20% drop from the most recent peak) for the first time in 11 years, ending the longest bull market in American stock market history.[210] On 10 March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite, and the S&P 500 all closed 4.9% up,[211] while Asia-Pacific stock markets closed up and European stock markets closed down.[212][213] Oil prices rose by 10%,[214] while yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities rose to 0.70% and 1.16% respectively.[215] The Central Bank of Russia announced a repo auction of \u20bd500 billion (or $7 billion) and increased its foreign exchange swap operation limit to up to $5 billion.[216] while Bank Indonesia conducted open market purchases of government bonds and Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani announced tax-related stimulus.[217] Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced A$2.4 billion in government spending for pandemic countermeasures.[218] On 11 March, Asia-Pacific and European stock markets closed down (with the S&P/ASX 200 on the Australian Securities Exchange falling to more than 20% below its 52-week high),[219][220] while the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 both fell by 5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 6% (with the Dow also falling to more than 20% below its most recent record high set on 19 February).[221][222] Oil prices fell by 4%,[223] while the yield on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities rose to 0.82% and 1.33% respectively.[224] The Índice Bovespa of the Brazil Stock Exchange fell by 8.5% to 27% on the year,[225] while the S&P/TSX Composite Index on the Toronto Stock Exchange also fell to more than 20 percent below its most recent peak on 20 February.[226] The Bank of England announced that it would cut its bank rate by 25 basis points,[227] while Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced £30 billion in government spending with £12 billion specifically directed at pandemic countermeasures.[228] The Federal Reserve announced that it would increase the top level of its overnight repurchase operations to $175 billion.[229] The Bank of Japan announced that it was increasing its annual target of purchases of exchange-traded funds above the current ¥6 trillion (or $57 billion).[230] Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani announced tax relief for the Indonesian manufacturing sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.[231] Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a \u20ac25 billion (or $28 billion) fiscal stimulus.[232] On 11 March, US president Donald Trump gave a public address. In the speech, the president announced a temporary 30-day travel ban on all European goods and passengers from Europe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump's initial statements were later corrected: the ban affected people who were not US citizens and who in the past two weeks had visited the 26-member Schengen Area, but did not include trade goods and cargo and excluded the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. These countries were added to the ban 3 days later. Trump did not consult with the European Union before imposing the travel ban.[233] Carmen Reinicke of Business Insider wrote that Trump's address to the nation \"failed to calm investors' concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak\".[234] According to Ben Levisohn, writer for Barron's, \"Dow futures were up around 300 points before the president\u2019s address began. And then the president started talking\u2014and futures started falling.\"[235] Black Thursday[34][35] was a global stock market crash on 12 March 2020, as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash. US stock markets suffered from the greatest single-day percentage fall since the 1987 stock market crash. Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in US President Donald Trump after he declared a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area.[236] Additionally, the European Central Bank, under the lead of Christine Lagarde, decided to not cut interest rates despite market expectations,[237] leading to a drop in S&P 500 futures of more than 200 points in less than an hour.[238] Bank Indonesia announced open market purchases of Rp4 trillion (or $276.53 million) in government bonds,[239] while Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo stated that Bank Indonesia's open market purchases of government bonds had climbed to Rp130 trillion on the year and Rp110 trillion since the end of January.[240] Despite declining to cut its deposit rate, the European Central Bank increased its asset purchases by \u20ac120 billion (or $135 billion),[241] while the Federal Reserve announced $1.5 trillion in open market purchases.[242] Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a A$17.6 billion fiscal stimulus package.[243] The Reserve Bank of India announced that it would conduct a six-month $2 billion currency swap for U.S. dollars,[244] while the Reserve Bank of Australia announced A$8.8 billion in repurchases of government bonds.[245] The Central Bank of Brazil auctioned $1.78 billion foreign exchange spots.[246] Asia-Pacific stock markets closed down with the Nikkei 225 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the IDX Composite of the Indonesia Stock Exchange falling more than 20% below their 52-week highs.[247][248][249] European stock markets closed down 11% with the UK FTSE 100, German DAX, French CAC 40, Italian FTSE MIB, Finnish OMX Helsinki 25, Swedish OMX Stockholm 30, OMX Nordic 40, and the Latvian OMX Riga indices all closing more than 20% below their most recent peaks.[list 2] In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down an additional 10%, the NASDAQ Composite closed down 9.4%, and the S&P 500 closed down 9.5%. This caused the NASDAQ and S&P 500 to fall to more than 20% below their all time highs, and so the declines activated a trading curb at the New York Stock Exchange for the second time that week.[254][255] Oil prices dropped by 8%,[256] while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities increased to 0.86% and 1.45% (and their yield curve finished normal).[257] The US's Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered from the greatest single-day percentage fall since the 1987 stock market crash, as did the UK's FTSE 100, which fell 10.87%.[258] The Canadian S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 12%, its largest one-day drop since 1940.[259] The FTSE MIB Italian index closed with a −16.92% loss, the worst in its history.[260] Germany's DAX fell 12.24% and France's CAC 12.28%.[261] In Brazil, the Ibovespa plummeted 14.78%, after trading in the B3 was halted twice within the intraday; it also moved below the 70,000 mark before closing above it.[262][263] The NIFTY 50 on the National Stock Exchange of India fell 7.89% to more than 20% below its most recent peak, while the BSE SENSEX on the Bombay Stock Exchange fell 2,919 (or 8.18%) to 32,778.[264] The benchmark stock market index on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange fell by 9.3%.[265] The MERVAL on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange fell 9.5% to 19.5% on the week.[266] 12 March was the second time, following 9 March drop, that the 7%-drop circuit breaker was triggered since being implemented in 2013.[236] In Colombia, the peso set an all-time low against the U.S. dollar, when it traded above 4000 pesos for the first time on record.[267][268] The Mexican peso also set an all-time record low against the U.S. dollar, trading at 22.99 pesos.[269] Soon after trading began, a Level-1 trading curb was triggered on major US stock markets due to increased selling, leading to a 15-minute halt on trading.[234] Level-1 circuit breaker is triggered with a fall of 7% on the S&P 500. The trading halt occurred after the markets reached a drop of 7.2 percent within 15 minutes.
