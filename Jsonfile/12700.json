{"Content: ":"Air charter is the business of renting an entire aircraft (i.e., chartering) as opposed to individual aircraft seats (i.e., purchasing a ticket through a traditional airline). Charter \u2013 also called air taxi or ad hoc \u2013 flights require certification from the associated country's civil aviation authority. The regulations are differentiated from typical commercial/passenger service by offering a non-scheduled service. Analogous regulations generally also apply to air ambulance and cargo operators, which are often also ad hoc for-hire services. In the U.S. these flights are regulated under FAA Part 135.[1] There are some cases where a charter operator can sell scheduled flights, but only in limited quantities.[2] As of 2021, the FAA had made it a priority to crack down on unauthorised charter flights, according to industry experts.[3] There are several business models which offer air charter services from the traditional charter operator to brokers and jet card programs: Charter aircraft categories include: There are an estimated 15,000 business jets available for charter in the world. The US market is the largest, followed by the European market with growing activity in the Middle East, Asia, and Central America.[5] Media related to Charter airlines at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"Air charter - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12700","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_charter"}
