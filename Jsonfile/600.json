{"Content: ":"Anhangueridae is a group of pterosaurs within the suborder Pterodactyloidea.[1] They were among the last pterosaurs to possess teeth. A recent study discussing the group considered the Anhangueridae to be typified by a premaxillary crest and a lateral expansion in the distal rostrum. The same study presented a cladistic analysis, for which an \"agreement subtree\" was calculated. The Anhangueridae was found to be sister taxon to the large crested Tropeognathus.[2] There are competing theories of ornithocheiromorph phylogeny (evolutionary relationships). Below is cladogram following a topology recovered by Brian Andres, using the most recent iteration of his data set (Andres, 2021).[3] Aerodraco sedgwickii Liaoningopterus gui Anhanguera robustus Anhanguera piscator Anhanguera blittersdorffi The cladogram below follows PÃªgas et al. (2019), who recovered Anhangueridae as a much more inclusive group. The analysis found most of the ornithocheirids falling into this family, while Ornithocheirus itself was recovered as a basal member of Ornithocheirae.[4] Hamipterus Iberodactylus Tropeognathus Coloborhynchus Siroccopteryx Uktenadactylus Caulkicephalus Guidraco Ludodactylus Anhanguera Liaoningopterus Cearadactylus Maaradactylus     This pterosaur-related article is a stub.
