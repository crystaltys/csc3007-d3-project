Ramanathan and P. Arunachalam.[2] Vigneswaran's father's work meant that the family moved often. Vigneswaran spent the first nine years of his life in Kurunegala and studied at Christchurch College.[2] The family then moved to Anuradhapura where Vigneswaran attended Holy Family Convent.[2][3] Vigneswaran joined Royal College, Colombo aged 11.[2][4][5] After school Vigneswaran obtained B.A. degree from the University of London and LL.B. degree from the University of Ceylon.[2][3] He then joined Ceylon Law College, qualifying as a proctor and an advocate.[2][3] He was president of the Law Students\u2019 Union at the college in 1962.[2][3] One of Vigneswaran's sons is married to the daughter of government minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara.[6][7] His other son is married to the niece of former MP Keseralal Gunasekera.[2] Vigneswaran is also a follower of the controversial guru Swami Premananda whom he has compared to Jesus and has requested that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi release three jailed followers of Premananda.[8][9] Vigneswaran practised of law for more than fifteen years.[3][10][11] He is a President's Counsel.[12][13] He joined the Judicial Service on 7 May 1979.[5][14] He served as a magistrate and District Judge in Batticaloa, Chavakachcheri and Mallakam.[5][14] He became District Judge for Colombo in January 1987.[5][14] He was appointed to the High Court in 1988, serving in Northern Province, Eastern, North Central, Uva and Western provinces.[5] He was appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1995.[5][10] Vigneswaran was appointed to the Supreme Court in March 2001.[15] He retired in October 2004.[16] In April 2013 it was reported that Vigneswaran had been chosen by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to be its chief ministerial candidate in the upcoming election to Northern Provincial Council (NPC).[17][18] The reports were denied by the TNA.[7] However, in July 2013, after nominations were called for the provincial council election, the TNA announced that Vigneswaran would be its chief ministerial candidate in the Northern Province.[19][20][21] He contested the provincial council election as one of the TNA's candidates in Jaffna District and was elected to the NPC.[22][23] Vigneswaran received his chief ministerial appointment letter from Governor G.
