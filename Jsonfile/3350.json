{"Content: ":"The Napo saki (Pithecia napensis), also known as the Napo monk saki,[1] is a species of saki monkey, a type of New World monkey. Its range includes parts of eastern Ecuador and northern Peru.[2] The name is derived from the Napo River in its locality. This species was originally described by LÃ¶nnberg as the subspecies Pithecia monachus napensis[2][3] and has been treated as a synonym of P. monachus monachus.[4] Hershkovitz retained it under P. monachus in 1987,[5] but it was raised to full species status in 2014.[2]  This New World monkey-related article is a stub.
