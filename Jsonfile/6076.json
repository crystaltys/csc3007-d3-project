{"Content: ":"An expatriate (often shortened to expat) is a person who resides outside their native country.[1] In common usage, the term often refers to educated professionals, skilled workers, or artists taking positions outside their home country, either independently or sent abroad by their employers.[2] However, the term 'expatriate' is also used for retirees and others who have chosen to live outside their native country. Historically, it has also referred to exiles.[3] In contrast to an immigrant, expatriates maintain the cultural ties such as language of their country of origin\u2014thereby not assimilating. Expatriates usually also do not seek to become citizens of their new country. The word expatriate comes from the Latin terms ex (\"out of\") and patria (\"native country, fatherland\"). Dictionary definitions for the current meaning of the word include: These definitions contrast with those of other words with a similar meaning, such as: The varying use of these terms for different groups of foreigners can be seen as implying nuances about wealth, intended length of stay, perceived motives for moving, nationality, and even race. This has caused controversy, with some commentators asserting that the traditional use of the word \"expat\" has had racist connotations.[9][10] An older usage of the word expatriate referred to an exile.[3] Alternatively, when used as a verbal noun, expatriation can mean the act of someone renouncing allegiance to their native country, as in the preamble to the United States Expatriation Act of 1868 which states: 'the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'.[11] Some neologisms have been coined, including: The term \"expatriate\" is sometimes misspelled as \"ex-patriot\", which author Anu Garg has characterised as an example of an eggcorn.[17] In the 19th century, travel became easier by way of steamship or train. People could more readily choose to live for several years in a foreign country, or be sent there by employers. The table below aims to show significant examples of expatriate communities which have developed since that time: During the 1930s, Nazi Germany revoked the citizenship of many opponents, such as Albert Einstein, Oskar Maria Graf, Willy Brandt and Thomas Mann, often expatriating entire families.[19][20] Students who study in another country may or may not be referred to as expatriates.[21][22] In 2002, terrorist attacks against Westerners at times curtailed the party lifestyle of some expatriate communities, especially in the Middle East.[23] The number of expatriates in the world is difficult to determine, since there is no governmental census.[24] Finaccord estimated the number to be 66.2 million in 2017.[25] In 2013, the United Nations estimated that 232 million people, or 3.2% of the world population, lived outside their home country.[citation needed] As of 2019, according to the United Nations, the number of international migrants globally reached an estimated 272 million, or 3.5% of the world population.[26] Some multinational corporations send employees to foreign countries to work in branch offices or subsidiaries. Expatriate employees allow a parent company to more closely control its foreign subsidiaries. They can also improve global coordination.[27] A 2007 study found the key drivers for expatriates to pursue international careers were: breadth of responsibilities, nature of the international environment (risk and challenge), high levels of autonomy of international posts, and cultural differences (rethinking old ways).[28] However, expatriate professionals and independent expatriate hires are often more expensive than local employees. Expatriate salaries are usually augmented with allowances to compensate for a higher cost of living or hardships associated with a foreign posting. Other expenses may need to be paid, such as health care, housing, or fees at an international school. There is also the cost of moving a family and their belongings. Another problem can be government restrictions in the foreign country.[29][30] Spouses may have trouble adjusting due to culture shock, loss of their usual social network, interruptions to their own career, and helping children cope with a new school. These are chief reasons given for foreign assignments ending early.[31] However, a spouse can also act as a source of support for an expatriate professional.[32] Families with children help to bridge the language and culture aspect of the host and home country, while the spouse plays a critical role in balancing the families integration into the culture. Some corporations have begun to include spouses earlier when making decisions about a foreign posting, and offer coaching or adjustment training before a family departs.[33] Research suggests that tailoring pre-departure cross-cultural training and its specific relevance positively influence the fulfilment of expectations in expatriates' adjustment.[34] According to the 2012 Global Relocation Trends Survey Report, 88 per cent of spouses resist a proposed move. The most common reasons for refusing an assignment are family concerns and the spouse's career.[35][36] Expatriate failure is a term which has been coined for an employee returning prematurely to their home country, or resigning. About 7% of expatriates return early, but this figure does not include those who perform poorly while on assignment or resign entirely from a company.[37] When asked the cost of a premature expatriate's return, a survey of 57 multinational companies reported an average cost of about US$225,000.[38] People move abroad for many different reasons.[39] The realisation of what makes people move is the first step in the expatriation process. People could be \u2018pushed\u2019 away as a reaction to specific socio-economic or political conditions in the home country, or \u2018pulled\u2019 towards a destination country because of better work opportunities/conditions. The \u2018pull\u2019 can also include personal preferences, such as climate, a better quality of life, or the fact that family/friends are living there.[40][41] For some people, moving abroad is a conscious, thoroughly planned decision, while for others it could be a \u2018spur of the moment\u2019, spontaneous decision. This decision, of course, is influenced by the individual\u2019s geographic, socioeconomic and political environment; as well as their personal circumstances. The motivation for moving (or staying) abroad also gets adjusted with the different life changes the person experiences \u2013 for example, if they get married, have children, etc. Also, different personalities (or personality types) have diverse reactions to the challenges of adjusting to a host-country culture; and these reactions affect their motivations to continue (or not) living abroad.[42][43][44] In this era of international competition, it is important for companies, as well as for countries, to understand what is that motivates people to move to another country to work. Understanding expatriates\u2019 motivations for international mobility allows organisations to tailor work packages to match expatriates\u2019 expectations in order to attract and/or retain skilled workers from abroad. Trends in recent years among business expatriates have included: The Munich-based research firm InterNations conducts a survey of expat opinions and trends.[59] There has been an increase in scholarly research into the field in recent years. For instance, Emerald Group Publishing in 2013 launched The Journal of Global Mobility: The home of expatriate management research.[60] S.K Canhilal and R.G. Shemueli suggest that successful expatriation is driven by a combination of individual, organizational, and context-related factors.[61] Of these factors, the most significant have been outlined as: cross-cultural competences, spousal support, motivational questions, time of assignment, emotional competences, previous international experience, language fluency, social relational skills, cultural differences, and organizational recruitment and selection process.[62] Expatriate milieus have been the setting of many novels and short stories, often written by authors who spent years living abroad.
