{"Content: ":"Alexandra Yurevna Skochilenko (Russian: Александра Юрьевна Скочиленко), also known as Sasha Skochilenko, (born September 13, 1990 in Leningrad, Soviet Union) is a Russian artist and musician. Sasha is an alumna of the Smolny College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, St. Petersburg State University. She is an author of the \"Book About Depression\" (2014), which helped destigmatize mental health issues in Russia. After taking part in a protest against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Skochilenko was fined 10,000 roubles.[1] On 31 March, Skochilenko was arrested for \"putting fragments of paper in place of price tags, containing information about the use of the Russian armed forces\" in a Perekrestok supermarket.[1] The messages attributed to her included information about Mariupol theatre airstrike on March 16: \"The Russian army bombed an art school in Mariupol where about 400 people were hiding from the shelling.\"[2] Skochilenko was jailed for eight weeks pending trial, accused of being motivated by \"political hatred for Russia\". Under the recently introduced Russian fake news laws she faces a sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment if found guilty.[1] On 30 May, the St. Petersburg District Court extended her pre-trial detention until July in a closed hearing.[3] Human rights groups raised concerns about the conditions of her detention, as she suffers from celiac disease and requires a gluten-free diet, which she was not consistently allowed access to.[4] In a July interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Skochilenko further raised concerns about possible mistreatment, saying that she and the other prisoners in her cell had been forced to completely clean the cell three times a day by hand and the television in the cell was restricted to war films and pro-government news about the invasion.[5] This Russian biographical article is a stub.
