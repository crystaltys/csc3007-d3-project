Yeung of AllMusic said, \"Beerbongs & Bentleys is an apt reflection of his lavish lifestyle and his subsequently begotten hardships, but its attempts at sincerity work only when Post Malone stops trying so hard\".[21] Evan Rytlewski of Pitchfork concluded that Beerbongs & Bentleys \"plays to Post's greatest strength: his melodic instincts. His best hooks are so tuneful and airless they directly target the ear's pleasure centers\", but \"Post Malone's singular, dour mood wears thin and grows stale after too long\".[27] Daniela Campos of Exclaim! wrote that the album represents \"a focus on a rock-star rapper's lifestyle that's being pushed to the forefront for the public eye to decipher\".[23] Jordan M. of Sputnikmusic saying \"This moment of fuzzed-out, fucked-up pop music with questionably scant odes to rap music is not designed for posterity. To his credit, Post gets that, and is content to make overlong albums where every song can be a single. Not every song on Beerbongs & Bentleys can be a single, but there's enough of them hiding in there to make it one of 2018's more rewarding releases\".[29] In the United States, on the day of its release, Beerbongs & Bentleys broke streaming records on Spotify.[43] The album achieved 47.9 million streams in the US and 78,744,000 streams globally on the music service within 24 hours.[44] The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, opening with 461,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, with 153,000 coming from pure sales.
