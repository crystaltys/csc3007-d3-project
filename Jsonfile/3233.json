{"Content: ":"DIY is a United Kingdom-based music publication, in print and online. Its free print edition is released monthly with a physical circulation of 40,000 in UK venues, clubs and shops.[1] DIY was launched in 2002 by then-editor Stephen Ackroyd & Emma Swann as an online-only publication called This Is Fake DIY, named after a song by Scottish indie pop band Bis and staffed largely by a freelance writing team from around the globe. The website features news, reviews and features. In September 2007, DIY was nominated for Best Music Magazine at the annual BT Digital Music Awards, where it was described as \"a great mix of humour and pop culture that has become the envy of the internet.\"[2] In April 2011, DIY started a free monthly music magazine. Cover acts have included Paramore, Mumford and Sons, Biffy Clyro, Jamie xx, Years & Years, Wolf Alice, LCD Soundsystem, Fall Out Boy, and Bastille (full list below). On 11 March 2013, DIY started a weekly magazine in addition to the print title, published via tablet computer and iPhone - this was later pulled in favour of limited edition, one-off titles.[3] Superfood and METZ have both released limited edition 'zines' in collaboration with DIY as part of this. In June 2014, DIY rebranded, dropping the \"This Is Fake\" and launching its new URL - diymag.com. DIY also host live shows across the UK under the name DIY Presents. Every year, they host a run of shows under the Hello moniker, previewing new acts at London's The Old Blue Last. Previous acts to play at DIY's Hello shows include Wolf Alice, Girl Band and Spring King. October 2014 saw DIY team up with PledgeMusic for the first UK-wide DIY Presents tour,[4] culminating in an all-dayer held at London venue The Laundry on 1 November. The tour was opened by local acts, as picked via fan-vote, and headlined by Shy Nature and Flyte. The all-dayer was headlined by JAWS, and featured Menace Beach, Spring King, Hinds and many more.[5] In the autumn of 2015, DIY's new music arm Neu hosted the DIY Presents Neu Tour 2015, which saw VANT, The Big Moon and Inheaven tour the country, culmating in a London date at Camden's Dingwalls. In 2007 DIY started a record label. Its roster included Duels, Heads We Dance, Manda Rin, Model Horror, Love Ends Disaster!, Popular Workshop, The Research, The Victorian English Gentlemens Club, We Are The Physics and You Animals.","Title":"DIY (magazine) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3233","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_(magazine)"}
