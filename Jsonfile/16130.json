{"Content: ":"The Institut français des relations internationales (Ifri; English French Institute of International Relations) is a think tank dedicated to international affairs, based in Paris, France. Ifri was established in 1979 by Thierry de Montbrial, who was inspired by the American model of research institutions. Ifri aims at gathering decision-makers and researchers to develop research and debate on major contemporary international issues. In 2011, for the fourth consecutive year, Ifri was the only French based research institution to be ranked among the top 50 most influential think tanks worldwide outside of the United States, placing 3rd in Western Europe according to \"Global Go-To Think Tanks\", a study undertaken by a team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, and ranking more than 6,480 institutes located in 169 countries. Ifri\u2019s goal is to: Ifri is independent from all administrative and financial regulatory authorities and has no affiliation with any political party. Its political and intellectual independence is paramount and the Institute chose to diversify its public and private sources of funding. Its budget amounts to about 6.5 million Euros, about 70% of which is from private sources.[citation needed] Ifri employs 60 people or so, 30 of them being French, and the balance are foreign researchers from various backgrounds. More than half of them are less than 40 years old. Outside of their research work, every year, Ifri hosts guest speakers from all over the world for them to shed light upon international issues. The Institute organizes about 40 conferences each year in Paris (42 in 2011). Guest speakers from previous years have included between others: Nicolas Sarkozy, Dmitri Medvedev, Hu Jintao, Jalal Talabani, Hamid Karzai, Vladimir Putin, Mikheil Saakashvili, Abdoulaye Wade, Vaclav Klaus, Pervez Musharraf, Abdullah Gül, Boris Tadic, Viktor Yanukovych, Paul Kagamé, Herman Van Rompuy, José Manuel Barroso, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen. In 1973, Minister of Foreign Affairs Michel Jobert under President Georges Pompidou put Thierry de Montbrial in charge of establishing the Centre d\u2019Analyse et de Prévision at the Ministry in order to analyze the international relations system. This encouraged him to imagine an independent research center dedicated to this subject. In 1979, he founded Ifri with the support of Prime Minister Raymond Barre and Minister of Foreign Affairs Louis de Guiringaud and his successor Jean François-Poncet. Marc Gilbert (in French), ex producer of Italiques (talk show) at the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française became the general secretary. Ifri was established upon an already existing institution, the Centre d\u2019Etudes de Politique Etrangère founded in 1935 by French universities and by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Today, the Institute has about 80 partner companies and almost 400 members, who are either private individuals or state and NGO institutions. Dominique Moïsi is a special advisor. Ifri works in partnership with its counterparts on a regular basis ; the RAND Corporation, the Brookings Institution, the Council On Foreign Relations and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace, the Japan Institute for International Affairs (JIIA), the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), the French-Korean Foundation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für auswärtige Politik, and others. Ifri is also based in Brussels since March 2005 with its new office: Ifri Bruxelles organizes about 30 events each year. The policy oriented research advocated by Ifri aims at highlighting the important international events. It is mainly addressed to political and economical decision-makers, academic institutions, opinion leaders as well as representative of civil societies. To carry out this ambition, its work is divided into research centers which are organized by Each center publishes its own collection online, available on the Ifri website. Ramsès, an annual collective work and the quarterly magazine Politique Etrangère are the two main editorial activities of Ifri. Since 1981, the annual report Ramsès is dedicated to the main global trends, and its circulation runs about 10,000 copies. Politique Etrangère, which was created in 1936, is the first French magazine on the subject. This quarterly magazine offers a cross-divisional vision of the current international affairs. A special issue was published in 2006 to celebrate the magazine\u2019s 70th anniversary.
