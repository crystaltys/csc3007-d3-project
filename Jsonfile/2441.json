{"Content: ":"Saint Grimbald (or Grimwald) (c. 820s \u2013 8 July 901) was a 9th-century Benedictine monk at the Abbey of Saint Bertin near Saint-Omer, France.[1] Although of dubious historical accuracy, the life of Grimbald was recorded in several volumes, of which the main source is referred to as the Vita Prima of St. Grimbaldi.[2] According to the Vita Prima, King Alfred met Grimbald before his reign, and after his coronation invited Grimbald to England around 892.[2] Invited for his linguistic and compositional ability, Grimbald was one of several scholars who had been invited to the English court by Alfred to assist him in his literary pursuits,[2] and was among the most prominent.[3] In fact, in the Introduction of his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, Alfred mentions the help he received from Grimbald in composing Latin.[4] Although it is said that during Grimbald's life he refused King Alfred's offer of appointment to the see of Canterbury,[2] after Alfred's death he accepted appointment as abbot to a yet unbuilt monastery, New Minster, in Winchester by King Edward.[1] Grimwald died at New Minster on 8 July 901.[2] He was venerated as a saint and confessor, and some altars were dedicated to him. He also figures in a number of legendary tales of Oxford.[4] The Grimbald Gospels in the British Library are named after him.[5]  This biographical article about a French religious figure is a stub.
