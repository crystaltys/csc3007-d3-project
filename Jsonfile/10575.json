{"Content: ":"The government of Russia has initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country with preventive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 in the country, which involved imposing quarantines, carrying raids on potential virus carriers, and using facial recognition to impose quarantine measures.[1] Measures to prevent a crisis in Russia include banning the export of medical masks, random checks on the Moscow Metro, and cancellation of large-scale events by schools. The Russian government has also taken measures to prevent foreign citizens from heavily affected countries from visiting Russia.[citation needed] Local governments have also responded to the pandemic by imposing their own preventive measures in their communities. ==Background==1111 On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.[2][3] Compared to SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19[4][5] has been much lower, but the incubation period and transmission have been significantly greater, resulting in a significant total death toll.[4][6] On 31 January, first two cases in the country were confirmed, one in Tyumen, Tyumen Oblast, and another one in Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai. Both were Chinese nationals.[7] There were no other confirmed cases until 2 March when the first case in Moscow was confirmed.[8][9] On 19 March, the first death of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 was reported in Moscow.[10][11] The victim was identified in the media as Valentina Zubareva, professor at the Gubkin University, she had contracted the disease in Russia.[12] The first two confirmed deaths were recorded on 25 March in Moscow.[13] The Russian consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor advised tourists to refrain from visiting Wuhan and stay away from Chinese zoos and markets selling animals and seafood. The agency also said that development of a vaccine against the virus was underway, relying on the WHO's recommendations.[15][16] A total of 144 Russians were evacuated from Wuhan, the initial centre of the outbreak, and were quarantined in Tyumen Oblast for two weeks from 5 February.[17] On 24 March, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin told President Putin at a meeting that \"a serious situation is unfolding\" and that the relatively low number of confirmed cases could be due to a low level of testing, saying that \"there are far more people who are infected\" and that the number of people in Moscow suspected of having the coronavirus was about 500.[18][19][20] A number of venues and parks in Russia including Crocus Expo, Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy and Patriot Park in Moscow and Lenexpo in Saint Petersburg were turned into temporary hospitals.[21][22][23] On 24 January, the first testing systems were developed and deployed to laboratories around the country.[24] As of 23 March, Russia had 4 testing systems and had carried out over 165 thousand tests for the virus[25][26] which is among the highest testing numbers in the world.[27] Two private lab companies started testing on 26 March. According to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, as of 25 March 141 state laboratories were conducting tests in 79 federal subjects.[28] There are plans to increase the number of reference centres across the country to 15.[25][29][30] On 27 March, the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) registered two more test systems.[31] In Moscow on 21 March the average of those tested was low at 35 years and starting to rise to 37\u201339 years.[32] On 9 April, Russia passed the 1 million test mark and in addition to the laboratories of Rospotrebnadzor 200 state medical laboratories and 22 private laboratories are carrying out testing. There is a drive to further expand testing with any laboratory being able to carry out tests by submitting a notification to the central website.[33] On 27 April, Russia passed the 3 million test mark.[34] On 28 April Anna Popova head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) in a presidential update stated that there were now 506 laboratories testing and that 45% of those tested have no symptoms with the number having pneumonia reducing from 25% to 20% and only 5% of patients with a severe form. 40% of infections were from family members. The speed of people reporting illness has improved from 6 days to the day people find symptoms. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors and 20% have immunity.[35] Russia continued to have the 2nd highest rate of testing in the world with 4.1m tests at 3 May,[36] 5.2m tests at 9 May,[37] 6.1m tests at 14 May,[38] 7.1m tests on 18 May,[39] 9m tests on 26 May and 10m tests on 29 May.[40] Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization's representative in Russia, stated that Russia, in accordance with WHO recommendations, \"started testing literally at the end of January.\"[41] Coronavirus testing in Russia was provided by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Novosibirsk and had to be verified there.[42][43] There was concern that the tests may have insufficient sensitivity,[42][43] despite the fact that the tests were verified in China since early February, showed the degree of sensitivity similar to or higher than other tests and the lab has been approved by the World Health Organization.[42] Since 23 March, European Russia doesn't send their batches to Novosibirsk for verification, verifying them instead in a Moscow reference centre.[30] In a study announced on 14 May, 5.6% of symptomless patients in St. Petersburg had detectable levels of antibodies to coronavirus. The study covered 1,276 coronavirus-positive volunteers aged from 11 to 93 with no COVID-19 symptoms. The study was carried out by Virology Center of St. Petersburg's Hospital No 40 who have carried out 22,000 coronavirus tests since the study started on 1 April. Antibody testing was carried out on the basis of enzyme-linked immunoassay. The announcement stated \"The idea is that many hope that after having mild forms of the disease they could be spared from it. Practice however shows that it is not so. So, people should not relax. The immunity stratum is not that thick,\"[44] On 23 January, the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk, near the Chinese border, limited access to the country. Cultural exchange and official visits to China were cancelled. The Governors of the Amur Oblast Vasily Orlov, and of the Penza Oblast Ivan Belozertsev, called on residents to abandon trips to China altogether.

Previously, only a commission led by the Minister of Emergency Situations could do that.[74] On 1 April, Prime Minister Mishustin and the Minister of Communications Maxut Shadayev announced creating a system of tracking quarantine violation based on data of mobile network operators. Violators will receive a text message, and if they breach it systematically, the information will be sent to the police.[75] On 2 April, President Putin extended the non-working period to 30 April.[76] On 28 March, Chechen authorities urged the population of the republic to stay at their places of permanent residence, and banned entry to Grozny for anyone except emergency services, food supplies, government officials, police, and journalists.[77] On the next day, Chechnya closed its borders, with a full lockdown coming into effect on 30 March.[78] On 29 March, Moscow issued a stay-at-home order for all residents starting on 30 March.
