As a wahid hadith, this report is not viewed as reliable by experts, writes Majlesi, especially because it contradicts the Twelver belief that the earth cannot be void of Imam at any time, as the hujjat Allah (lit.\u2009'proof of God'). Majlesi instead suggests that death is meant figuratively in this hadith, referring to the forgotten memory of al-Qa'im after his long occultation.[23] One of the titles of the Ismaili Imam is qa'im, conveying that it is the Imam who ushers in the resurrection (qiyama).[24] According to Nasir Khusraw, a senior dignitary of the Fatimid Ismaili Imams, the line of Imams from among Ali\u2019s descendants though Husayn will eventually culminate in the arrival of the Lord of the Resurrection (Qa'im al-Qiyama). This individual is believed to be the perfect being and the purpose of creation, and through him the world will come out of darkness and ignorance and \"into the light of her Lord\" (Quran 39:69). His era, unlike that of the enunciators of divine revelation (natiqs) who came before him, is not one where God prescribes the people to work, rather, his is an era of reward for those \"who laboured in fulfilment of (the prophets') command and with knowledge.\" Preceding the Lord of the Resurrection is his proof (hujjat). The Quranic verse stating that \"the night of power (laylat al-qadr) is better than a thousand months\" (Quran 97:3) is said to refer to him, whose knowledge is superior to that of a thousand Imams, though their rank, collectively, is one. Nasir Khusraw also recognizes the successors of the Lord of the Resurrection to be his deputies (khulafa').[25]","Title":"Qa'im Al Muhammad - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12073","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Q%C4%81%CA%BEim_%C4%80l_Mu%E1%B8%A5ammad"}
