{"Content: ":"The Hessenpark is an open-air museum in Neu-Anspach (near Wehrheim-Obernhain), Hesse, Germany. It was founded in 1974 by the Hesse State Government headed by Albert Osswald (SPD). The museum showcases half-timbered buildings from the land of Hesse. As of 2006, there were almost 100 houses on display. The Hessenpark is a popular family destination. One of the major goals of Hessenpark museum is to preserve and display traditional buildings from various regions around the state of Hesse. Exhibits are grouped into \"Baugruppen\" (building ensembles) that represent the way these buildings may have been found in their original locations, such as villages, farmsteads or workshops, often including historical furniture, tools and machinery. Due to cultural heritage management laws in Germany, traditional buildings can only be moved or demolished under exceptional circumstances. Hessenpark represents one of the ways in which such a building may avoid demolition. In this case, the building is carefully deconstructed, moved to the museum grounds and re-erected. [1] In this manner, the museum is able to provide its visitors with new exhibits on a regular basis. Other goals of Hessenpark include Besides the educational aspects, Hessenpark is frequently used for events such as weddings. It also offers an annual christmas market.
