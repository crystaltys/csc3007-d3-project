They are called \"lefteye flounders\" because most species lie on the sea bottom on their right sides, with both eyes on their left sides.[1] The family is also distinguished by the presence of spines on the snout and near the eyes.[2] Lefteye flounders vary considerably in size between the more than 160 species, ranging from 4.5 cm (1.8 in) to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length.[2] Scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) larva Wide-eyed flounder, Bothus podas Laeops macrophthalmus Monolene atrimana Deepwater flounder, Monolene sessilicauda Sash flounder, Trichopsetta ventralis","Title":"Bothidae - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11545","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothidae"}
