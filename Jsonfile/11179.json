{"Content: ":"V451 was a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by the University of Queensland and the Australian pharmaceutical company CSL Limited. The vaccine candidate used the University of Queensland's molecular clamp technology[1] and the MF59 adjuvant.[2] V451 is a protein subunit vaccine. As part of the vaccine's design, researchers added \"a fragment of one protein found on the HIV virus\"[3] as a \"ground-breaking molecular clamp technology\".[4] The development of the vaccine was cancelled on 11 December 2020 during its Phase I trial, after a number of trial participants were found to give false positive test results for HIV antibodies when they did not in fact have HIV.[5][6] This was due to the HIV virus fragment used as a molecular clamp leading to \"a partial antibody response\" to HIV. This is an undesirable outcome as it will interfere with future HIV screening tests for affected participants.[7] Nine days prior to the termination, on 2 December, the first emergency use authorisation had been granted to a COVID-19 vaccine; the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom.[8] Following the termination of V451, vaccine production capacity by CSL Limited was diverted to the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.[9]","Title":"V451 vaccine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11179","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V451_vaccine"}
