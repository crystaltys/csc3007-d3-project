{"Content: ":"The Grammy Award for Album of the Year is presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales, chart position, or critical reception.\"[1] Album of the Year is the most prestigious award category at the Grammys, and it is one of the general field awards alongside Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year, presented annually since the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959. Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon and Taylor Swift are the biggest winners of the award, with each of them having won it three times. Over the years, the rules on who was presented with an award have changed: The category expanded to include eight nominees in 2019,[2] and to ten in 2021.[3] Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, featured artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer with significant contributions to that album. The similarly titled Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. [4] Tom Coyne (as mastering engineer); Serban Ghenea and John Hanes (as engineers/mixers) are the biggest winners in this category with four wins. They are followed by Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon, Taylor Swift, and Stevie Wonder (as performers); David Foster, Daniel Lanois, Phil Ramone, and Ryan Tedder (as record producers); Tom Elmhirst and Mike Piersante (as engineers/mixers); and Bob Ludwig (as mastering engineer) with three victories each. Coyne, Ghenea, Hanes, and Ludwig are the only people to win the award in three consecutive years. Paul McCartney leads all performers with nine nominations: five as a member of The Beatles, three for solo albums, and one as a member of Wings. Sinatra leads solo performers with eight nominations, seven for solo albums and one for a duet album. Barbra Streisand has the most nominations amongst female artists with six. McCartney and Simon are the only artists with nominations in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. The first woman to win the award was Judy Garland in 1962, for Judy at Carnegie Hall. Taylor Swift was the first solo female artist to win the award twice and thrice. Swift and Adele are the only women to win the award more than once for their own albums, winning for Fearless, 1989, and Folklore; and 21 and 25, respectively (Swift was also nominated for Red and Evermore).

A list of the top twenty records is given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then select the top five records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot.[8] The rest of the members then vote a winner from the five nominees.[9] In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated albums will be increased to eight.[10] ^[I] Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.","Title":"Grammy Award for Album of the Year - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2817","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year"}
