{"Content: ":"The American Economic Review is a monthly peer-reviewed academic journal published by the American Economic Association. First published in 1911, it is considered one of the most prestigious and highly distinguished journals in the field of economics.[1][2] The current editor-in-chief is Esther Duflo (MIT). The journal is based in Pittsburgh.[3] In 2004, the American Economic Review began requiring \"data and code sufficient to permit replication\" of a paper's results, which is then posted on the journal's website. Exceptions are made for proprietary data.[4] Until 2017, the May issue of the American Economic Review, titled the Papers and Proceedings issue, featured the papers presented at the American Economic Association's annual meeting that January. After being selected for presentation, the papers in the Papers and Proceedings issue did not undergo a formal process of peer review.[5][6][7][8] Starting in 2018, papers presented at the annual meetings have been published in a separate journal, AEA Papers and Proceedings, which is released annually in May.[9] The American Economic Association was founded in 1885. From 1856 until 1907 the Association published the Publications of the American Economic Association. The first volume was published 1886 (March) - 1887 (January), in 6 issues. The 2nd volume in 1887-1888 and so on until 1896 (vol. 11). In that same year an issue with 'General Contents and Index of Volumes I to XI appeared. Most of the volumes contained only one text, like for instance volume 4, issue 2 (April 1889) that contained an article by Sidney Webb, entitled Socialism in England. In December 1897 a new series started, with only two issues. In 1900 the third series started, until 1908, with four issues yearly.[10] The next three years the Association published what was called The Economic Bulletin. It also appeared in four issues yearly. Every issue of this Bulletin contained a section \"Personal and Miscellaneous Notes\" and a number of book reviews.[11] During the years 1908 to 1910 appeared the American Economic Association Quarterly. The header said \"Formerly published under the titel of Publications of the American Economic Association and the numbering continued as third series, volumes 9 to 11.[12] In March 1911 the first issue of The American Economic Review saw the light. In 2011 a \"Top 20 Committee,\" consisting of Kenneth Arrow, Douglas Bernheim, Martin Feldstein, Daniel McFadden, James M. Poterba, and Robert Solow, selected the following twenty articles to be the most important ones to appear in the journal:[13] Thirteen of those authors have received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The journal can be accessed online via JSTOR. In both 2006 and 2007, it was the most widely viewed journal of all the 775 journals in JSTOR.[14] Other notable papers from the journal include: In 2016, an anonymous group of economists collaboratively wrote a note alleging academic misconduct by the authors and editor of a paper published in the American Economic Review.[15][16] The note was published under the name Nicolas Bearbaki in homage to Nicolas Bourbaki.[17]","Title":"American Economic Review - Wikipedia","KeyID":"4571","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Economic_Review"}
