{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Togo is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Togo in March 2020.[2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] In September 2021, Togo is extending the state of health emergency until September 2022 following the upsurge in new cases of coronavirus in recent weeks. Access to administrative buildings is now subject to presentation of a COVID-19 vaccine pass.  After an extraordinary council of ministers on 16 March, the government announced they would establish an XOF 2 billion fund to fight the pandemic. They also established the following measures: suspending flights from Spain, Italy, France, and Germany; canceling all international events for three weeks; requiring people who were recently in a high-risk country to self-isolate; closing their borders; and prohibiting events with more than 100 people effective 19 March.[46] In accordance with the ban on large gatherings, on 18 March, the Togolese Football Federation suspended competitions. Other events were canceled too, including the FILBLEU literature festival.[47] Togo provided digital stimulus payments to almost a million residents.[48] Media related to COVID-19 pandemic in Togo at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Togo - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10326","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Togo"}
