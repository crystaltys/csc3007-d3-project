Drilling for a new park attracts rare sharks which slowly devour the tourists. In the middle of the movie, the character \"Nookie\" is invited over to a yacht party which turns deadly as the sharks attack the vessel. They are rescued and they move on to save the main character's dad who had jumped in the water to save a stranded girl. At the end a reporter says that the attacks are over. However, a shark jumps out of the water and the screen cuts to black. The torment is far from over.[1][2]","Title":"Jersey Shore Shark Attack - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18699","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore_Shark_Attack"}
