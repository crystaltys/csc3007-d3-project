{"Content: ":"The Russian 2022 Laws Establishing War Censorship and Prohibiting Anti-War Statements and Calls for Sanctions is a group of federal laws, promulgated by Russian authorities during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These laws prohibit a dissemination of \"unreliable information\" about Russian Armed Forces, other Russian state bodies and its operations, establishing criminal punishment for such dissemination (Law No.32-FZ, Law No.63-FZ), and prohibit a \"discrediting\" of Russian Armed Forces, other Russian state bodies and a calls for sanctions against Russia, establishing administrative (Law No.31-FZ, Law No.62-FZ) and criminal (Law No.32-FZ, Law No.63-FZ) punishment for such actions.[1][2] These laws are further extension of Russian fake news laws. The adoption of these laws caused the mass exodus of foreign media from Russia and termination of the activity of independent Russian media. The Federal Law of 4 March 2022 No.31-FZ (adopted by State Duma on 4 March 2022, approved by Federation Council on 4 March 2022, signed by President of Russia on 4 March 2022) supplemented the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with articles 20.3.3 and 20.3.4.[3] The article 20.3.3 provides huge administrative fines for natural persons and juridical persons for a \"discrediting\" of Russian Armed Forces and its operations, including the calls for prevention of the use of Russian Armed Forces for the interests of the Russian Federation. The article 20.3.4 provides huge administrative fines for natural persons and juridical persons for a calls to impose sanctions against Russia, Russian citizens or Russian legal entities.[citation needed] The Federal Law of 4 March 2022 No.32-FZ (adopted by State Duma on 4 March 2022, approved by Federation Council on 4 March 2022, signed by President of Russia on 4 March 2022) supplemented the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation with articles 207.3, 280.3 and 284.2.[4] The article 207.3 provides imprisonment for up to 15 years for a dissemination of unreliable information about Russian Armed Forces and its operations.[5][6] The article 280.3 provides imprisonment for up to 5 years for a \"discrediting\" of Russian Armed Forces and its operations, including the calls for prevention of the use of Russian Armed Forces for the interests of the Russian Federation. The article 284.2 provides imprisonment for up to 3 years for a calls to impose sanctions against Russia, Russian citizens or Russian legal entities. The laws No.31-FZ and No.32-FZ use so-called Dadin scheme: a first call against the use of Russian Armed Forces or the call for sanctions on Russia is punishable under the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses, a second one is punishable under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. A dissemination of unreliable information about Russian Armed Forces and its operations is punishable under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation only.[7] According to the reigning approach in Russian law-enforcement practice, a violations, committed through Internet publications, are considered continuing violations that allows authorities to persecute people for text published before aforementioned laws entered into force; statute of limitations will start to run after a removing a text.[8] The Federal Laws of 25 March 2022 No.62-FZ and No.63-FZ (adopted by State Duma on 22 March 2022, approved by Federation Council on 23 March 2022, signed by President of Russia on 25 March 2022) amended the article 20.3.3 of the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses (Law No.62-FZ)[9] and the article 207.3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Law No.63-FZ).[10] These amendments made punishable \"discrediting\" of exercise of the powers, carrying out by not only Russian Armed Forces but any Russian state body (including National Guard, Federal Security Service, Ministry of Emergency Situations, General Prosecutor's Office, Investigative Committee, Ministry of Foreign Affairs) outside Russian territory.[11][12] Many Russian media outlets were forced to stop covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine because of this bill, including Colta.ru, \"Snob\" online magazine, Znak.com, \"The Bell\" online magazine, and Novaya Gazeta.[13][14][15] Dozhd said it was temporarily suspending operations due to the enactment of the aforementioned law.[16] Radio Liberty announced that it would stop working in Russia due to the new law on fakes, but would continue to cover events in Ukraine while abroad.[17] Also on the territory of the Russian Federation, Bloomberg News, CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, BBC News, RTVE, EFE, RAI, TG5, ANSA stopped working.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] According to Agentstvo, over 150 journalists left Russia by 7 March since Putin signed the bill into law.[27] On 7 April 2022, to avoid prosecutions under the law, journalists from Novaya Gazeta announced the launch of Novaya Gazeta Europe, with its editor-in-chief, Kirill Martynov, stating that Novaya Gazeta Europe would be independent from Novaya Gazeta \"both legally and in practice\", with its newsroom consisting of staffers who have left Russia.[28] As recently as 30 April 2022 Animators against war broadcast on YouTube episode number six of their campaign against the invasion although it attempts to fly under the radar. With only a Ukrainian flag and the face of Putin represented pictorially in a two-minute short feature, the impact of these censorship laws is evident.[29][30] Oleg Kuvaev, the originator of Masyanya, a cartoon character and series, turned his acid pen against the Putinian invasion of Ukraine as early as 22 March 2022 with the broadcast of episode #160. In the episode, the characters compare Putin with Adolf Hitler. At the end of the episode, Masyanya delivers to Putin a Katana with him so he can do the only honourable thing left and commit seppuku. Roskomnadzor is aware of the problem, as indeed are TASS and Ria Novosti,[31] but Kuvaev now lives in Israel and might have cancelled his Russian citizenship. A DDoS attack was launched against Kuvaev-controlled assets two days after the regulator made its threat about the episode because it \"discredits the Russian Federation's armed forces\" and \"contains false information of social importance about the ongoing military operation to defend the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\", but it is not immediately apparent how the Putinian regime will deal with this conundrum as the series is monetized as well on YouTube. Criminal punishment of people who \"deliberately distribute false news\" is foreseen, but the limits to jurisdiction still apply. It is not documented when the Prosecutor-General of Russia will commence extradition proceedings,[31] and maybe the Israeli government need to watch out for Sergei Fedotov and Ruslan Boshirov. On 12 May 2022 episode #161 of Masyanya was broadcast and was all about how to explain to children the fact that what they saw with their own eyes was not to be spoken aloud for fear of drawing the Russian authorities anger and lust for administrative violence on the family.[29] In episode #162 which reached YouTube viewers on 11 July 2022, Russia is attacked by China and bombs fall on (at least) Novgorod, Moscow and Tver. The Chinese president wants to denazify Russia and recuperate Chinese lands. The Chinese president observes that Russian is not a real language, in fact it is a derivative from the Ukrainian language. The animation sometimes superimposes cartoon characters on a background of photographs of real life monuments and buildings, such as for example the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in Mariupol. The animation concludes with a parenthetical observation that \"this war\" is the shame of Russia and that Russia will as a result suffer damnation for centuries.[29] On 16 March 2022, Russian socialite and food blogger Veronika Belotserkovskaya became the first individual charged under the \"fakes law\".[32] On 22 March 2022, Russian television journalist Alexander Nevzorov was charged under the law after he published information that Russian forces shelled a maternity hospital in Mariupol.[33] Nevzorov said that Vladimir Putin's \"regime is not going to spare anyone, and that any attempts to comprehend the criminal war [in Ukraine] will end in prison.\"[34] On 25 March 2022, Russian journalist Izabella Yevloyeva was charged under the \"fakes law\" after sharing a post on social media that described the \"Z\" symbol as being \"synonymous with aggression, death, pain and shameless manipulation\".[33] On 13 April 2022, Russian journalist Mikhail Afanasyev, editor-in-chief of the online magazine Novy Fokus, was detained by police over its reporting on the war in Ukraine. He faces up to 10 years in prison.[35] Afanasyev was twice awarded with the Andrei Sakharov Prize \"For Journalism as a Deed.\"[36] According to OVD-Info, over 400 people were detained or fined by April under the laws prohibiting \"fake\" information about the military.[37] On 22 April 2022, Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza was charged by a Russian court for spreading of \u201cfalse\u201d information about the Russian military.[38] The reason for the criminal case against Kara-Murza was his March 15 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives, in which he denounced the war in Ukraine.[39] Russian journalist Ilya Krasilshchik [ru], the former publisher of Meduza news website, was charged by a Russian court for spreading \"fake news\" about the massacre in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.[39] On 18 May 2022, an administrative offense case of discrediting Russian Armed Forces was filed against Soviet and Russian Rock musician Yuri Shevchuk, the leader of the rock band DDT, after he said at a concert in Ufa: \"The motherland, my friends, is not the president\u2019s ass that has to be slobbered and kissed all the time. The motherland is an impoverished old woman at the train station selling potatoes.\"[40][41] The case was opened by Police Division №7 of Ufa and was sent to the court of Sovietsky district of Ufa but subsequently had been referred to the court of Dzerzhinsky district of Saint Petersburg.[42] Subsequently, the court returned the case to the Police Division №7 of Ufa due to the lack of description of committed violation in the text of the police protocol.[43] On 15 July 2022, the case came before the court of Dzerzhinsky district of Saint Petersburg again.[44] On 18 July 2022, the court of Dzerzhinsky district of Saint Petersburg again returned the case due to the lack of signature of Yuri Shevchuk and of information that he was apprised of his rights in the text of the police protocol.[45] More than 2,000 people were detained or fined by May 2022 under the laws prohibiting \"fake\" information about the military.[46] The first person convicted under the article 207.3 the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation is Pyotr Mylnikov, resident of Olovyannaya, Zabaykalsky Krai, who published in the chat in Viber the documents about mobile crematoriums owned by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. On 30 May 2022, Olovyanninsky District court found him guilty of dissemination of unreliable information about Russian Armed Forces and its operations and sentenced him to a fine of 1,000,000 rubles.[47] The first person imprisoned under article 207.3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation is Alexei Gorinov, a deputy at Moscow\u2019s Krasnoselsky district council and 60 years old engineer, lawyer and human rights defender. In the view of the prosecution party, his fault was to speech at council meeting on 15 March 2022: \"How can we talk about a children's drawing competition, when children are dying every day?! About 100 children have been killed in Ukraine, and children are becoming orphans. I believe that all efforts of civil society should be aimed at stopping war and withdraw troops from Ukraine.\".[48] On 27 April 2022, Gorinov was detained and taken into custody in Matrosskaya Tishina.[48] During the case hearing, Gorinov maintained his innocence, pointing to his rights to free expression under the Russian constitution, and said from the prisoner's box: \"I thought that Russia exhausted its limit on wars back in the 20th century. However, our present is Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel. Do these names mean something to you? You, my accusers \u2013 take an interest and do not say later that you did not know anything.\". Forensic expert of the Ministry of Justice stated that only the sentence about killed children contained in Gorinov's speech at counsil meeting is a statement of fact, the rest of the speech is a personal opinion.[48] Despite this conclusion, Gorinov was convicted on 8 July 2022 to a seven-year term. Judge Olesya Mendeleyeva ruled that his motivation was \"based on political hatred\" and that he had misled Russians, prompting them to \"feel anxiety and fear\" about the invasion, while a sympathizer said this was \"historic hell\".[49] Meanwhile, at least 50 other Russians including Alexandra Skochilenko await similar trials.[50][49] The Putin administration was quick to pervert the law which it had passed scant months before. Instead of the legally-mandated \"police action\" or lexically-approved \"special military operation\", political scientists favoured by the Kremlin like Sergey Karaganov use the word \"war\" openly, as in this April 2022 interview: \"The stakes of the Russian elite are very high \u2013 for them it is an existential war.\"[51] On 14 March 2022, Amnesty International published a statement criticizing Russian laws promulgated on 4 March 2022. Amnesty International strongly condemns the escalating attack against civil society organizations and independent media unleashed by the Russian authorities since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and urges the Russian authorities to abide by their international human rights obligations and Russia's own Constitution to respect, protect and fulfill the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, including by allowing peaceful anti-war protests to go ahead unhindered; releasing all peaceful protesters and dropping the charges against them; lifting all restrictions on independent media and overturning or amending all laws that overly and arbitrarily restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. The organization is calling on the international community to stand in solidarity with and provide support to Russian civil society activists, human rights defenders and journalists who are at increased risk for expressing their opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[52] Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said that \"These new laws are part of Russia\u2019s ruthless effort to suppress all dissent and make sure the [Russian] population does not have access to any information that contradicts the Kremlin\u2019s narrative about the invasion of Ukraine.\"[53]","Title":"Russian 2022 war censorship laws - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16030","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_2022_war_censorship_laws"}
