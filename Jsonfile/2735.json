{"Content: ":"Yakima County is a county in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 256,728.[1] The county seat and largest city is Yakima.[2] The county was formed out of Ferguson County in January 1865 and is named for the Yakama tribe of Native Americans. Yakima County comprises the Yakima, WA Metropolitan Statistical Area and is Washington state's largest majority-Hispanic county as of 2020.[3] The area that now comprises Yakima County was part of the Oregon Country at the start of the nineteenth century, inhabited both by fur prospectors from Canada, and Americans seeking land for agricultural and mineral-extraction opportunities. Unable to resolve which country should control this vast area, the Treaty of 1818 provided for joint control. By 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon had been established, although at first there were questions as to its authority and extent. During its existence, that provisional government formed the area north of the Columbia River first into the Washington Territory, and then (December 19, 1845) into two vast counties: Clark and Lewis. The Washington Territory was formed as a separate governing entity in 1853. In 1854, that legislature carved several counties out of the two original large counties, including Skamania County. Later in 1854 the new Skamania County was reduced in size by carving out Walla Walla County. This arrangement lasted until January 23, 1863, when Ferguson County was carved out of Walla Walla County.[4] However, the Ferguson County government and boundary was dissolved on January 18, 1865, and its area was assigned to Yakima County three days later. Since its creation, the Yakima County boundary has been altered two times. In 1883 a portion of its area was carved off in the creation of Kittitas County, and in 1905 a further reduction added to the creation of Benton County. The Yakama Indian Reservation was created in 1855. However, several tribes felt the agreement creating this reserved area had been completed without sufficient native input, and skirmishes and local war (the Yakima War, which lasted until 1858) meant that the reservation was not fully operational for two decades. The Reservation is the 15th largest reservation in America, covering 1,573 mi2 (4,074 km2),[5] and comprising 36% of the county's total area. Its population was 31,799 in 2000, and its largest city is Toppenish. According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 4,311 square miles (11,170 km2), of which 4,295 square miles (11,120 km2) is land and 16 square miles (41 km2) (0.4%) is water.[6] Yakima County is the second-largest county in Washington by land area and third-largest by total area. Yakima County is reputed to be one of the most difficult places on earth to predict weather, because of its surrounding mountains. The county's area is larger than the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.[7] The highest point in the county is Mount Adams, which is the second tallest peak in Washington and the third tallest in the Cascade Range.

It is Washington's third largest officially designated American Viticultural Area (AVA), and is responsible for more than 40% of the state's wine production. Located within the larger Columbia Valley AVA, the Yakima Valley AVA is sub-divided into the three smaller wine regions, each with distinctive growing conditions. They are Red Mountain AVA, Snipes Mountain AVA, and Rattlesnake Hills AVA.[19] Of the viticultural region's 665,000 acres (269,000 ha), nearly 11,120 acres (4,500 ha) were planted in 2008.[18] Yakima County leans Republican in statewide elections. On only four occasions has it backed a Democrat for President \u2013 it has voted for the same candidate as the state of South Dakota in every election since they first voted for President \u2013 and the last Democratic gubernatorial candidate it backed was Albert D. Rosellini in 1956.[20] Only Adams County and Columbia County, which last backed a Democrat for governor in 1936 when Clarence D. Martin swept every county in the state, have consistently backed Republicans for governor for longer.[20] Although Yakima County did narrowly support Maria Cantwell in 2012, the previous statewide candidate to carry Yakima County for the Democrats was popular Senator \"Scoop\" Jackson in 1982.[21]  Coordinates: 46°28\u2032N 120°44\u2032W﻿ / ﻿46.46°N 120.74°W﻿ / 46.46; -120.74","Title":"Yakima County, Washington - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2735","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima_County,_Washington"}
