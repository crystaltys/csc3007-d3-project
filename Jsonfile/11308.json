{"Content: ":"The Canberra Coronavirus Field Hospital is a temporary hospital in Canberra, Australia created in preparation of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.[1] The hospital was constructed by Aspen Medical,[2] a Canberra-based company specialising in temporary hospital construction,[3] and is located on Garran Oval to the northeast of the existing Canberra Hospital campus.[4] The project was announced on 9 April 2020.[5] At that time 84 patients in Canberra had been diagnosed with COVID-19, 9 of whom were in hospital.[6] Construction began that day[7][8] and was expected to cost A$23 million.[9] On 21 May 2020, the hospital was opened after only 37 days of construction.[10][11] Shortly after, on 24 May 2020, ACT health authorities announced the hospital would likely remain unused due to the successful prevention of a major outbreak in the territory.[12] This would also bring the cost of the project down to A$14 million.[13][14] On 14 February 2021, the ACT Government announced that the hospital, referred to as the \"Garran Surge Centre\", would be Canberra's vaccination hub for the Pfizer vaccine. [15] The facility will be staffed by 200 medical professionals, and will add 44 beds[16] and six resuscitation bays[17] to Canberra's medical system, making it a major part of the ACT Government's efforts to triple intensive care capacity from 50 to 170 beds.[18] Additionally, infrastructure like power, water, sewerage, and covered walkways connecting it to the Canberra Hospital are to be constructed for the facility.[17]","Title":"Canberra Coronavirus Field Hospital - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11308","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Coronavirus_Field_Hospital"}
