{"Content: ":"Pterosaur Beach is the name that paleontologists have given to an area along a long gone lagoon in what is now southwestern France. The area is notable because it is the first time that the fossil footprints of a landing pterosaur have been discovered. The fossil footprints are approximately 140 million years old.[1] The site has hundreds of fossilized pterosaur trackways.[2] The discovery was made by Jean-Michel Mazin from the University of Lyon.[3]  This article related to the Jurassic period is a stub.
