{"Content: ":"Bilateria/Triploblasts (unranked) Planulozoa is a clade which includes the Placozoa, Cnidaria (corals and jellyfish) and the Bilateria (all the more complex animals including flatworms, insects and vertebrates).[1][2] The designation Planulozoa may be considered a synonym to Parahoxozoa. Within Planulozoa, the Placozoa may be a sister of Cnidaria to the exclusion of Bilateria.[3][4][5][6] The clade excludes basal animals such as the Ctenophora (comb jellies),[7][8][2] and Porifera (sponges).[9][10][11] Although this clade was sometimes used to specify a clade of Cnidaria and Bilateria to the exclusion of Placozoa (against the original intention of its proposal), this is no longer favoured due to recent data indicating a sister group relationship between Cnidaria and Placozoa.[12] The phylogenetic tree indicates approximately how many millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split. Here, Planulozoa is shown sans Placozoa.[13][14][15] Planulozoa are associated with the emerge of the Zoc and ZF-NC gene domains.[16] Choanoflagellata Porifera Ctenophora Placozoa Cnidaria Xenacoelomorpha Chordata Ambulacraria Ecdysozoa Spiralia","Title":"Planulozoa - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1605","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planulozoa"}
