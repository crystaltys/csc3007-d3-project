The case was of the Omicron variant.[7] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[8][9] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[10][11] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[10][12] A former British protectorate since 1888, the Cook Islands along with Niue were annexed into the Realm of New Zealand on 11 June 1901. The Cook Islands became a self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand on 4 August 1965. While the Cook Islands are self-governing, they remain constitutionally part of the Realm of New Zealand.

The family and all other passengers tested negative on arrival to the Cook Islands.[3][4] On 5 December, The ten year patient was later determined to likely have been a non-infectious historic infection. At the time, the Cook Islands was considered 'covid-free'.[5] By 25 February 2022, the Cook Islands had reported a total of eight cases. Two of the most recent cases had arrived from New Zealand earlier in the month.[18] On 1 March, the Cook Islands reported 15 new cases, bringing the total number of cases to 25. In response, the Cook Islands Health Ministry (Te Marae Ora) also confirmed that 18 close contacts had tested positive for COVID-19 while in quarantine and had been placed in isolation. The Health Ministry also announced that they would be reducing isolation periods due to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant's shorter time period and to align the territory's COVID-19 response policies with New Zealand.[19] By 10 March, the Cook Islands had reported a total of 247 cases.

Travelers have to be present for at least 14 days in either NZ or the Cook Islands in order to participate in the travel bubble.[30] On 17 August 2021, the Cook Islands moved to Alert Level 2 following a New Zealand COVID-19 outbreak in Auckland.[31] This is the first time the Alert Level has been raised from Level 1 since the strengthened COVID-19 response system was introduced on 27 April 2021.[32] Within the first 5 days of following the Alert Level being raised 1788 PCR swabs for COVID-19 tests were processed targeting all passengers who arrived in the Cook Islands during 2\u201316 August 2021.
