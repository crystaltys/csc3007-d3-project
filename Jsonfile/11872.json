{"Content: ":"The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is an intergovernmental organization established to improve the interface between science and policy on issues of biodiversity and ecosystem services.[1] It is intended to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[2] In 2010 a resolution by the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly urged the United Nations Environment Programme to convene a plenary meeting to establish the IPBES.[3][4] In 2013 an initial conceptual framework was adopted for the prospective IPBES plenary.[4] From 29 April to 4 May 2019, representatives of the 132 IPBES members met in Paris, France, to receive the IPBES's full report[5] and adopted a summary of it for policymakers. On 6 May 2019, the 40-page summary was released.[6][7] On October 29, 2020 the organization issued a preliminary report through Zenodo on its workshop, held virtually on 27\u201331 July 2020,[11] that proposes a plan for international cooperation to lower risks for pandemics. Lowering the frequency and severity of pandemics through implementation of worldwide policies is the objective of the organization. An article on the report was published by Medical News Today on November 7, 2020, that explicates information in the report.[12] In June of 2021, IPBES and IPCC released a co-sponsored workshop report on biodiversity and climate change. The workshop produced a summary report covering outcomes[13] and a 250 page scientific outcome report.[14]","Title":"Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11872","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Science-Policy_Platform_on_Biodiversity_and_Ecosystem_Services"}
