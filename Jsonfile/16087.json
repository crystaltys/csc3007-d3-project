{"Content: ":"This is a list of interstate wars since 1945. Interstate warfare has been defined as military conflict between separate states over a territory.[1] This does not include civil wars and wars of independence, or smaller clashes with limited casualties (less than 100 combat deaths). The largest interstate war in history, World War II, involved most of the world's countries, after which the United Nations (UN) was established in 1945 to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts.[2] The period of the Cold War (1945\u20131991) was marked by the absence of major wars between the great powers of the period, the United States and the Soviet Union.[3][4][5] However, when the Cold War ended the same trends continued in what has also been called the \"New Peace\".[6] Overall, the number of international wars decreased from a rate of six per year in the 1950s to one per year in the 2000s, and the number of fatalities decreased from 240 reported deaths per million to less than 10 reported deaths per million.[7][8] The aggressor state is bolded when applicable.
