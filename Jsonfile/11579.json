{"Content: ":"Stichopterus is an extinct genus of chondrostean ray-finned fish that lived during the Early Cretaceous epoch in Asia.[1][2] It has been found in Russia (Murtoi Formation) and Mongolia.[2] The type species, Stichopterus woodwardi, was named and described in 1909. Since then, up to three other species have been named or were reallocated to Stichopterus, respectively.[3] Stichopterus is similar to Peipiaosteus from China. Both genera belong to the family Peipiaosteidae, together with Liaosteus, Spherosteus, and Yanosteus.[3][4] Peipiaosteidae are extinct relatives of Modern sturgeons and paddlefishes (Acipenseroidei).
