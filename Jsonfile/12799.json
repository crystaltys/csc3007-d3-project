{"Content: ":"115 Fifth Lane (commonly known as Fifth Lane) is the home of Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. It was built by Wickremesinghe's father, press baron Esmond Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe continues to live at Fifth Lane, using the Prime Minister's official residence, Temple Trees, only for official functions during his time as Prime Minister, with the exception of the 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis.[1][2][3] During Wickremesinghe's tenure as opposition leader, he met many foreign dignitaries at Fifth Lane. The living room of Fifth Lane was badly damaged on 23 March 1965 when a bomb was thrown into the house and exploded moments after Dudley Senanayake had left the premises while negotiations were underway to form a government. On July 9, 2022, protestors stormed the residence in response to the political and the economic crisis since 2019 after Wickremesinghe stated his willingness to resign to make way for an all-party government. The home was broken in by protestors and set on fire at just after 21:10 (16:40 BST). Wickremesinghe was not present during the arrival of protestors.[4][5] This article about a building or structure in Sri Lanka is a stub.
