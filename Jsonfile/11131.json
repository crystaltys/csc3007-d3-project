{"Content: ":"COVAX-19 (or SpikoGen) is the result of a collaboration between Vaxine and CinnaGen, a private company with operations in the Middle East. COVAX-19 is a recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by South Australian-based biotech company Vaxine. It is under clinical trial in collaboration with the Iranian company CinnaGen.[2][3][4] It requires two doses 21 days apart given by intramuscular injection.[3] COVAX-19 is a recombinant protein subunit.[5] Vaxine began work on a COVID-19 vaccine in January 2020. After developing a number of different types of vaccines, the company decided to focus on a \"recombinant protein-based vaccine\". A phase 1 human trial started in June 2020. The phase 1 trial involved 40 participants, 30 of whom received the vaccine. The remaining ten participants received a saline placebo.[6] Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials of COVAX-19 are being conducted in Iran under a co-operation agreement.[7] Phase 2 clinical trials started in May 2021 and Phase 3 trials commenced in August 2021. In the phase 2 trials, 400 Iranian volunteers were injected with either a placebo or the first dose of the vaccine. If the studies are successful, Vaxine will produce the vaccine under the name COVAX-19 in Australia and Cinnagen will produce the vaccine under the name SpikoGen in Iran.[6][8] On 6 October 2021, Iran approved the vaccine for emergency use.[14]  This article about COVID-19 vaccines is a stub.
