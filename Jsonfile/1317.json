{"Content: ":"In botanical nomenclature, variety (abbreviated var.; in Latin: varietas) is a taxonomic rank below that of species and subspecies, but above that of form.[1] As such, it gets a three-part infraspecific name. It is sometimes recommended that the subspecies rank should be used to recognize geographic distinctiveness, whereas the variety rank is appropriate if the taxon is seen throughout the geographic range of the species.[2] The pincushion cactus, Escobaria vivipara (Nutt.) Buxb., is a wide-ranging variable species occurring from Canada to Mexico, and found throughout New Mexico below about 2,600 metres (8,500 ft). Nine varieties have been described. Where the varieties of the pincushion cactus meet, they intergrade. The variety Escobaria vivipara var. arizonica is from Arizona, while Escobaria vivipara var. neo-mexicana is from New Mexico. See also Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum The term is defined in different ways by different authors.[3] However, the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants, while recognizing that the word \"variety\" is often used to denote \"cultivar\", does not accept this usage. Variety is defined in the code as follows: \"Variety (varietas) the category in the botanical nomenclatural hierarchy between species and form (forma)\". The code acknowledges the other usage as follows: \"term used in some national and international legislation for a clearly distinguishable taxon below the rank of species; generally, in legislative texts, a term equivalent to cultivar. See also: cultivar and variety (varietas)\".[4] A variety will have an appearance distinct from other varieties, but will hybridize freely with those other varieties (if brought into contact).[5]","Title":"Variety (botany) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1317","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"}
