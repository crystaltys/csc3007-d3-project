{"Content: ":"The Wetteraukreis is a Kreis (district) in the middle of Hesse, Germany. Neighbouring districts are Landkreis Gießen, Vogelsbergkreis, Main-Kinzig-Kreis, district-free Stadt Frankfurt, Hochtaunuskreis and Lahn-Dill-Kreis. The district was created in 1972 when the two districts Friedberg and Büdingen were merged. The district is located between the Taunus mountains and the Vogelsberg volcanic mountain. The main rivers of the district are the Nidda River and the Wetter River. The imperial eagle in the top of the coat of arms was chosen because the Wetterau was imperial possession in the past. The bars in the bottom derive from the lords of Isenburg-Büdingen, who owned most of the area. The wavy line depicts the river Wetter which flows through the capital Friedberg.
