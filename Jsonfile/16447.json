{"Content: ":"This is a list of streets renamed due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Following the invasion, One Philosophy consulting group together with Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched a campaign called \"Ukraine Street\", which calls for nations to change the name of the streets where the Russian embassy or consulate is located on to \"Ukraine Street\". Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the campaign part of an effort to \"isolate Russia and de-Putinize the world.\"[1] Malta has rejected the request to rename streets. The spokesperson of the local council of San Ä wann, Malta, where the Russian embassy is located, refused attempts of renaming as it would force residents of the street to change their addresses.[1] The naming committee of Stockholm Municipality also opposed calls to rename the street outside the Russian embassy \"Zelensky-gatan\" (Zelensky Street). Its chairperson Olle Zetterberg cited the fact that Stockholm streets are usually not named after a living person, and that there is no \"good reason\" to reject the current name.[2] The Netherlands stated that it would cost too much, and would cost much hassle and objections.[3] In Zaandam, in the Netherlands, some citizens changed some street names by themself by adding stickers on street signs; but were removed.[4] The same happened in a street in Prague, in the Czech Republic.[5] As a consequence of support to Ukraine from various countries, streets have also been renamed in Ukraine in their honor.[6]","Title":"List of streets renamed due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16447","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streets_renamed_due_to_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine"}
