{"Content: ":"Italy has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 47 times since making its debut at the first contest in 1956. It was one of the seven countries that competed at the first contest, which took inspiration from the Sanremo Music Festival.[1] Italy competed at the contest without interruption until 1980, discontinuing its participation on a number of occasions during the 1980s and 1990s. After a 13-year absence starting in 1998, the country returned to the contest in 2011. Italy has won the contest three times, along with an additional 15 top-five finishes. Italy hosted the contest in Naples (1965), Rome (1991) and Turin (2022). In 1958, Domenico Modugno finished third with the song \"Nel blu, dipinto di blu\". Renamed \"Volare\", the song became a huge international hit, topping the US Billboard Hot 100 and winning two Grammy Awards at its first edition. Emilio Pericoli also finished third in 1963, before Italy won for the first time in 1964 with Gigliola Cinquetti and \"Non ho l'età\". Cinquetti returned to the contest in 1974 and finished second with the song \"Sì\", losing to ABBA. Italy then finished third in 1975 with Wess and Dori Ghezzi and the song \"Era\". The country's best result of the 1980s was Umberto Tozzi and Raf finishing third in 1987. Italy's second victory in the contest came in 1990 with Toto Cutugno and the song \"Insieme: 1992\". Other good 1990s results were Mia Martini in 1992 and Jalisse in 1997, who both finished fourth. After 1997, Italy withdrew from the competition. On 31 December 2010, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Italy would be returning to the contest as part of the \"Big Five\", thereby granting the country automatic qualification for the final.[2] Italy's return to the contest has proved to be successful, finishing in the top ten in nine of the last eleven contests (2011\u201322), including second places for Raphael Gualazzi (2011) and Mahmood (2019), and third place for Il Volo (2015). Il Volo won the televote, receiving votes from all countries, but came sixth with the juries. This was the first time since the introduction of the mixed jury\u2013televote system in 2009 that the televote winner did not end up winning the contest. Italy achieved its third victory at the contest in 2021, with the rock band Måneskin and the song \"Zitti e buoni\". Italy has withdrawn from the Eurovision Song Contest a number of times. The first withdrawal was in 1981, when RAI stated that interest had diminished in the country.[3] This absence continued through 1982, before Italy returned in 1983. Italy again withdrew in 1986 when RAI decided not to enter the contest.[4] From 1994 to 1996, Italy withdrew again, with RAI citing a lack of interest in participating. Italy returned in 1997, before withdrawing again without explanation, and the country did not participate again until 2011.[5] None of the 20th century Eurovision-winning songs were particularly successful in the Italian charts. \"Non ho l'età\" by Gigliola Cinquetti was a hit in February 1964 when the song won the 1964 contest, but according to the official \"Hit Parade Italia\" website, \"Waterloo\", \"Ding-a-dong\", \"Puppet on a String\", \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" and even Italy's own winning entry of 1990, \"Insieme: 1992\", all failed to enter the top ten of the records sales charts. A notable exception to this rule was the 1984 entry \"I treni di Tozeur\" by Alice and Franco Battiato, which shared 5th place in the final, but still became a #3 hit in Italy and also placed at #20 on the chart of the best-selling Italian singles in 1984. RAI refused to broadcast the 1974 contest because their competing song, sung by Gigliola Cinquetti, coincided with the intense political campaigning for the 1974 Italian divorce referendum which was to be held a month later in May. Despite the Eurovision Song Contest taking place more than a month before the planned vote, Italian censors refused to allow the contest and song to be shown or heard. RAI censors felt that the song, titled \"Sì\" (Yes), and contained lyrics constantly repeating the aforementioned word could be subject to accusation of being subliminal messaging and a form of propaganda to influence the Italian voting public to vote 'yes' in the referendum (thus to repeal the law that allowed divorce).[6] The song thus remained censored on most Italian state TV and radio stations for over a month. At the contest in Brighton, Cinquetti finished second, losing to ABBA. \"Sì\" went on to be a UK top ten hit, peaking at number eight. It also reached the German top 20.[citation needed] In 2008, two notable Italian musicians, Vince Tempera (who was the conductor for Malta in 1975 and had helped San Marino take part in the ESC in 2008) and Eurovision winner Toto Cutugno expressed their sorrow at Italy's non-participation and called for the country to return to the contest.[7][8] Contestants from the 2008 contest, starting with the winner Dima Bilan appeared on the Italian show Carramba! Che fortuna, hosted by Raffaella Carrà on Rai Uno. Whether this was an initiative by Carrà (who presented three shows in TVE concerning the event) to try to bring Eurovision back to Italy is not clear, but Sietse Bakker, then-Manager Communications & PR of the Eurovision Song Contest, reiterated that \"Italy is still very much welcome to take part in the competition.\"[9][10] Shortly after revealing the list of participants for the 2009 contest, the EBU announced that they would work harder to bring Italy back into the contest, along with former participants Monaco and Austria.[11] At a press conference presenting the fourth edition of the Italian X Factor, Rai 2 director Massimo Liofredi announced that the winner of the competition might advance to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest, rather than participate in the Sanremo Festival, as in previous years. On 2 December 2010, it was officially announced by the EBU that Italy had applied to compete in the 2011 contest.[12] Their participation was further confirmed on 31 December with the announcement of the official participant list.[2] Italy's return to the contest after a 13-year absence has been successful, finishing in the top ten in nine of the last eleven contests (2011\u201322). In 2011, Raphael Gualazzi finished second, then Italy's best result since 1990. Italy came first with the jury vote, but only 11th in the televote to place second overall behind eventual winner Azerbaijan. Nina Zilli in 2012 and Marco Mengoni in 2013 were able to achieve a top 10 position (9th and 7th respectively); the latter, gathered 126 points, exactly doubling the points total of the other \"Big Five\" countries that year. This trend had a stop in 2014 when Emma Marrone, selected internally, ended in 21st place, worst placing ever for an Italian entry. In 2015, Sanremo winners Il Volo finished third with 292 points, behind winners Sweden and runners-up Russia. Italy placed first in the televote with 366 points, but sixth in the jury vote. Since the introduction of the 50/50 split voting system, this was the first time that the televote winner did not win the contest overall. Francesca Michielin, selected among the competitors of Sanremo 2016 after the waiver of the winners Stadio, ended in 16th place. Francesco Gabbani, a fan-favourite with \"Occidentali's Karma\", came in 6th place in 2017. The year after, although not initially a big favourite with the bookmakers, Ermal Meta and Fabrizio Moro returned Italy to the top 5 with \"Non mi avete fatto niente\", aided significantly by finishing third in the televote, which heavily counterbalanced the 17th place by the jury, finishing fifth overall. In 2019, Mahmood with \"Soldi\" placed second with 472 points, Italy's best result since 2011, until Måneskin with \"Zitti e buoni\" won the contest in 2021 with 524 points. Måneskin's victory marked the band's breakthrough on the international music scene. Mahmood returned as the host entrant in 2022 alongside Blanco, placing sixth with \"Brividi\". The video for \"Occidentali's Karma\" by Francesco Gabbani is the first Eurovision song to reach more than 200 million views on YouTube, while \"Zitti e buoni\" by Måneskin and \"Soldi\" by Mahmood are the second and third most-streamed Eurovision song on Spotify, respectively.[13] In addition, the live performance of \"Zitti e buoni\" is the most viewed live performance on the Eurovision YouTube channel.[14] The Sanremo Music Festival is the most popular Italian song contest and awards ceremony, held annually in the city of Sanremo, Liguria. First held in 1951 and itself the basis and inspiration for the Eurovision Song Contest, the festival has often been used as a method of choosing the Italian entry for the European contest, with some exceptions over the years. Since 2015, the winner of the festival has been given the right of first refusal to represent Italy in the contest.[1][15] Since 1999, four countries \u2013 France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom \u2013 have automatically qualified for the Eurovision final regardless of their results in previous contests.[16] These countries earned this special status by being the four biggest financial contributors to the EBU, and subsequently became known as the \"Big Four\". In a meeting with OGAE Serbia in 2007, then-Executive Supervisor of the Contest Svante Stockselius stated that, if Italy were to return to the contest in the future, the country would also automatically qualify for the final, becoming part of a \"Big Five\".[17][18] However, with the official announcement of the return of Italy, it was not confirmed whether the country would compete in one of the two semi-finals or be part of the \"Big Five\", as RAI, third largest contributor to the EBU, had not applied for \"Big Five\" membership.[19] On 31 December 2010, it was announced that Italy would take part in the 2011 contest and confirmed that the country would automatically qualify for the final as part of the \"Big Five\".[2] Italy is currently the most successful Big Five country in the Eurovision Song Contest following the introduction of the rule, finishing in the top ten in nine of the last eleven contests (2011\u201322), including a victory for Måneskin (2021), second places for Raphael Gualazzi (2011) and Mahmood (2019), and third place for Il Volo (2015). They are one of the only two countries of the Big Five \u2013 since it was introduced \u2013 to have won, the other being Germany in 2010.
