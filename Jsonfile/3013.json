He rose to fame in North America with the 1983 top ten album Cuts Like a Knife, featuring its title track and the ballad \"Straight From the Heart\", his first US top ten hit. His 1984 Canadian and US number one album, Reckless (which became the first album by a Canadian to be certified diamond in Canada), made him a global star with tracks like \"Run to You\" and \"Summer of '69\", both top ten hits in the US and Canada, and the power ballad \"Heaven\", a US number one hit.[7] His 1987 album Into the Fire, with its US and Canadian top ten song, \"Heat of the Night\", rose to number two in Canada and the top ten in the US and several other countries. In 1991, Adams released \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", which went to number one in at least 19 countries, including for 16 and 18 straight weeks in the UK, and Europe overall, both records.[8] It is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.[9] The song was included on Adams' Waking Up the Neighbours (1991), a worldwide number one album that sold 16 million copies, including being certified diamond in Canada.[10] Another major hit off the album was the Canadian number one and US number two hit \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\", which also went top ten in several other countries.

Adams,[19] who emigrated to Canada from Plymouth, England in the 1950s.[21] Adams' father, a Sandhurst officer in the British Army, joined the Canadian Army and later worked as a United Nations peacekeeping observer and as a Canadian foreign service diplomat.[21] Adams travelled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Lisbon, Portugal (where he attended the American International School of Lisbon)[22] and Vienna, Austria (where he attended the American International School of Vienna), during the 1960s, and to Tel Aviv, Israel during the early 1970s.[23][24] Raised in Ottawa, Adams attended Colonel By Secondary School in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of East Ottawa.[25] In 1974, Adams, his mother, and younger brother Bruce moved to North Vancouver, while his father was posted abroad. While there, he attended Argyle Secondary School and Sutherland Secondary School.[26][27] Adams bought his first electric guitar at the age of 12 in Reading, an Italian brand from Gherson, based on a Fender stratocaster.[28] In an interview with music magazine Guitar World, Adams said: \"I bought an imitation Les Paul at a Five and Dime store in Ottawa, Canada, in 1971,\" Adams recalled. \"Before that, I had an imitation Strat which I bought in Reading, England in 1970.\" It felt real at the time to have a Les Paul, even though I'm a massive Ritchie Blackmore fan - still am. I was heavily into Humble Pie's Rockin' the Fillmore album at the time, and both Peter Frampton and Steve Marriott were on Les Pauls. It's rock guitar heaven, that album.\"[29] He left school to play in a group called \"Shock\" and used the funds his parents had saved for his college education to buy an Estey grand piano to tinker with.[30] At one point he sold pet food and worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant, which paid the rent.[31][32] He got into different bands such as CCR and Deep Purple, and attended concerts by Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, Elton John, and Tina Turner. He started working in the Vancouver music scene with bands and as a studio session singer. At the age of 15, he became the vocalist for a pub band, Sweeney Todd.[33] \"I met Bryan Adams by chance at Long & McQuade, a Vancouver music store, in January 1978. I was there with a friend musician Ali Monroe. She knew Bryan and she introduced us. We swapped phone numbers, got together a couple of days later, and over the next eleven years wrote dozens of songs for Bryan and a long list of recordings for other artists.\" \u2014Jim Vallance, tells how they met with Adams and how their collaboration began.[34] Adams recorded \"Roxy Roller\" which came in at No. 99 on the US charts.[35] This new incarnation of the band also released an album If Wishes Were Horses (1977) with Adams billed as \"Bryan Guy Adams\" on vocals.[36] Adams left the band at age 16.[33] In 1978, at age 18, Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver Long and McQuade musical instrument store.[37] Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism, and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later. This proved to be the beginning of a partnership which was prolific and continuous through the 1980s, together they co-wrote for Adams and a long list of recordings for other artists, including Kiss, Tina Turner, Joe Cocker, Johnny Hallyday, Bonnie Raitt, Rod Stewart, Bonnie Tyler, Loverboy, Carly Simon and Neil Diamond to name a few,[38] and while discontinuous, as of 2017[update], is still in existence.[39][40] Later in 1978, Adams signed to A&M records for one dollar.[41] A&M remixed one of Adams' demos as a disco song \"Let Me Take You Dancing\", featuring Adams' vocals sped up to meet the 122 BPM dance tempo. The song made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 along with its B-side \"Don't Turn Me Away\".[42] In 1979, he made an agreement with Canadian manager Bruce Allen, who at that time also worked for Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive and Loverboy, to this day he is still his manager.[43][44] Adams's self-titled debut album, mostly co-written with Jim Vallance, was released in February 1980. With the exception of \"Remember\" and \"Wastin' Time\", most of the album was recorded in October and November 1979 at Manta Studios and co-produced by Adams and Vallance.[34] The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986.[45] Singles released from it included \"Give Me Your Love\", \"Remember\" and \"Hidin' from Love\", with the latter having the most success, reaching number 64 on the Canadian RPM Current Hit Radio chart; none reached the US Billboard Hot 100. Adams's second album, You Want It You Got It, was released in 1981 and contained the FM album-oriented rock radio hit, \"Lonely Nights\", which reached number three on the US Album Rock Tracks chart.[46] The same song was reinterpreted by Uriah Heep for the album Head First, released in 1983.[47][48] The most successful song off the album in Canada was \"Fits Ya Good\" which reached the top 30 on the RPM Top 40 Chart; it also reached number 15 on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. From January to May 1982, Adams spent months traveling on his \"You Want It You Got It Tour\"; within a few months the album had been picked up across the United States and Adams was soon on tour doing clubs and noon hour concerts for radio stations, as well as support to such acts as The Kinks and Foreigner.[49] Cuts Like a Knife, which was released in January 1983, was Adams's breakout album.[50] \"Straight from the Heart\" was the first single released from the album; it reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100,[51][52] number 20 on the Canadian RPM Top 40 chart, and number one on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.[53] In September 1983, Bonnie Tyler released her version for the studio album Faster Than the Speed of Night.[54] The second single, \"Cuts Like a Knife\", rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, number six on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart,[55] and number 12 on the Canadian RPM Top 40 Chart. The third single, \"This Time\", was also a top 30 hit in the US and Canada. Overseas, the latter two singles were both Top 20 hits in New Zealand, but there was little success in any other countries, aside from \"Straight From the Heart\" and \"This Time\" reaching the top 50 in the UK. Three other tracks, \"Take Me Back\", \"I'm Ready\" and \"The Only One\", also received substantial airplay on North American rock radio stations, each making the US Album Rock Tracks chart. The album peaked at number eight on both the Billboard 200 album chart[56] and in Canada, achieving three times platinum status in Canada, platinum status in the United States and gold status in Australia.[45][51][57] In August, Adams began recording his third album at Vancouver's Little Mountain Sound Studios.[49] In October, Adams joined Jim Vallance at the Yamaha Music Festival in Japan.

The video is directed by Steve Barron with photography by László Kovács.[49] In May 1983, he briefly interrupted the tour with Journey to direct the club The Bottom Line in New York City.[49] In the audience were Mick Jagger, Nils Lofgren, Rick Nielson (Cheap Trick), Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and John McEnroe.[49] Paul Dean of Loverboy, John Waite and Rick Derringer joined him on stage.[49] On July 30, 1983, he performed at Day on the Green, sharing the stage with Journey, Triumph, Eddie Money and Night Ranger.[58][59] In August 1983, Adams's tour with Journey concluded, and in September 1983 Adams performed with Supertramp in front of a crowd of over 30,000 Vancouver fans at BC Place.[49] In the following months he performed in eleven countries on a six-week solo tour of Europe. While in Germany, he records the popular rock TV show \"Rockpalast\".[49] In November 1983, Adams is on tour in Japan and by the end of the year he had performed 283 concerts. A&M released the film soundtrack of the album \"A Night in Heaven\", with the power ballad \"Heaven\",[49] on it. \"Heaven\" reached number nine on the US AOR Rock Tracks chart and became the title of a \"SOR\" tour of Western Canada.[49] In December 1983, his numerous music industry awards for the year include Best Selling New Artist (The National Association of Record Merchandisers), number two Male AOR Artist (The Album Network) and number three most played album AOR (Radio & Records), as well as the Juno Awards for the best male singer.[49] In January 1984, Adams and Vallance began writing for the next album, while in February 1984 Adams toured Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii with The Police.[49] The album Reckless was released in late 1984, and peaked at number one on both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Album Chart, while reaching number two in Australia and number seven in the UK.[60] The album featured six singles: \"Run to You\", \"Somebody\", \"Heaven\", \"Summer of '69\", \"One Night Love Affair\", and \"It's Only Love\", a duet with the female star and \"Queen of Rock 'n' Roll\" Tina Turner.[61][62] All six singles peaked in the Top 15 of the US Billboard Hot 100, only the third album to achieve this[62] with the rockers \"Run to You\" (number six) and \"Summer of '69\" (number five) peaking in the top ten, and the ballad \"Heaven\" reaching number one. \"Run To You\" was the most successful single at album-oriented rock stations in the US, as it spent four weeks at the top of the mainstream rock tracks chart; \"Somebody\" reached number one for a single week on that chart; while \"It's Only Love\" and \"One Light Love Affair\" each rose to number 7. \"Summer of '69\" had gotten a minor amount of airplay upon the initial release of the album, making it ineligible to re-chart on the mainstream rock track chart when it was released as single in summer 1985. \"Run To You\" was the biggest hit off Reckless in Canada reaching number four, with \"Summer of '69\" and \"Heaven\" both peaking at number 11, \"Somebody\" peaking at number 13, \"It's Only Love\" hitting number 14, and \"One Night Love Affair\" reaching number 19. \"Summer of 69\" also reached the top ten in New Zealand and Norway, and the Top 20 in Sweden, Australia and Austria, but only peaked at number 42 in the UK and number 62 in West Germany. Adams has stated that \"Summer of '69\" was not a success when initially released in the UK because British radio stations did not add it to their play lists like they had \"Run To You\".[63] However, it gained popularity over time and was certified Platinum (600,000) in sales in the UK in 2019, and its Spotify streams were at 280 million as of 2019, twice that of \"(Everything I Do) I Do For You.\"[63] In the Low Countries it achieved its maximum popularity in 1990 when it peaked at number 4 in 17 weeks on the Netherlands' singles chart,[64] and reached number 8 on the Belgium chart.[65] \"It's Only Love\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group in 1986. In 1986, the song won an MTV award for Best Stage Performance.[66][67] Reckless also earned Adams a Grammy nomination for Best Male Rock Performance.[24] In December 1984, Adams embarked on a two-year world tour to launch the album starting in Canada and United States, then into Japan, Australia, back to the UK, where for dates he supported Tina Turner for her Private Dancer Tour, and again to Canada. After winning four Juno Awards, he headed south towards the American West Coast, culminating with two dates at the Paladium in Los Angeles.[68][failed verification] Reckless eventually went Diamond in sales in Canada, the first album by a Canadian artist to do so, while reaching 5× and 3× Platinum in the US and UK. Reckless has sold over 12 million copies worldwide, and won the Juno Award for Album of the Year.[69] 1985 was an intense and demanding year.

It also finished number one on the year-end Canadian charts for 1985. The song's video also received extensive airplay on MuchMusic. Participation was incredible: the single went triple platinum immediately,[72] although independently recorded by the USA for Africa project, it was included in the full-length We Are the World album. On July 13, Adams attended the Live Aid concert, from Philadelphia.[73] He took the stage at JFK Stadium in front of over 100,000 people and the band played \"Kids Wanna Rock\", \"Summer Of '69\" and \"Cuts Like A Knife\", before concluding with \"Tears Are Not Enough\".[74] Bryan Adams sang a small passage of this song on Live 8 in Barrie during All For Love.[75] In September 1985, Adams worked on Roger Daltrey's sixth solo album Under a Raging Moon. The album was a tribute to The Who's drummer Keith Moon, who died in 1978.[76] Adams co-wrote two tracks for the album: \"Let Me Down Easy\" and \"Rebel\".[77][78] The track \"Let Me Down Easy\" was a Top 15 Hit on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks. Nearly 30 years later, Adams would release his own version of \"Let Me Down Easy\" on a 30-year anniversary version of Reckless.[79] In January 1986, Adams provided the ending background vocals to the song \"Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)\" by Canadian rock band Glass Tiger for their debut album The Thin Red Line. It reached number one in Canada and number two in the United States.[80] His follow-up album to Reckless was Into the Fire (1987).

It has conquered a relatively unknown market.[49] In December 1990, recording continued in England for most of the month. Adams returned home for vacation with family and friends. Live! Live! Live! was certified gold in Japan, commemorating the sale of over 50,000 units.[49] At the beginning of 1991, Adams returned to London on the sixth to start mixing with Mutt Lange. The release date for Waking Up The Neighbors was scheduled for the end of April. European festival dates have been announced with ZZ Top in June.[49] In the months of February and March 1991, the recording and mixing continued in London.

Adams joins them in the studio to lend vocals and guitar tracks.[49] In April 1991, Adams and Mutt Lange wrote and recorded \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" for the Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves soundtrack.[49] In May 1991, directed by Julien Temple, the video for the song was shot in Sheffield, England on May 17 and 18. Rehearsals for the next European tour began with ZZ Top. In June 1991, a video was shot for the first single album \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\" 'directed by Kevin Godley at Pinewood Studios in London. On the eighth, Adams kicked off the headlining tour at the \"Jubeck Festival\" in Germany.[49] On the 17th, he performed a private show for a personal service recently returned from the Gulf War at the Canadian Armed Forces base in Baden Baden, Germany. On September 24, 1991, the album Waking Up the Neighbours was released. Co-produced by Adams and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, it topped the charts around the world, including in the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany and reached number six on the Billboard 200.[89][51] It became Adams's second album to be certified Diamond in sales in Canada while being certified 5× platinum in the US. It went on to sell 16 million copies worldwide.[10] Waking up the Neighbors became the first album by a Canadian since Neil Young's 1972 Harvest to reach the top of the album charts in the United Kingdom. Ironically, however, the album was launched in Canada amidst a storm of controversy. The album is also known to have caused controversy in Canada due to the Canadian Content system.[90] This indicated that a certain percentage must be broadcast by Canadian music on Canadian radio and television broadcasts. Since Waking Up the Neighbors was largely recorded in England and co-produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange (originally from Zambia), the album and its songs, under the rules in effect until 1991, were not thoughtful purely Canadian productions.[90] The album managed to reach the top of the Canadian charts.[90] Following Adams' complaints, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced that the Canadian content rules would be expanded. The old regulation for collaborative writing between Canadians and non-Canadians where the lyricist and musical composer worked separately. In September 1991, the regulation was optimized to recognize unions in which two (or more) contributors each contributed to both lyrics and music, as was the case with Adams and Lange. In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada's annual Juno Awards, where his album was eventually almost completely ignored by the awards committee. He did end up winning the Juno International Achievement Award, Canadian Entertainer of the Year (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award.[91] The album's first single was the world-wide number one song, the six-and-a-half-minute \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", which was featured in the motion picture Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.[92] \"Everything I Do\" was released internationally on June 12th, days after the film's premiere, with the initial shipment of 385,000 copies being the largest single shipment in the history of A&M Records. While the film recorded the eighth best debut weekend in film history, the single debuted at number one in all radio formats, from rock to contemporary hits.[49] This rock ballad spent a record 16 consecutive weeks at Number One on the UK Singles Chart, ten weeks on top of the Australian singles chart, nine weeks at the top of the Canadian Singles Chart, and seven weeks at the Billboard singles chart's summit, his second number one on that chart. The song also gave him his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Song from a Motion Picture.[93] Subsequent singles were the mid-tempo \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\" which peaked at number two in the US, the ballad \"Do I Have to Say the Words?\" which reached number 11 in the US, and in the UK, \"Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven\" was the second most successful single as it peaked at number 8. In Canada, the first three of these singles each reached number one on the Canadian Singles Chart while the latter and the rocker \"There Will Never Be Another Tonight\" peaked at No. 2. The album won many awards including a Grammy Award in 1991 for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.[51][94] In July 1992, Adams performed at Wembley Stadium in front of 80,000 fans, the largest audience on his tour, with Little Angels and Extreme serving as opening acts. Adams performed for the first time ever in Hungary and Turkey. Part of the video for \"Do I Have To Say The Words\" directed by Anton Corbijn, was shot at İnönü Stadium, where the first concert in the history of the stadium was held, with a crowd of over 40,000 people, in the city of Istanbul and in Iceland.[49] In 1993, Adams collaborated with Rod Stewart and Sting for the single \"All for Love\" co-written by Adams for the soundtrack of the film The Three Musketeers.[95] The single topped the charts worldwide.[96][97] On June 15, 1993, along with some rock and blues legends such as Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Ray Charles and Ella Fitzgerald, Adams took the stage of the Apollo Theater in Harlem for a tribute to the great master of soul Sam Cooke. During the gala, he was joined on stage by Smokey Robinson for a duet of Bring It On Home to Me.[98] In November 1993, Adams released a compilation album entitled So Far So Good, that again topped the charts in numerous countries such as the UK, Canada, Germany and Australia. It was certified 6×, 3×, 6× and 11× Platinum, respectively, in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.[99] It included a new song called \"Please Forgive Me\", that became another number one single in Australia, Canada and the UK, as well as reaching number seven in the US (although it reached number one on the Adult Contemporary Chart). In 1994, Adams embarked on a long tour that takes him to Southeast Asia, during which he became the first Western artist to perform in Vietnam since James Brown played there in 1971 at the end of the war.[100] Adams was also invited to participate in another important musical event: the Elvis Aaron Presley \u2013 The Tribute concert, held in Memphis in homage to the king of rock 'n' roll Elvis Presley. During the evening, which included dozens of exponents of the most varied musical genres, including Jeff Beck, Jerry Lee Lewis, Michael Bolton, Paul Rodgers, Melissa Etheridge, he sang one of his favorite songs: \"Hound Dog\".[101] In September 1994, he was invited by Luciano Pavarotti to participate in the benefit concert Pavarotti & Friends. The concert took place in Modena at the \"Parco di Piazza D'Armi Novi Sad\". They performed with Andreas Vollenweider, Nancy Gustafson, Giorgia and Andrea Bocelli.

This solo version had been on my computer for years (about 15 years), and when I heard that the creative director of Sony Music, longtime producer and friend of Aretha's Clive Davis, was making a movie about his life, I sent him this version. The world hadn't heard her full performance yet and it really needed to be heard.

Adams recruited Jim Vallance, and the two of them spent the next two years writing the music and lyrics, and completed the songs in March 2018. The musical made its debut on Broadway in August 2018 and opened in London's West End on February 13, 2020.[200] \"When I think of Bryan Adams, I think of a great storyteller who writes the kind of songs that make me want to sing. Known for his killer, gritty voice, Bryan is a t-shirt and blue jeans guy who wrote some truly unforgettable melodies. \u2014 Matt Williams, of Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy in 2020.[201] Gifted with a powerful hoarse voice, with a particularly recognizable timbre, Bryan Adams began his career in the mid-1970s, taking over from original singer Nick Gilder of Sweeney Todd, when he was a teenager and had a youthful voice very far from the standards he has achieved over the years. With Vallance's help, it wasn't long before Adams established a powerful and distinct sound, compared to that of Joe Elliott, Rod Stewart, Paul Rodgers and Steve Marriott.[202] Adams' voice is often taken as an example of comparing similarities between different singers Rod Stewart, Joe Cocker, Richard Marx and Don Henley. Recognized as one of rock's greatest performers, he is considered among the best live singers.[203][204][205] Adams has played various styles of rock, from hard rock and arena rock to pop rock and soft rock. During the first few years of his career in the 1970s Adams fronted Canadian glam rock band Sweeney Todd; the band played hard rock as well as glam rock.[33] His early songs were about kids and about the lives of young people, and he is known for his romantic ballads. Adams has never shied away from political or social commentary, especially with songs such as \"Native Son\" and \"Remembrance Day\" from the album Into the Fire,[206] \"Don't Drop That Bomb on Me\" from Waking Up the Neighbours, and \"Ultimate Love\" from Ultimate. In 1978, after meeting with the drummer and main songwriter Jim Vallance for Canadian rock band Prism under the pseudonym \"Rodney Higgs\",[207] the initial course was quite difficult. Demos of Adams' early songs were rejected by numerous record companies. In 1978, the Adams\u2013Vallance duo managed to sign their record deal with A&M Records and released the single \"Let Me Take You Dancing\". It is notable for being Adams' first solo single and his first-ever release as a solo artist, when he was 19.[208] The genre of the single was disco; the melody, a piano riff inspired by Robbie King, was composed by Vallance on his parents' piano during the Christmas holidays in 1977; Adams, meanwhile, helped turn the riff into a song. In 1982, Vallance and Adams received a call from producer Michael James Jackson to contribute some songs for the next Kiss album. Although Vallance and Adams were not fans of heavy metal, it was a golden opportunity for exposure for their songs by a world-class rock group. In collaboration with Gene Simmons, the track \"War Machine\" and a rewrite \"Rock 'n Roll Hell\" were recorded by Kiss for the album Creatures of the Night.[209] Adams' first solo albums, Bryan Adams and You Want It You Got It, two clear-cut rock and hard rock albums, respectively, indicated the styles that Adams would become famous for.[210] In 1983, with the release of Cuts Like a Knife, Reckless and Into the Fire, their music was characterized by being hard rock with melodic overtones and powerful ballads (known as power ballads); the production of the first five albums was in cooperation with the American record producer Bob Clearmountain.[211][212] In the 1990s, with the release of Waking Up the Neighbours in 1991, produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, they left the hard rock sound and released an album closer to classic rock and roll, taking inspiration from the sounds of bands and artists such as Def Leppard and Foreigner.[213] This album is based on these tones, which brings out a leap in notoriety and also in musical quality to the Canadian rocker, placing itself right in the middle between the sounds of and those of \"18 Til 'I Die\". Without forgetting that just after \"Wakin 'up the Neighbors\" will come the best So Far So Good, assisted by this album, which churns out some of the singles that Adams fans.[214] In 1996, with his album 18 til I Die, Adams and Lange adopted a pop rock sound more in line with the style of the time. Many ballads were included in this work, although it also contained some rock songs such as \"18 til I Die\" and \"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\".[215][216] The album sees the collaboration of the American singer and songwriter Gretchen Peters, still active today. In 1998, On a Day Like Today was released, co-produced by his compatriot Bob Rock, he opted for a sound oriented to pop rock, heavily influenced by contemporary bands. Upon their return in 2000 with the album Room Service, Adams produced the album and co-wrote the songs with various co-writers, the themes of the songs being varied between street life, touring, truth, love and relationships. He again opted for a rock-oriented sound. In 2008, with 11, produced by the same Adams with the collaboration of Mutt lange, he sees the return of his long-time collaborator Jim Vallance after more than 15 years, he has experienced a sound softer, combining songs from soft rock, pop rock and melodic rock.[217] With Get Up produced entirely by Jeff Lynne, they continued in the line of rock, with the strong influence of Lynne's fifty-year experience.[218] In 2019, with Shine a Light, he combined rock with pop rock and R&B.[219] \"If I were to record the songs that were the real influences in my life, I would record a lot of hard rock from the 70s, \"says Adams. \"And most of those songs are untouchable. There are many reasons why I wanted to pick up a guitar,\" says Adams. \"One of them was the Machine Head album, by Ritchie Blackmore and Deep Purple\". \u2014Bryan Adams, in 2014.[220] Among his youthful influences, the musician has often mentioned Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan as well as all the pop and rock heard as a boy on the radio. While making the album cover version Tracks of My Years, the album was released in 2014, Adams in an interview published by the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, Adams said the real influences in my life, I would record a lot of hard rock from the 1970s. According to Adams, most of those songs are untouchable.[220] His main sources of inspiration also include guitarists, besides Blackmore, he was influenced by guitarists such as Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Mick Ronson, Jeff Beck, Peter Frampton and Eddie Van Halen.

And of course, my motto has always been If you love animals, don't eat them. I'm opposed to fur and any kind of use of animal products. I don't eat them, and I don't wear them. I'm not for the killing of any creature-whether it be seals, cows, dogs, anything. So anytime it comes to any kind of animal cruelty, I'm totally against it. Being sympathetic to animal rights is just something that came very naturally to me. But the moment I began to understand what was going on with the treatment of animals, it led me more and more in the way of the path I am [on] now, which is a complete vegan.\"[270] In April 2019, while off the coast of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Adams physically intervened to protect a whale from being killed when local whalers tried to harpoon it within a conservation zone.[271] He is the president of the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Environment Fund, a non-profit company registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to support sustainable initiatives to promote the preservation of the beauty and natural value of the islands.[272] In May 2020, Adams was criticized for a profane social media post blaming the COVID-19 pandemic on \"bat eating\".[273] Even though Adams did not single out any particular race in his remarks, online response was immediate and \"Bryan Adams racist\" began trending on social media.[274] Adams later apologized for the comments stating, \"To any and all that took offence...No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet-markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism.
