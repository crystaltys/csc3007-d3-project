Although the movie studio and the music business share a common history, today the former is part of NBCUniversal and the latter an independent commercial entity.[16][17] The Decca Record Co. Ltd. of England spun American Decca off in 1939.[18] MCA Inc. merged with American Decca in 1962.[19] In November 1990, Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric agreed to acquire MCA for $6.59 billion.[20][21] In 1995, Seagram acquired 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita.[22][23] On December 9, 1996, the company was renamed Universal Studios, Inc.,[24] and its music division was renamed Universal Music Group; MCA Records continued as a label within the Universal Music Group.

The vault held masters for the MCA, ABC, A&M, Geffen and Interscope labels; as well as some smaller subsidiary labels.
