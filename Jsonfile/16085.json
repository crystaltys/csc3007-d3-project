{"Content: ":"The 2022 Russian mystery fires are a series of unusual fires and explosions that have occurred since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine,[1][2] which have not been formally explained.[3] There have also been several notable arson attacks on military recruitment offices in Russia since the beginning of the war,[4] and there has been speculation that some of the fires or explosions have been the result of sabotage efforts by Ukraine.[5] A \"yellow\" (medium) terrorist threat level was introduced[6] in Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod Oblasts, as well as some districts of Voronezh Oblast, Krasnodar Krai, and northern Crimea. Starting from the end of March, a series of incidents and explosions were reported in border regions of Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, and Voronezh Oblasts. Russian officials reported on mortar shelling, drone attacks, and helicopter gunship attacks allegedly coming \"from the Ukrainian side\".[ru 1][7][8] The Ukrainian side refused to confirm or deny involvement in incidents at strategic locations.[9] There were allegations that some of the fires or explosions were the result of Ukrainian sabotage.[10] In May, a series of incidents on railway lines in Russia impeded the deployment of troops and military equipment to Ukraine; responsibility for these incidents was claimed by the Internet movement \"Stop the Trains\"[ru 2] (a reference to the Russian anti-war slogan \"Stop the War\").[ru 3][11]  This Russia-related article is a stub.
