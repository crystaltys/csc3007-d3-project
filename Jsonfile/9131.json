{"Content: ":"The State of the World\u2019s Cash 2020[1] is a publication by CALP Network that reports on the use of cash and voucher assistance in humanitarian aid. It was written by Jose Jodar, Anna Kondakhchyan, Ruth McCormack, Karen Peachey, Laura Phelps and Gaby Smith.[2] The report follows on from \u2018The State of the World\u2019s Cash Report\u2019, a seminal piece published by CALP in 2018.[3] The report reflects on progress made against global policy commitments made by the Grand Bargain, ECHO\u2019s 10 Principles,[4] the High Level Panel on Cash[5] and the World Bank\u2019s Strategic Note on Cash Transfers in Humanitarian Contexts among others.[6] These and other policy commitments are summarised in the Global Framework for Action: A Consolidated Summary of Commitments for Cash Transfer Programming[7] which provides the overall structure to the State of the World\u2019s Cash Report with additional chapters to reflect new trends and issues. This document is widely cited and used both by policy makers and practitioners. It is a source referenced in the annual review of progress against Grand Bargain commitments[8][9] and in multiple other authoritative research, policy and guidance reports.[10][11][12][13][14] It documents how the use of cash and voucher assistance (CVA) in humanitarian aid has doubled from US$2.8 billion in 2016, to $5.6 billion in 2019, representing 17.9% of spending on humanitarian assistance. Chapter by chapter it examines progress made on priority issues and includes recommendations for humanitarian policy makers and practitioners.","Title":"The State of the World's Cash 2020 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9131","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_of_the_World%E2%80%99s_Cash_2020"}
