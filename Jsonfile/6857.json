{"Content: ":"Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (often shortened to Debevoise) is an international law firm headquartered in New York City. Founded in 1931 by Harvard Law School alumnus Eli Whitney Debevoise and Oxford-trained William Stevenson, the firm was originally named \u201cDebevoise, Plimpton & McLean\u201d. Debevoise specializes in private equity, M&A, insurance and financial services transactions, private funds, complex litigation, investigations, and international arbitration.[2] In 2021, the firm assisted the Democratic Party in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump.[3] Debevoise & Plimpton currently employs approximately 769 lawyers in nine offices throughout the world. The firm divides its practices into three major areas: Corporate, Litigation, and Tax. In recent years, the firm's practice has taken on an increasingly international component. Debevoise & Plimpton has offices across three continents, locations include New York City, Washington D.C., London, Paris, Frankfurt, Moscow, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. In 2016, Debevoise opened a new office in Tokyo.[4] On June 1, 2020, Debevoise & Plimpton announced the opening of an office in Luxembourg.[5] Debevoise is the only law firm in the world to have both a former US and UK Attorney-General simultaneously as partners (Michael Mukasey in the U.S. and Lord Goldsmith QC in the U.K.).[6] Debevoise & Plimpton is consistently among the most profitable large law firms in the world on a per-partner and per-lawyer basis according to American Lawyer magazine's annual AmLaw 100 Survey. Debevoise was placed overall No. 1 in The American Lawyer's \"10-Year A-List,\" a ranking of the law firms who have earned the highest cumulative score on the A-List since its inception in 2003. The annual A-List ranks firms according to their performance in four categories: revenue per lawyer, pro bono service, associate satisfaction, and diversity.[7] Attorneys from Debevoise & Plimpton worked on behalf of prisoners held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.[9][10][11] Jeff Lang, of Debevoise & Plimpton, was one of the first Guantanamo Bay attorneys to file an appeal in the Federal appeal court in Washington DC of prisoners' Combatant Status Review Tribunal proceedings. The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 included provision for prisoners to challenge whether the Tribunals' decisions complied with the Tribunal's mandate. Charles \"Cully\" Stimson, then Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, stirred controversy when he went on record criticizing the patriotism of law firms that allowed employees to assist Guantanamo prisoners: \"corporate CEOs seeing this should ask firms to choose between lucrative retainers and representing terrorists.\"[12] Stimson's views were widely criticized. The Pentagon disavowed them, and Stimson resigned shortly thereafter. [16][17]","Title":"Debevoise & Plimpton - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6857","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debevoise_%26_Plimpton"}
