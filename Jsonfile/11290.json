{"Content: ":"Zeta variant, also known as lineage P.2,[a] is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was first detected in the state of Rio de Janeiro; it harbors the E484K mutation, but not the N501Y and K417T mutations. It evolved independently in Rio de Janeiro without being directly related to the Gamma variant from Manaus.[1][2] Under the simplified naming scheme proposed by the World Health Organization, P.2 was labeled \"Zeta variant\", and was considered a variant of interest (VOI), but not a variant of concern.[3] A second wave was preceded in November 2020 by an increase in the prevalence of the Zeta variant among genetic sequences from SÃ£o Paulo state, deposited into the GISAID database.[4] As of July 2021, Zeta is no longer considered a variant of interest by the WHO.[5] The Zeta genome has 3 amino acid mutations: E484K, D614G, and V1176F, all of which are found in the virus's spike protein code.[6] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, F565L has been detected in some of the Zeta variant sequences, but not all.[7] Amino acid mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Zeta variant plotted on a genome map of SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on the spike.[6]  This article about the COVID-19 pandemic is a stub.
