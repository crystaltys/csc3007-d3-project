{"Content: ":"Psychedelic film Psychedelic pop (or acid pop[3]) is pop music that contains musical characteristics associated with psychedelic music.[1] Developing in the late 1960s, elements included \"trippy\" features such as fuzz guitars, tape manipulation, backwards recording, sitars, and Beach Boys-style harmonies, wedded to melodic songs with tight song structures.[1] The style lasted into the early 1970s.[1] It has seen revivals in subsequent decades by neo-psychedelic artists.[2] According to AllMusic, psychedelic pop was not too \"freaky\", but also not very \"bubblegum\" either.[1] It appropriated the effects associated with straight psychedelic music, applying their innovations to concise pop songs.[1] The music was occasionally confined to the studio, but there existed more organic exceptions whose psychedelia was bright and melodic.[1] AllMusic adds: \"What's [strange] is that some psychedelic pop is more interesting than average psychedelia, since it had weird, occasionally awkward blends of psychedelia and pop conventions -- the Neon Philharmonic's 1969 album The Moth Confesses is a prime example of this.\"[1] 1966 1967 1968 By the end of the 1960s, psychedelic folk and rock were in retreat. Many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into either more back-to-basics \"roots rock\", traditional-based, pastoral or whimsical folk, the wider experimentation of progressive rock, or riff-laden heavy rock.[12][verification needed] Psychedelic influences lasted a little longer in pop music, stretching into the early 1970s.[1] Psychedelic pop became a component of the neo-psychedelic style. There were occasional mainstream acts that dabbled in the genre, including Prince's mid-1980s work and some of Lenny Kravitz's 1990s output, but it has mainly been the domain of alternative and indie rock bands.[2]","Title":"Psychedelic pop - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3215","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_pop"}
