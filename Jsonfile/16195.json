The channel - via RFE/RL - is funded through grants from the US Congress through the US Agency for Global Media.[1] Representatives of the US government, including the head of the Governing Council on Broadcasting, are prohibited from interfering in the work of the channel's journalists.[citation needed] The media sees its task in \"promoting democratic values and institutions\". RFE/RL launched Current Time, in October 2014.[2] The official round-the-clock broadcasting began on February 7, 2017.[3][4][5] Current Time was instituted as an alternative to Kremlin-controlled media and Russian propaganda.[6][7] Despite the fact that Current Time was intended to counterbalance Russian official news coverage, Kenan Aliyev,[8] executive editor of Current Time, told Reuters that C.T. was not counterpropaganda at all.[9] Current Time is available on cable, satellite and digital platforms in Russia, the Baltics, Ukraine, the Caucasus, and central Asia.[9] It had over 1,500,000 followers on Facebook and 1,300,000 subscribers on YouTube in August 2020.[5] On 27 February 2022, Roskomnadzor blocked the website of the channel for its coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[10]","Title":"Current Time TV - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16195","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Time_TV"}
