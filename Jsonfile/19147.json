He resigned as UUP leader in November 2019. Swann stood as the UUP candidate in North Antrim in the December 2019 general election, which saw their vote more than double to 18.5%, taking the party to second place in the constituency. In 2020, he was appointed Minister of Health and has since been leading the response of the Northern Ireland Executive to the COVID-19 Pandemic.[citation needed] Elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 7 May 2011, he successfully defended his seat in the 2016 Assembly election and at the snap election in March 2017, where he was the first unionist elected in North Antrim.[3] During the short 2016 Assembly mandate he was Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee[citation needed] which commenced the Inquiry into the RHI scandal.

He has chaired the YFCU's National Executive and Rural Affairs Committees and has been Chairman of the Rural Youth Europe organisation.[4] In the 2022 election Swann went on to top the North Antrim poll.
