The university was officially opened on 20 April 1954 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The University of Peradeniya hosts nine faculties (including the newly added Management faculty), three postgraduate institutes, 10 centres, 73 departments, and teaches about 12,000 students in the fields of Medicine, Agriculture, Arts, Science, Engineering, Dental Sciences, Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Management and Allied Health Science.[3] It claims to have the largest government endowment by a higher education institution in Sri Lanka, based on its large staff and faculties/departments.[1] The University of Peradeniya site touches the natural environment of the lower slopes of the Hanthana mountain range.[citation needed] The university is in the Central Province, 8 km from the sacred city of Kandy (the historic capital of the last kingdom of Sri Lanka) and about 110 km from Colombo. The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya is close by. The university spans nearly 700 hectares in the Mahaweli flood plain. Most of the area remains afforested. The climate around the university is mild, and the temperature fluctuates between 18 and 30 degrees Celsius. The main entrance to the university is through Galaha road. The Faculty of Engineering is on one side of the Mahaweli River and all other faculties are on the other side. The Akbar bridge links the two banks of the river. Considered as a marvel of civil engineering, it was designed by A. Thurairajah (Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, 1975\u201377 and 1982\u201385), and built by the first batch of the faculty, in the year of its inception. The Sarasavi Uyana railway station is on campus. Another bridge known as Yaka Paalama links the railway to the other bank. Daily shuttle bus services operate from Kandy to Galaha junction and Kandy to the university. A separate subcampus was established in 1968 at Mahailuppallama, North Central province for the Faculty of Agriculture.[4] Separate residential facilities are provided to this subcampus. The proposal for the establishment of University of Ceylon, the first university of Sri Lanka (the predecessor of University of Peradeniya) goes back to 1899.[3] But no progress was seen until the formation of Ceylon University Association in 1906 under the guidance of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, Sir James Peiris and Sir Marcus Fernando. Its request for a European-style university in Sri Lanka was partially granted by the British rulers with the formation of Ceylon University College on 1 January 1921. The University Council, through which the administration of the Ceylon University College was done, appointed committees to plan the academic activities of a future university.[3] It made suggestions to build the university in Bullers Road (now Bauddhaloka Mawatha) in Colombo, but it was disputed by politicians. To resolve the conflict, the then Governor Hugh Clifford appointed a committee headed by Justice M.T. Akbar on 20 December 1926. It suggested that the proposed university should be unitary, residential and outside Colombo. Another committee was appointed in 1928 with Sir Walter Buchanan-Riddel as chairman. It proposed a site at Aruppola, in the Dumbara Valley close to Kandy. Dr. S.C. Paul and Andreas Nell pointed out disadvantages in the site and proposed a larger one at Peradeniya. In 1938 the government acquired the plot and developed an area about 150 hectares (out of 700 hectares) to create the University Park.[5] Although the site was acquired, no plans were made to establish the university until 1941. With the arrival of Sir Ivor Jennings, as the second principal of the Ceylon University College, establishment plans were put into effect. He stressed the urgent need to move the university to Peradeniya to the Minister of Education C. W. W. Kannangara and took the initiative in the process. Thus he is considered the forefather of the University of Peradeniya.[6] In 1942, the University of Ceylon was created as the first unitary, residential and autonomous university in Sri Lanka with its seat in Peradeniya, amalgamating Ceylon University College and the Medical College into a single unit with 55 academic staff members, 904 students in four faculties.[7][8] But due to World War II, the construction of buildings started in 1946. Until then, the lectures and laboratory classes were conducted in the buildings obtained from the Ceylon University College and the Ceylon Medical College in Colombo. Consultants Sir Patrick Abercrombie and Clifford Holliday did the planning and layout of the university complex. The first phase of work constituted only the development of the left bank. The building of a bridge across the Mahaweli River, later known as the 'Akbar bridge', was planned by Prof. A Thurairajah. Transfer of the first batch of students, students from the Departments of Law and Agriculture and the third and fourth year students of the Department of Veterinary Science, from Colombo to Peradeniya took place in 1949. Another major move took place in 1952, with the transfer of staff and students of the Faculties of Arts and Oriental Studies, together with the Main Library and the University Administration. This movement on 6 October 1952 marks the official establishment of University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. At the initial stages, vice chancellor Jennings wanted to model British universities, but met with the resistance of students who opposed the changes.[9] Although the buildings at Peradeniya were established in 1952, the official ceremony for its inception was held on 20 April 1954, with the participation of Queen Elizabeth II. The Sri Lankan government was keen to postpone the ceremony until Queen Elizabeth II could participate. Her visit was delayed by the death of King George VI. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh also participated in the event. He declared the university opened: You have remarked Mr. Chancellor, that it is not easy to open a university, because once established it is always open. However, like the shopkeepers of London during the bombing, I can declare this place to be \"more open than usual...\" Sections of the University of Ceylon, functioned in Colombo and Peradeniya acted as campuses of the same university until 1967. In 1967, these campuses were split into two. The section in Peradeniya was known as the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, while the section in Colombo was known as University of Ceylon, Colombo. By the University Act No. 1 of 1972, four[citation needed] universities functioned a \u2014 Peradeniya, Colombo, Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara and the Ceylon College of Technology, Katubedda, Moratuwa became five constituent campuses of a single structure \u2013 the University of Sri Lanka. It had one vice chancellor and five presidents for five campuses. Under this designation, University of Ceylon \u2013 Peradeniya became the University of Sri Lanka \u2013 Peradeniya Campus. This designation prevailed until 1978. Under the Universities Act No. 16, 1978, the University of Sri Lanka was split into six independent, autonomous institutions as University of Peradeniya, University of Colombo, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, University of Kelaniya, University of Moratuwa and University of Jaffna.[10] This Act brought back some of the central features of the Ceylon University Ordinance of 1942 such as the senates, the councils and courts. The University of Peradeniya operates under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985. It is a state university and the undergraduate study is 100% free. Therefore, it depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. The administration is based upon that of the former University of Ceylon consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the council (formally known as the University Court which is the governing body) and the Academic Senate (academic affairs). The chancellor is the head of the university and is responsible for awarding all the academic degrees. Usually the chancellor is a distinguished person in an academic discipline. Otherwise it is a member of the clergy or a distinguished person from civil society. The President of Sri Lanka appoints the chancellor. The position is mainly ceremonial and duties are usually carried out by the vice chancellor. The current chancellor of the university is Prof. K M de Silva. The vice chancellor is the de facto principal academic and administrative officer of the university, responsible for management tasks. This appointment is also done by the President of Sri Lanka. The current vice chancellor is Prof. M.D. Lamawansa, who is also the Professor of Surgery. The deputy vice-chancellor is Prof. W.M.Terrance Madhujith, Professor of Food Science. Deans are the heads of the faculties. They are responsible for the management and the tasks carried out by the faculty. Deans are appointed by the chancellor for three years.   The university has eight academic faculties of study. These faculties contain 72 departments. In addition, the university has two postgraduate institutions and six affiliated centres. At the beginning, it had only three present-day faculties \u2014 the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Science. Departments of Law and Oriental Studies functioned separately. Since then, five other faculties have been added. The latest addition is the Faculty of Allied Health Science, established in 2005. The Post-graduate Institute of Science (PGIS) and Post-graduate Institute of Agriculture (PGIA) are the institutions established in the university. PGIS is a national institute established by the Ministry of Higher Education, Sri Lanka in 1996. PGIA was established in 1975 and offers three postgraduate degrees. PGIA offers postgraduate level courses in Agricultural disciplines. In addition to these institutions, Senerath Paranavitana Teaching and Research Museum functions affiliated to the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Arts.[11] It was established in 1960. In 2020 Times Higher Education World University Rankings has placed the University of Peradeniya first in Sri Lanka and 401\u2013500 band in world university ranking. This is the highest world ranking that any university in Sri Lanka has reached in the recent history. The University of Peradeniya has also been ranked first in Sri Lanka under other popular university rankings schemes such as webometric, QS and QS regional rankings in 2019\u20132020. In 2019\u20132020, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), University of Peradeniya ranked first in Sri Lanka and 1123rd in the world. University of Peradeniya was ranked No. 1 in Sri Lanka based on total ResearchGate scores. The library is a centrally administered network of libraries. It is considered the oldest academic library in Sri Lanka.[d] Containing over 430,000 items, it is one of the largest libraries serving the country. Seven branches are in faculties in the main campus at Peradeniya and one other branch in Mahailuppallama subcampus. University of Peradeniya library contains a legal deposit collection of 300,000 items, special collection of 15,000+ items acquired from various individuals, palm-leaf manuscript collection of approximately 5,000 (second largest in Sri Lanka) and a microfilm collection of 17,000. Furthermore, it owns the largest historical map collection in Sri Lanka.[12] Students at the University of Peradeniya run over 100 clubs and organizations. These include cultural and religious groups, academic clubs, and common-interest organizations. The Peradeniya Students' Union (PSU) is considered the highest body which represents all internal students.[13] Separate student unions operate in each faculty. These student societies include: Agriculture Faculty Forestry Society   Sports activities are conducted by the Department of Physical Education. University of Peradeniya has 30 athletics teams to date. Facilities include a well-equipped gymnasium, one of the largest multi-purpose outstation stadiums in Sri Lanka, a 50m swimming pool and separate stadiums for cricket, rugby, football, hockey, tennis, track and field, and elle. The University of Peradeniya is the only residential university in Sri Lanka. It provides residential facilities to most of its undergraduate students, all its academic staff members and guests. Three guest houses \u2014 Gal Bangalawa, Upper Hantana Guest House and Lady Hill was a tourist hotel \u2013 come under university administration. Residential halls for undergraduate students: The university has developed international relationships since its earliest days. Student exchange programs (Erasmus and International Credit Mobility Programme with SLU, Sweden), collaborative research, split postgraduate programs, international seminars, conferences and short courses are being carried out with these global partners by the Directorate of Research and International Affairs. This was established as a separate institution in 2006.[14] UoP has initiated cooperation programs with foreign governments and institutions. UoP is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) academic network. The university has signed Memorandums of Understanding for research and academic development with these international universities.[15] The Intercollegiate Sri Lanka Education (ISLE) program provides facilities for undergraduate students from United States of America to study in Sri Lanka. Each year, about 20 undergraduates spend five months in Sri Lanka following courses given by members of the Faculty of Arts. This programme also involves an exchange of faculty.[20][21] Total number of undergraduates in the university for year 2009\u20132010 was 9605. Student intake for that year remained 2620. In 2008, 1514 postgraduate students studied in the university, most of them affiliated to the two postgraduate institutions: Postgraduate Institute of Science (PGIS) and Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture (PGIA). Postgraduate output for the year was 358, including 15 doctorates. Faculties except Science and Agriculture conducted their own postgraduate courses. Women constituted 53.15 percent of undergraduates. Women constitution remained over 45 percent in all faculties except Faculty of Engineering where it was 15.46 percent.[f] Courses in all faculties except Faculty of Arts are taught in English medium. In the Faculty of Arts 69.85 percent undergraduates are enrolled in Sinhala, 15.93 percent in Tamil and 14.22 percent in English. University of Peradeniya has produced a large number of alumni.
