He was elected.[3] However, Sivamaharajah and all other EROS MPs boycotted Parliament because of their opposition to the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka which required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state.[4] After three months of absence, Sivamaharajah forfeited his seat in Parliament on 12 June 1989.[4][5] Sivamaharajah did however enter Parliament on 17 July 1989, replacing S.
