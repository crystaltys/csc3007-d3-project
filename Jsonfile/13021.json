The classified hotels collectively have a capacity of 14,232 rooms and include 25 five-star hotels and 24 four-star hotels.[1] SLTDA's grading is based on the criteria set by the World Tourism Organization. In 2011, the classified hotels accounted for 70% of the total room capacity in the industry.[2] A number of accommodation facilities that built during the British colonial era have been converted to high-class hotels later. These include the Galle Face Hotel, the Grand Oriental Hotel, the Mount Lavinia Hotel, the Queen's Hotel, Kandy, the Grand Hotel and St. Andrew's Hotel and the New Oriental Hotel.[3]                            ","Title":"List of hotels in Sri Lanka - Wikipedia","KeyID":"13021","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hotels_in_Sri_Lanka"}
