{"Content: ":"Bornheim is a quarter of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It is part of the Ortsbezirk Bornheim/Ostend. In the past, Bornheim was called Das lustige Dorf (\"The merry village\"), because it was the red-light district of Frankfurt up to some 120 years ago. It still retains some of its lively charm and is said to be the younger crowd's hangout, shared with Sachsenhausen. The main street of Bornheim is Berger Stra√üe, a cosmopolitan boulevard with many bars, pubs and restaurants and two of Frankfurt's most traditional cider houses, Solzer and Zur Sonne. The Holy Cross Church with the Holy Cross - Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg, known for its modernist architecture, is located in Bornheim. Two underground lines (U4 and U7) run through Bornheim.  This Hesse location article is a stub.
