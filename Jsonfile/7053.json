{"Content: ":"Lothar Gall (born 3 December 1936 in Lötzen, East Prussia, present day Poland) is a German historian known as \"one of German liberalism's primary historians\".[1] He was professor of history at Goethe University Frankfurt from 1975 until his retirement in 2005. Gall's doctoral thesis examined the political thought of Benjamin Constant, and its influence in Vormärz Germany. His next book was a regional study of liberalism in Baden between 1848 and 1871. This informed an influential 1975 article about the effects of the 1848 revolution upon German liberalism:[2] Gall argued that the revolution transformed liberalism from a constitutional movement committed to a classless society of burghers to an economically bourgeois ideology committed to free-market capitalism.[3] His biography of Otto von Bismarck has been translated into English.","Title":"Lothar Gall - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7053","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Gall"}
