{"Content: ":"Niall James Horan (/ˈnaɪəl ˈhɒrən/;[1] born 13 September 1993) is an Irish singer and songwriter. He rose to prominence as a member of the English-Irish boy band One Direction, formed in 2010 on the British singing competition The X Factor. The group released five albums and went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Following the band's hiatus in 2016, Horan signed a recording deal as a solo artist with Capitol Records. Horan's debut solo album, Flicker (2017), debuted at number one in Ireland and the US, and reached the top three in Australia and the UK. The album's first two singles, \"This Town\" and \"Slow Hands\", reached the top twenty in several countries. Horan's second studio album, Heartbreak Weather, was released in March 2020 and debuted at number one in the UK, Ireland and Mexico, and at number four in the US.[2] Horan was born on 13 September 1993 in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland.[3] He has an older brother, Greg.[4] His parents, Bobby Horan and Maura Gallagher, divorced when he was five years old, so he and his brother lived with their mother for a year. After spending a year apart from their father, they later decided to move in with him.[5] He had asthma as a child.[6] He attended St. Kenny's National School, a primary school, and Mary's College (Irish: Coláiste Mhuire), a Catholic boys school, which are both located in his hometown of Mullingar. Horan tried to play the guitar that his brother bought for his marriage, but was not able to play it. Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his abilities one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing, and she had initially thought that the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks. He was also bagging a support slot with former X Factor contestant Lloyd Daniels at the Academy club in Dublin.[7] In 2010, at sixteen years old, Horan auditioned for the seventh series of The X Factor in Dublin.[8] He sang \"So Sick\" and received mixed comments from the judges. Louis Walsh was in his favour, but Cheryl Cole and guest judge Katy Perry felt that he needed some time to grow. Simon Cowell voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes. Horan was then put through to bootcamp. At bootcamp, he sang \"Champagne Supernova\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge Nicole Scherzinger, Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer Peter Dickson read their name out on the live shows. The group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"Torn\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as Kelly Clarkson's \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" and Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up Rebecca Ferguson and winner Matt Cardle. Following The X Factor, One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million Syco record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was released and topped The Sunday Times' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in The X Factor Live Tour. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub. One Direction's debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful\", was released in September 2011. A global and commercial success, the song reached number one in several countries.[9][10][11][12] Subsequent singles, \"Gotta Be You\", \"One Thing\", and \"More than This\", had also received success,[13][14][15] with the first two becoming top ten hits in the UK. In November of that year, the group's debut album \"Up All Night\" was released in Ireland and the UK, reaching number one and number two on the charts, respectively. The album was released internationally in March 2012, and One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.[16] To promote the album, they embarked on their first headlining concert tour, the Up All Night Tour. Originally intended with shows taking place only in Europe, additional dates in North America and Australia were added due to extreme demand. The tour was a commercial success; tickets sold out in minutes, and the tour was met with positive reviews from critics who applauded their singing abilities and stage presence.[17] In May 2012, the band released the tour's DVD, Up All Night: The Live Tour.[18][19] That same month, One Direction's first book to be licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, was published and topped The New York Times Best Seller list.[20] In September 2012, the group released \"Live While We're Young\", the lead single from their upcoming second album.
