It has also been instrumental in launching the IMMIES music awards in collaboration with MTV. The Indian music industry is largely dominated by Indian film soundtracks, which account for nearly 80% of the country's music revenue, followed by Indi-pop.[1][2] As of 2014, the largest Indian music record label is T-Series with up to 35% share of the Indian market, followed by Sony Music India (the largest foreign-owned label) with up to 25% share, and then Zee Music (which has a partnership with Sony).[3] As of 2017, 216 million Indians use music streaming services such as YouTube, Hungama, Gaana and Saavn.[4] T-Series has the world's most-subscribed and most-viewed YouTube channel. The industry was dominated by cassette tapes in the 1980s and 1990s.[1] In 1990, India had annual cassette sales of 180 million units, including both legitimate and pirate sales. This made it the world's second largest cassette market, after the United States.[5] By 1998, the industry had annual earnings of \u20b912 billion[6] ($291 million).[7] In the early 2000s, 49 million cassettes (including 16 million pirate tapes) were sold every month.[8] Later in the 2000s, the industry transitioned to online streaming, bypassing CD and digital downloads.[1] The Indian Music Industry has constituted different, awards to encourage and promote music.

The data is collected and aggregated by BMAT Music Innovators and chart is reviewed by IMI Charts committee.[9][10] The first number-one song for the chart dated 21 June 2021, was \"Butter\" by BTS.[11] India has separate scales for music recording certifications. Certifications are usually based on sales, like some other Asian countries. Like many other Asian countries, domestic repertoire accounts for the majority of the Indian music market.
