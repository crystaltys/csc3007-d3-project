He later served as Prime Minister of Peru from 2000 to 2001. Pérez de Cuéllar was a member of the Club of Madrid, a group of former heads of state and government,[2] and the Inter-American Dialogue.[3] Javier Pérez de Cuéllar was born on 19 January 1920 in Lima, Peru,[4] to a wealthy family of Spanish descent with ancestry from Cuéllar.[5][6] He studied at Colegio San Agustín, and then at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.[7] Pérez de Cuéllar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1940 and the diplomatic service in 1944, serving thereafter as secretary at Peru's embassy in France,[8] where he met and married his first wife, Yvette Roberts-Darricau (1922\u20132013), in 1947.[9][10] He also held posts in Britain, Bolivia and Brazil,[5] and later served as ambassador to Switzerland from 1964 to 1966, the Soviet Union and Poland from 1969 to 1971, and Venezuela from 1977 to 1979.[11] From his first marriage, he had a son, Francisco, and a daughter, Águeda Cristina.[5] He was a member of the Peruvian delegation to the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, which convened in London in 1946,[5] and of the delegations to the 25th through 30th sessions of the Assembly.[8] In 1971, he was appointed permanent representative of Peru to the UN and led his country's delegation in the Assembly until 1975.[5] In 1973 and 1974, he represented Peru in the UN Security Council, serving as its president at the time of the Cypriot coup d'état in July 1974.[8] On 18 September 1975, he was appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Cyprus \u2013 a post he held until December 1977, when he rejoined Peru's foreign service.[8] Also in 1975, Pérez de Cuéllar divorced his first wife and married Marcela Temple Seminario (1933\u20132013),[9][12] with whom he had no children.[13] On 27 February 1979, he was appointed UN under-secretary-general for Special Political Affairs. From April 1981, he also acted as the Secretary-General's personal representative on the situation in Afghanistan; he visited Pakistan and Afghanistan in April and August of that year to continue negotiations initiated by the Secretary-General some months earlier.[8] In December 1981, Pérez de Cuéllar was selected to succeed Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General of the United Nations;[14] he was unanimously re-elected for a second term in October 1986.[15] During his two terms as secretary-general, he led mediations between the United Kingdom and Argentina in the aftermath of the Falklands War[12] and promoted the efforts of the Contadora group to bring peace and stability to Central America.[16] He also interceded in the negotiations for the independence of Namibia,[5] the conflict in Western Sahara,[17] the war between Croatian forces seeking independence and the Yugoslav People's Army (as well as the local Serb forces),[18] and the Cyprus issue.[19] In 1986 he presided over an international arbitration committee that ruled on the Rainbow Warrior incident between New Zealand and France.[20] In 1983, he initiated the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in order to unite countries to pursue sustainable development.[21] During the build-up to the Gulf War, he convinced US president George H. W. Bush to send secretary of state James Baker to negotiate with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva.[22] Shortly before the end of his second term, he rejected an unofficial request by members of the Security Council to reconsider his earlier decision not to run for a third term, shortened to two years, as a search for his successor had not, as of then, yielded a consensus candidate.[citation needed] A suitable candidate, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, was agreed upon in November 1991,[23] and Pérez de Cuéllar's second term as secretary-general concluded, as scheduled, on 31 December 1991.[5] Pérez de Cuéllar ran unsuccessfully against Alberto Fujimori for president of Peru in 1995; following Fujimori's resignation over corruption charges, he served as prime minister and foreign minister[5] from November 2000 until July 2001.[7] After Alejandro Toledo's election as president in 2001,[13] he went to Paris as Peru's ambassador to France, retiring in 2004.[7] In 1997, Pérez de Cuéllar published his memoir Pilgrimage for Peace in which he recounted his years at the UN.[5] Having celebrated his 100th birthday in January,[24] Pérez de Cuéllar died at his home in Lima on 4 March 2020.[25][5] He received several honorary degrees from universities such as the following:","Title":"Javier Pérez de Cuéllar - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9627","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_P%C3%A9rez_de_Cu%C3%A9llar"}
