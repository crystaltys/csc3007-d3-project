Other research interests include medical ethics and the prevention of disease in older people. Macintyre has more than 380 peer-reviewed publications, and contributes to expert committees and editorial boards. After completing her PhD under Aileen Plant, MacIntyre was awarded a Harkness Fellowship to Johns Hopkins University, recognised as \"the gold standard ... for public health research\".[7] In Australia, MacIntyre became \"a familiar face on television and radio\" during the Covid-19 pandemic, her epidemiological commentary \"calmly delivered from her bedroom, where she continues her research almost around the clock\".[7] MacIntyre has been a regular commentator and contributor to Covid epidemiology, in The Guardian,[9] The Sydney Morning Herald,[3][10] as well as ABC News[11] and Q+A.[12] In a lunch interview with The Sydney Morning Herald she was described as a 'globally renowned\" and \"the cautious coronavirus communicator\".[7] MacIntyre has been interviewed extensively for her expertise during the pandemic in Australia, including an interview on booster jabs, by Norman Swan from the ABC,[13] and about vaccination roll-outs across different states.[14] She is recognised as one the \"most recognisable faces whom the Australian media has designated an expert during COVID-19\".[15] Her modelling, from the Kirby Institute, has been used to determine whether states will re-open or not.[16] MacIntyre's portrait was painted for the 2021 Archibald Prize by artist Karen Black. Due to the frequent media appearances, she caught Black's fancy and the artist \"set her heart on painting the professor for the Archibald Prize\".[17] \"How she explained the scientific facts around aspects of the virus was easy to comprehend,\" Karen Black commented.[17]","Title":"Raina MacIntyre - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9750","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raina_MacIntyre"}
