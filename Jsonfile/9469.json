{"Content: ":"The United Nations Art Collection is a collective group of artworks and historic objects donated as gifts to the United Nations by its member states, associations, or individuals. These artistic treasures and possessions, mostly in the form of \u201csculptures, paintings, tapestries and mosaics\u201d, are representative \u201carts of nations\u201d that are contained and exhibited within the confines of the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, United States, and other duty stations, making the UN and its international territories a \"fine small museum\".[1][2] Member states follow a protocol for presenting official gifts to the United Nations. Procedures, speeches, and ceremonies, such as the unveiling of these gifts, are conducted and coordinated by the Protocol and Liaison Service. Ideally, every member nation can only present one offering, and member nations are responsible for the installation of the offered artifacts.[2][3][4] The official gifts to the United Nations by its member states epitomize the ideals, significance and values of the UN as an international organization.[5] Dove of Peace, presented by Pope John Paul II, on the occasion of his visit to the United Nations, 2 October 1979 The Japanese Peace Bell, 1954 Let Us Beat Swords into Plowshares by Yevgeny Vuchetich, 1959.
