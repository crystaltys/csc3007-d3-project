{"Content: ":"Alexander William Roberton (Edinburgh, 1942 \u2013 27 July 2022),[1] better known as Sandy Roberton, was a British record producer and music business owner. Roberton was born in Edinburgh, Scotland[2] and raised in Kenya, where he was in a local beat group, Les Ombres. In the mid-1960s, he moved to London and was one half of a duo, Rick and Sandy, who recorded several singles for the Mercury and Decca labels. Roberton moved into production and produced singles by the Chocolate Watch Band (an English band featuring Gary Osborne, not the U.S. band of a similar name). He ran Chess Records' publishing companies Arc Music, Regent Music and Jewel Music, and also Lowery Music. He left to form the publishing companies for Mike Vernon's Blue Horizon Records.[3] Roberton then formed his own company, September Productions, and worked with such artists as The Liverpool Scene, Iain Matthews, Shelagh McDonald, Andy Roberts, Decameron, Keith Christmas, Harold McNair, Marc Ellington, Shirley Collins, Plainsong, John Martyn and Steeleye Span, as well as producing the first three Steeleye Span albums, Hark! The Village Wait (1970), Please to See the King (1971) and Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again (1971). Roberton subsequently moved into management with Decameron and Gay and Terry Woods. He formed Rockburgh Records, releasing records by Gay and Terry Woods, Ian Matthews, and Allan Taylor, among others, and returning to production duties.[3] Roberton founded the Worlds End Producer Management Company and publishing company in 1980, moving its base to Los Angeles in 1985, when he became its sole owner. The company became a leading management company in this field, with over 75 producers during the 1990s and early 2000s. The company continues to exist as of 2021, and has a sister label, Beverly Martel.[4]  This article on a record producer is a stub.
