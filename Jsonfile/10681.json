{"Content: ":"The following has been the Provincial governmental response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. On March 15, 2020, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) ordered the closure of all provincial casinos.[1] On March 17, 2020, Premier Ford declared a provincial state of emergency, prohibiting public gatherings larger than 50 people, and ordering the closure of all schools, child care services, libraries, indoor recreation facilities, dine-in bars and restaurants, and all cinemas, theatres, and concert venues. Ford stated the \"vast majority\" of businesses were not affected by the order, promising that \"essential services and essential needs will be available to every individual and families.[2] On March 20, 2020, further measures were announced, including waiving the three-month waiting period for Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage,[3] the launch of an e-learning portal,[4] and extended privileges for hospitals to re-deploy staff.[5] On March 23, 2020, Ford ordered all \"non-essential\" businesses closed by 11:59 p.m.[6] A list of 74 \"essential\" businesses was published later in the day.[7][8][9] On March 27, 2020, at 2:00 p.m. ET, Alert Ready was activated on all radio stations, television broadcasters and LTE wireless networks in Ontario, broadcasting an emergency alert warning those returning from international travel of their obligation to self-isolate for 14 days under the Quarantine Act.[10] On March 30, 2020, the Ontario government extended the state of emergency through April 13, 2020, and also ordered the province-wide closure of all outdoor recreational amenities, including beaches, playgrounds and sports facilities (several Ontario municipalities including Toronto, had already ordered similar closures of their recreational amenities several days prior to the province-wide order).[11] On April 3, 2020, it was announced the number of \"essential\" businesses would be reduced to 44 beginning 11:59 p.m. on April 4, 2020; this included Ontario Cannabis Store and the halting of most non-essential construction, including industrial construction, and residential construction that did not begin before April 4, 2020, but excluding \"critical\" infrastructure projects.[12][13][14] On May 27, 2020, all existing public health orders were extended through June 9, 2020.[15] On April 27, 2020, Premier Ford released \"A Framework for Reopening our Province\", a roadmap detailing a \"gradual\" lifting of economic restrictions. The process was divided into three stages, with the first intending to allow reopening outdoor spaces, businesses that can \"immediately meet or modify operations\" to allow a larger number of participants in certain types of gatherings and allow the resumption of some non-elective medical procedures. Stage 2 would allow additional businesses and outdoor spaces to reopen, and increase the limit on participants in gatherings. Stage 3 would contain further relaxation of prior restrictions, although restrictions on large public gatherings will remain in place indefinitely.[16] After the process began in mid-May, the entirety of the province reached Stage 3 in mid-August.[17] On June 12, Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams issued guidelines for \"social circles\" \u2014 allowance for families to expand their interactions with up to 10 people (including themselves) from outside of their immediate household.[18] On September 17, in response to a surge in new cases in parts of the province, it was announced that the maximum size of \"unmonitored social gatherings and organized public events\" in the Ottawa, Peel, and Toronto regions would be reduced from 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors, to 10 indoors and 25 outdoors. Organizers of events that violate this restriction can be fined a minimum of $10,000, on top of the existing $750 fine for violating Ontario public health orders. Ford stated that the rule was primarily intended to target events occurring in parks and private locations, and that staffed facilities not targeted under the rule (such as banquet halls, cinemas, convention centres, and restaurants) have employed safety protocols compliant with the province's health guidance.[19] On September 19, the aforementioned restrictions on private gatherings were extended province-wide.[20] On September 25, it was announced that effective September 26 province-wide, strip clubs would be ordered closed, and that all bars, restaurants and nightclubs would be required to end the sale of alcoholic beverages at 11:00 p.m. and close their dining rooms between midnight and 5:00 a.m. nightly.[21] On October 2, Premier Ford announced that the wearing of face masks would become mandatory province-wide in all public spaces and workplaces when social distancing is not possible, effective October 3. A number of health regions had already implemented similar mandates at the regional level.[22] In addition, new restrictions were introduced in the Ottawa, Peel, and Toronto regions; bars and restaurants must collect contact information from all patrons for contact tracing purposes, and are capped at a capacity of 100 people and six patrons per table. Event facilities were capped at a capacity of 50 people total (rather than 50 per room) and also subject to the six-person cap. Gyms are also capped at 50 patrons, and exercise classes were capped at 10.[22] Due to heightened cases in the regions, Peel, Ottawa, and Toronto were rolled back to Modified Stage 2 from October 10 to November 7, reinstating closures of indoor dining areas, casinos, cinemas and theatres, gyms, and personal care services that require the removal of face masks. All gatherings are capped at 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors, and team sports are restricted to practices only, with scrimmages and games prohibited. Wedding receptions were also prohibited following the Thanksgiving long weekend. Schools and places of worship will continue operations.[23][24] On October 16, it was announced that York Region would also be placed under Modified Stage 2 beginning October 19.[25] On November 25, a report was released by Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk which found that Ontario's initial response to COVID-19 was \"slower and more reactive relative to most other provinces and many other international jurisdictions\" (in contrast to its response to the SARS outbreak). The report found that Public Health Ontario had a \"diminished role\" in the response, including the province's Central Co-ordination Table for COVID-19 consisting largely of deputy ministers rather than public health officials such as Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams (who acted primarily on the advice of Ontario's Health Command Table), and ignoring recommendations made by public health officials.[26][27] On May 14, 2020, it was announced that Stage 1 of Ontario's lifting of restrictions would begin May 20, focusing primarily on \"workplaces that are well-positioned to follow public health advice to maintain physical distancing, implement workplace safety guidance and limit gatherings\". Certain outdoor recreation activities that are part of Stage 1 were allowed to resume on May 16, for the Victoria Day long weekend.[28] On June 8, it was announced that Stage 2 would be implemented across most of the province, excluding 10 Southern Ontario health regions primarily in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and along the Canada\u2013United States border (such as Windsor-Essex County) due to a large number of active cases.[29] In addition, Ford announced that the cap on gathering sizes would be increased to ten province-wide regardless of phase, and that there would be a moratorium on evictions through the end of August of small businesses which are eligible for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program.[30][29] On June 15, the Durham, Halton, Haldimand-Norfolk, Hamilton, Lambton, Niagara, and York health regions were allowed to enter Stage 2.[31] On June 22, it was announced that Peel and Toronto would be allowed to enter Stage 2 on June 24. Windsor-Essex was still excluded from Stage 2 due to outbreaks involving the agriculture industry.[32] On June 24, it was announced that most of Windsor-Essex would be allowed to enter Stage 2 on June 25, excluding Kingsville and Leamington.[33] On July 3, Premier Ford stated that he did not have a specific timetable for Stage 3; \"You see what's happening [in the United States] when you move too quickly, you see what's happening south of the border. We don't want that happening up here.\"[34] By August 12, after a region-by-region roll-out, all regions in Ontario had entered Stage 3.[17] On September 8, in response to growing case numbers, the provincial government announced a moratorium on further lifting of restrictions (such as expansion of \"social circles\" and gatherings) for at least four weeks, besides those already ongoing (such as schools, and reopening of selected casinos on September 26).[35] Industry/retail Outdoor recreation Care/household Services Stage 2 allowed certain businesses to reopen, with heavy restrictions: On December 21, 2020, Premier Ford announced that in order to \"save lives and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed in the coming weeks\", a \"strict\" province-wide shutdown would begin in all health regions (regardless of their current status on the response framework) at 12:01 a.m. ET on December 26, 2020 (Boxing Day). This measure will last for 28 days.[39][40] It was originally to last only 14 days in the northern regions of the province (north of Sudbury), but on January 7, 2021, it was announced that the province-wide shutdown will be extended in these regions to the same length as in Southern Ontario.[41] Indoor social gatherings that involve people from outside of one's immediate household are prohibited. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people with social distancing. All non-essential businesses, retail outlets (which include all businesses deemed non-essential under the \"Lockdown\" tier of the response framework, as well as hardware stores and pet shops), cultural amenities, sports and recreation facilities (unless \"being used by high-performance athletes and specified professional leagues\"), and personal care services must close to the public. Essential retail businesses are subject to capacity limits stricter than those used under Lockdown (50% for supermarkets and pharmacies, 25% for liquor stores and allowable big-box stores that sell groceries). Bars and restaurants are prohibited from offering dine-in service. All drive-in or drive-through events are prohibited, excluding drive-in religious services.[41][39] All publicly-funded schools remained closed to in-person classes (resuming remotely after the holiday break) until January 11, 2021, in Northern Ontario, and January 25, 2021, in Southern Ontario.[42] Elementary schools were originally slated to reopen in Southern Ontario on January 11, but on January 7, it was announced that this would be delayed.[42] On January 12, 2021, citing models forecasting that Ontario's health care system will be \"overwhelmed\" with cases and mortality exceeding those of the first wave unless actions are taken,[43] Premier Ford declared a second provincial state of emergency and announced stricter province-wide measures, to take effect on January 14 at 12:01 a.m. ET and last through at least February 11. These measures upgraded the province-wide shutdown to a stay-at-home order; all Ontario residents were required to remain at their homes unless conducting an activity deemed essential. Essential activities include shopping at grocery stores or pharmacies, receiving health care, exercise, or conducing essential work that cannot be performed remotely.[44][43] Remote work was mandated where possible.[44][43] The province states that what is considered \"essential work\" is based on \"[the] best judgement and common sense of employers\".[45] Performing arts facilities were required to cease all operations, even for virtual streaming concerts.[46] All other restrictions enacted under the province-wide shutdown remained in force, and the colour-coded response framework was officially considered \"paused\" due to the declaration of emergency.[45][47] Certain businesses, such as liquor stores, hardware stores, and stores offering delivery or curbside pickup services, were required to close from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. nightly. Non-essential construction activity was also suspended. Outdoor gatherings were limited to five people, and guidance now recommends masks be worn outside (in addition to the existing indoor mandate) if social distancing is not possible.[44][43] The closure of schools in Hamilton, Peel, Toronto, Windsor-Essex, and York was extended further to February 10.[44] The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), municipal police departments, bylaw officers, and provincial workspace inspectors, had the authority to issue tickets to enforce the stay-at-home order and mask mandate,[44] however they will not have the authority to stop drivers or pedestrians for questioning.[48] Premier Ford stated plans for a compliance \"blitz\" of retail store inspections beginning the weekend of January 15.[49][44] Results of the inspection \"blitz\" revealed 36 of 110 stores visited in violation of COVID-19 measures, or 70 percent compliance rate.[50] The measures faced criticism for disproportionately favouring big box retailers, by not restricting the times of day in which they may offer curbside pickup or delivery services, or preventing them from selling non-essential goods. It also does not include funding to cover paid sick leave for essential and low-wage workers.[44] On February 8, 2021, Premier Ford announced that the declaration of emergency would expire, but that the stay-at-home order would be extended in the majority of health regions to allow a gradual reinstatement of the response framework. The order was first lifted on February 10 in Eastern Ontario's Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Unit, the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit, and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit. The stay-at-home order was expected to be lifted in most of Ontario on February 16, excluding Peel, Toronto, and York (expected to occur on February 22), and any other area where the province believes it is not yet safe to lift the order. This was later amended to exclude York and include North Bay-Parry Sound.[51] Even as the restriction is lifted, the province still encourages residents to stay at home whenever possible, and discourages social gatherings and non-essential travel (including travel between regions with different levels on the response framework).[52][53][54] On February 19, 2021, York region was announced to be moving to Red (Control) on February 22 while Toronto, Peel and North Bay-Parry Sound were to remain in a stay-at-home order until at least March 8.[55] On March 5, 2021, the provincial government announced these last three regions would be moving to the response framework on March 8, officially ending stay-at-home orders originally in effect since January 14, 2021.[56] On November 3, 2020, Premier Ford stated that future modifications of restrictions during the second wave will be performed regionally using a colour-coded \"response framework\". The framework went into place on November 7.[57][58][60] On November 11, it was reported by the Toronto Star that the Ford government had allegedly ignored recommendations by Public Health Ontario regarding the metrics used for the advisory system \u2014 which were four times narrower than what was actually implemented by the government.[61] Two days later, Premier Ford announced that the thresholds for each level would be decreased: for example, the criterion for the \"Control\" (Red) level was reduced from a weekly incidence rate of 100 or more per-capita, to 40 or more.[62] Regions included in each tier were adjusted to match the new thresholds effective November 16. Ford stated that the original criterion was based on earlier models that had anticipated only 950\u20131,250 new cases per day by the time it was implemented and that he would not have used them if case numbers had reached the point they had on November 10.[62] Due to the declaration of emergency and a stay-at-home order issued, the response framework was officially considered paused from December 26, 2020, to February 9, 2021.[47] On February 8, 2021, Premier Ford announced that the response framework would be gradually reinstated to replace the stay-at-home order, beginning with the Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Unit, the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit, and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit on February 10 (which reopened into the \"Prevent\" tier). Unlike the earlier revision, the \"Lockdown\" tier will allow for non-essential retail with capacity limits (unless the region is subject to a stay-at-home order).[52][53] The framework is now subject to an \"emergency brake\", where regions may immediately be placed back in the \"Lockdown\" tier as a circuit breaker if health officials believe that the incidence rate is increasing too rapidly and the healthcare system is at a severe risk of being overwhelmed.[52][53] As of March 26, health officials may impose a stricter lockdown (equivalent to the earlier province-wide shutdown) under the emergency brake as well.[63] On March 20, further amendments to the response framework were implemented for restaurants; outdoor dining is now permitted in regions in the \"Lockdown\" tier, and capacity limits for restaurants in the \"Control\" and \"Restrict\" tiers were increased from 10 and 50 customers respectively to 50 and 100, or 50 percent capacity, whichever is lower.[64] Additional modifications were announced on March 26; as of March 29, the \"Lockdown\" category began to allow outdoor fitness classes of up to 10 people. Personal care services were to be allowed operate by-appointment only at 25 percent capacity/5 people (whichever is fewer) in \"Lockdown\" regions beginning April 12.[65][63] In addition, subject to physical distancing, capacity limits were removed for outdoor religious services (including funerals and weddings) in all regions.[65][63] On April 1, 2021, amid rising new infections, particularly exacerbated by variants of concern and preceding the Easter weekend, Premier Ford announced a third province-wide shutdown beginning April 3. All regions were moved to a new sixth level of the response framework, \"Shutdown\" (white), re-imposing measures that were introduced during the first province-wide shutdown. This includes prohibiting all indoor organized events and gatherings, limiting outdoor gatherings to five people, capacity limits for retail (50% for essential retail, 25% for all other stores), and ordering the closure of all in-person dining (regardless of setting), daycamps, personal care services, sports and recreation facilities, meeting and event spaces, and cinemas, and capping capacity of religious services to 15 percent. All performing arts facilities must close, even for internet streaming events.[66][67] The response framework is paused.[68][69][70][71] Premier Ford faced criticism over the new shutdown (which resulted in only minor changes for health regions already in the \"Lockdown\" tier), with Leader of the Opposition Andrea Horwath arguing that it was \"a too little too late response by this government to what we knew was coming\".[68] On April 4, the medical officers of Ottawa, Peel Region, and Toronto sent a letter to the government requesting that a stay-at-home order be issued.[72] On April 7, 2021, Premier Ford declared a third state of emergency and announced that a third stay-at-home order will take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on April 8, and last for four weeks. All Ontario residents must remain at their homes unless conducting an activity deemed essential. Essential activities include shopping at grocery stores or pharmacies, receiving health care, exercise, school, or conducting essential work that cannot be performed remotely. Remote work was mandated where possible.[72] Ford explained that \"the situation is evolving rapidly, hour by hour. And as things change, as we learn more about these deadly new variants, as we see new problems arise, we need to adapt. We need to move quickly and decisively. And right now, above all else, our plan is to get needles in the arms and protect our hospitals.\"[72] All shutdown restrictions and all other restrictions from the previous stay-at-home order apply. Furthermore, essential retail stores are only allowed to sell food, pharmacy items, and cleaning supplies, and all other non-essential goods are prohibited from being displayed or sold to in-store customers.[73] In addition, retailers of assistive devices, automotive and equipment rental services, motor vehicle and boat dealers, vehicle and equipment repair services, prescription eyewear, safety supplies, and telecom services may operate at 25 percent capacity by appointment only.[72] Following criticism of photos showing displays of cloth masks blocked by local Walmart stores, representatives of the government clarified that they were considered an essential good.[74] The order does not include paid sick leave; Premier Ford accused those advocating for paid sick leave of \"playing politics\", and not directing people to the Canadian Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) instead (which is a retroactive payment), which he deemed sufficient.[75] On April 16, 2021, Premier Ford announced that due to record high hospitalizations and cases, the stay-at-home order had been extended through at least May 20, and that several additional restrictions will also be imposed. Effective April 17, outdoor gatherings with anyone from outside of the immediate household are prohibited, all outdoor recreation amenities must close, allowable \"big box\" retail stores are restricted to 25% capacity, and all non-essential construction projects must be suspended. Beginning April 19, land travel into Ontario is restricted at the provincial border to essential purposes (transport of goods, medical care, work, and exercising treaty rights) only, and indoor places of worship are limited to 10 people. Furthermore, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones announced that police would receive enhanced authority to enforce the stay-at-home order, including being able to perform random stops of individuals they suspect are travelling in violation of the stay-at-home order. They could compel individuals to state their home address and purpose of travel; failure to comply with a request for this information would be a ticketable offence.[76][77] Premier Ford stated that \"I have never shied away from telling you the brutal honest truth, never shied away from tough decisions and today I am here to do just that. My friends we are losing the battle between variants and vaccines\", and that \"we need to step up enforcement and we need to focus on those who are deliberately putting others at risk by ignoring the stay-at-home order.\"[76][77] The new measures faced criticism; the province did not introduce paid sick leave,[78] the new police authority was criticized for resembling carding and having a disproportionate impact to BIPOC communities, while a number of municipal police departments announced that they would not perform random stops under the measure.[79] On April 17, Jones announced that the new police authority would be narrowed to only allow them to stop and ticket individuals they suspect are participating in a public event or social gathering. Despite the changes, the revised measures elicited continued concerns.[80][79] Criticism has also been raised over the prohibition of outdoor recreation, due to outdoor spaces being considered to have a generally lower risk of transmission over indoor spaces, and calls for the provincial government to promote outdoor recreation for physical and mental health.[81][82] The province backpedaled on restricting playgrounds, but the remainder of the order remains in effect.[83] On April 20, 2021, Peel Public Health issued a Section 22 order effective April 23, requiring any business that has been linked to five or more COVID-19 infections within the past 14 days to shut down for 10 days. All employees of the business must self-isolate for the duration, and it is \"strongly recommended\" that impacted employees be provided with paid leave. Peel Public Health stated that \"workplace exposures in Peel Region continue to drive the region's high case counts of COVID-19. Expedited closure will also allow Peel Public Health to investigate workplace exposures without risk of continued spread.\" This order will not apply to healthcare, schools, or other \"critical infrastructure\". Toronto Public Health subsequently issued a nearly identical order.[84][85][86] On April 22, 2021, in his first public appearance since April 16, and while self-isolating due to being a close contact of a positive case within his staff,[87] Premier Ford admitted that the new enforcement measures announced last Friday \"went too far\". He also announced that Ontario was working on developing a paid sick leave benefit, arguing that they needed to fill \"gaps\" in the CRSB that were not fulfilled by the 2021 federal budget, and that they planned to make it \"the best program in North America\".[88] The province officially announced the temporary \"COVID-19 Worker Income Protection Benefit Program\" on April 29, providing up to three paid sick days for full-time or part-time workers, and paying up to $200 per day. Employers will be reimbursed via the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). The program will last through September 25, 2021 (the last day of the CRSB), and is retroactive to April 19.[89] On May 13, 2021, the stay-at-home order was extended by 14 days through June 2. Premier Ford stated that the additional time was necessary in order to ensure that \"most normal July and August possible\", but that this would not allow large public gatherings such as concerts or sporting events.[90][82] On May 20, 2021, alongside the announcement of a new roadmap for lifting restrictions, Ford announced that beginning May 22, outdoor recreation amenities would be allowed to reopen, and outdoor gatherings of up to five people would also be permitted.[91][92] On May 21, 2021, with warmer weather, splash pads were opened ahead of the Victoria Day weekend.[93] On June 2, 2021, the stay-at-home order officially expired, leaving the province with some restrictions, bans on outdoor activities like camping stayed closed.[94] On June 7, 2021, it was announced Ontario would enter Step 1 on June 11 at 12:01am.[95] On May 20, 2021, Premier Ford announced a three-step plan to reopen the economy, based on vaccination rate goals. Initially, the province was to stay in each Step for a minimum of 21 days before moving onto the next. However, each reopening step was put in place before 21 days had passed.[96][97] Sectors reopening:[98] Sectors reopening: Sectors reopening: On September 1, 2021, despite having initially been against the concept as to not create a \"split society\", Premier Ford announced that the province would mandate the presentation of proof of vaccination in order to access certain non-essential indoor businesses, effective September 22, 2021. The province announced plans to also develop a verifiable digital credential in QR code format.[104] Ford criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for not developing a domestic vaccine passport at the federal level, despite him having only previously called for one to be developed for international travel.[104] Patrons 12 years of age or older must present proof of full vaccination in order to access the indoor areas of the following settings, unless otherwise noted:[105] Patrons must present the Ontario COVID-19 vaccination receipt and valid photo identification.[105] Valid medical exemptions include adverse reactions to the first vaccine dose, or life-threatening allergies to vaccine ingredients, and must be issued by a doctor.[105] On October 14, 2021, Ontario began to roll out proof of vaccination expressed as a QR code. They can be checked by businesses using the Verify Ontario mobile app.[108] The app was developed in partnership with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE).[109] Following the implementation of the proof of vaccination system, on September 25, 2021, certain venues where vaccination is mandated were given increased capacity limits. Most indoor facilities' capacity limits were increased to 50 percent or 10,000 people (whichever is higher). Certain outdoor venues where people stand were increased to 75 percent or 15,000 people (whichever is higher) and for outdoor venues where people are seated, this was increased to 75 percent or 30,000 people (whichever is higher).[110] On October 8, 2021, ahead of the opening of new seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and in the National Hockey League (NHL), Premier Ford announced that capacity limits would be lifted for certain venues and events where proof of vaccination is required, including cinemas, theatres, and concerts, the seating areas of sports, recreation, and racing facilities, meeting and event spaces (subject to social distancing), and the studio audiences of commercial film and television productions.[111] This decision faced criticism from the restaurant industry for being a double standard, noting that indoor arenas would be allowed to operate at full capacity with nearly 20,000 spectators, but restaurants are still subject to capacity limits. An Ontario government spokesperson stated that restaurants were deemed a higher-risk setting due to patrons not wearing masks for prolonged periods.[112] The involvement of MLSE\u2014owner of most of Toronto's professional sports teams\u2014in the development of the Verify Ontario app was also scrutinized by the industry, who accused the provincial government of favouring the interests of larger corporations over small businesses. Ford denied the accusations, stating that the changes impacted multiple industries beyond just sports. MLSE stated that they were being a \"good corporate citizen\", and their involvement primarily involved refinements to a beta version of the app. They also highlighted other contributions they had made in support of the pandemic response, including use of their facilities as homeless shelters and vaccination sites.[113] On October 22, 2021, Premier Ford announced a long-term plan to eventually lift the remaining public health measures;[114] On October 28, 2021, restrictions on the capacity of general admission indoor concerts were lifted, including the requirement that all patrons be seated. This was moved ahead from the original second step on November 15.[116] On November 10, 2021, the lifting of capacity restrictions for \"high-risk\" venues was delayed for at least 28 days out of an abundance of caution due to rising indicators.[115] On December 7, 2021, this was delayed indefinitely.[117] On December 10, 2021, citing the spread of the Omicron variant, Ontario announced upcoming changes to the proof of vaccination requirements, which have henceforth been extended indefinitely. Beginning December 20, the previous exemption to the proof of vaccination requirement for youth under 18 years of age participating in organized sports was removed. Beginning January 4, 2022, only a certified QR code is accepted as valid proof of vaccination or medical exemption. Notes from physicians are no longer accepted effective January 10, 2022.[107][118] On December 15, 2021, Premier Ford announced that due to the Omicron variant, a 50 percent capacity limit would be reintroduced for meeting and event spaces, indoor sports venues with a capacity over 1,000, and indoor entertainment venues.[119] On December 17, Ford also announced that permissible social gatherings would be reduced to 10 people outdoors and 25 outdoors, and most indoor settings will be restricted to 50 percent capacity (unless being used for a faith-based ceremony). Mingling and dancing at bars and restaurants is prohibited. All venues will be subject to a 10 p.m. last call for alcohol sales, and all bars, restaurants, and strip clubs must close to dining at 11 p.m. In addition, all event venues and casinos will be prohibited from serving food and beverages.[120][121] On December 30, 2021, Ontario further restricted venues to a maximum of 1,000 spectators or 50 percent capacity, whichever is less. MLSE announced that all Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors home games will be played behind closed doors while this restriction is in effect.[122] On January 3, 2022, Premier Ford announced that to protect the hospital system, Ontario would be rolled back to modified Step 2 beginning January 5, 2022 for least 21 days:[123][124] On January 20, 2022, the province announced plans to ease some of these restrictions beginning January 31, 2022:[126][127] On March 21, 2022, all capacity restrictions, proof of vaccination requirements, and face masks are optional. At least 21 days must elapse between each phase.[126][127]","Title":"Provincial government response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10681","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_government_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Ontario"}
