{"Content: ":"The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to serious environmental consequences. The invasion has resulted in forest fires, air pollution, soil contamination, water pollution, inundation and damage to nature reserves. This has placed increased stress on ecosystems and the environment, accelerating the climate crisis. Fires caused by fighting in the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve were large enough to be seen from space.[1] It has also accelerated the renewable energy transition in Germany.[2] As a result of hostilities in March 2022 (mostly from 10 to 18 March), the entire network of large metallurgical and chemical industries concentrated in eastern Ukraine was completely destroyed. Among the many industrial enterprises damaged as a result of hostilities were the most environmentally unsafe industries \u2013 Azovstal, Avdiivka, Lysychansk Refinery, Sumykhimprom and others. These enterprises have traditionally posed the greatest danger to the environment in Ukraine and formed the image of one of the most polluted in Ukraine for the cities of their location. At the same time, before its destruction, Azovstal managed to stop the processes in such a way that the damaged facilities did not pose a threat to the environment. On 24 February, the company's management began to develop a program of environmentally safe shutdown. Coke ovens were stopped, the temperature was lowered, and liquid glass was poured in to prevent the coking process from continuing and the coke oven gas to be released as intensively as possible.[3] Coal mines throughout eastern Ukraine have deteriorated rapidly,[4] as active and expanded hostilities have made difficult for maintenance projects to continue. The potential for pollution of ground and surface water throughout the entire Donbas region has been observed. Without adequate human regulation, various sites could spill fuel and leak pollutants.[5] Environmental risks of nuclear energy facilities within war-zones and bombing/shelling of or near them \u2013 as well as of waste-sites[6] \u2013 have become clearer and continue to be a concern to experts.[7][8][9] Oil depots were among the first to be affected (in addition, they became the most common category of man-made hazards in various regions). At least 60 oil depots and other storage facilities for fuel and lubricants in 23 oblasts were affected.[10] The second group of targeted shelling was warehouses of flammable substances (varnishes, paints) and large construction supermarkets of the Epicenter chain. Also on 17 March, a powerful fire engulfed the largest market in Europe: Barabashovo (Kharkiv). The fire was so strong that it spread to several apartment buildings next to the market.[11] Among other objects that became a source of air pollution due to the shelling was the destruction of the gas pipeline in Kharkov on 27 February, which led to a powerful explosion and shock wave that damaged buildings in residential areas. On 10 March, in Svitlodarsk, a large fire lasted several hours; on the same day, Russian aircraft struck the Donetsk-Mariupol gas highway, where an explosion and fire occurred. Three days later, on 13 March, a fire began on the gas pipeline at the Avdiivka Coke Plant after shelling,[12] and a gas pipeline in Trostyanets was damaged on 23 March. In general, there is very little information about damage to gas pipelines in the public domain, although it is known that as of 5 March 2022 as a result of shelling was recorded shells hit the gas transmission system of Ukraine in Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Kyiv, Donetsk, Luhansk regions of Ukraine.[10] On 21 March, in Sumy at the Sumykhimprom enterprise, missiles hit tanks filled with ammonia, forming a zone of damage with a radius of up to 2.5 km, which can be compared with the actual use of chemical weapons.[13] Also on 5 and 9 April, in Rubezhnoye, the Russians blew up a tank with nitric acid.[14][15] On 4 April, a cruise missile was shot down by air defense forces in the Kremenets district of Ternopil region. Its wreckage damaged six tanks filled with organic fertilizers, resulting in a leak of chemicals, the main component of which is ammonia. In a few hours the leak was stopped. The leak caused water pollution in the Ikva River, which led to the mass death of fish.[16] There is one example of the fundamental transformation of natural landscapes caused by the direct actions of Russian troops against Ukraine. On 26 February 2022 in the area of the village Kozarovichi [uk] Russian troops destroyed the dam that separated the Irpin River from the Kiev Reservoir. In one and a half months, the water from the reservoir flooded the floodplain of Irpen up to the village Horenka, which is more than 10 kilometers (straight line distance) upstream.[17] Destroyed dam The village of Demydiv is flooded Consequences of the destruction of the dam on the river Irpin An expert recommended an \"overhaul of Ukraine's economy, which is very energy intensive and oriented on production of raw materials\" for it \"to become a new industrial and renewable energy hub for Europe but based on clean technologies\".[5]","Title":"Environmental impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16388","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine"}
