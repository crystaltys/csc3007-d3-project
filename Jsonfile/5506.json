{"Content: ":"The Rhode Island Democratic Party is the affiliate of the Democratic Party in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Joseph McNamara is the chair of the party. It is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling both of Rhode Island's U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, the governorship, and has supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature. For nearly five decades, Rhode Island has been one of the United States' most solidly Democratic states. Since 1928, it has voted for the Republican presidential candidate only four times (Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1984) and has elected only two Republicans (former Governor John H. Chafee and his son, Lincoln Chafee, though the younger Chafee became a Democrat during his later governorship) to the U.S. Senate since 1934. Rhode Island sent no Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives from 1940 until 1980, when one Republican and one Democrat were elected. In 1980, Rhode Island was one of only six states to be won by incumbent president Jimmy Carter. However, Republican Edward DiPrete was elected governor in 1984 and Ronald Reagan narrowly carried the state in the 1984 presidential election. In the 2000 presidential election, Democrat Al Gore won 61% of the popular vote in the state.[2] An analysis of Gallup polling data shows the Democratic advantage over the Republican Party in Rhode Island voters plunged between 2008 and 2011.[3] The Democratic advantage over the Republican Party in Rhode Island slid from 37 percentage points in 2008 to 16, according to Gallup. Rhode Island went from the most Democratic state in the country in 2008 to the 7th most Democratic in 2011.[4] Democrats have controlled both of Rhode Island's seats in the U.S. Senate since 2006: Junior U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Senior U.S. Senator Jack Reed Out of the 2 seats Rhode Island is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, both are held by Democrats: Democrats control all five of the elected statewide offices: The leadership of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, as of 2021, is as follows: ","Title":"Rhode Island Democratic Party - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5506","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_Democratic_Party"}
