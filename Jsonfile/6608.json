{"Content: ":"The Frankfurt Art Association (German: Frankfurter Kunstverein) is an art museum founded in 1829 by a group of influential citizens of the city of Frankfurt, Germany. The aim of the institution is to support the arts in the city, which was an important center of trade and business. Works of art were bought and exhibitions organized in order to open access to art and culture for the public. Among the founders were Johann Gerhard Christian Thomas, a senator and later mayor of the city, historian Johann Friedrich Böhmer, and art historian Johann David Passavant. Soon after the establishment of the museum, many important and influential citizens and artists became members. Today, the museum is situated in the center of Frankfurt, in a gothic building from 1464 called the Steinernes Haus ('Stone Building'), near the city's town hall. There are around 1,700 members who support the activities and enable the museum to reach its aim today, more than 150 years after its establishment. Although the museum has no permanent collection, as art is not purchased any more, its exhibitions of contemporary art are internationally renowned. Furthermore, guided tours, symposia, film programs, and excursions are organized. So even in the neighbourhood of important museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art (Museum für Moderne Kunst) and Schirn Gallery (Schirn Kunsthalle), the museum manages to assert itself as an important meeting point not only for Frankfurt's art scene. Especially young artists of the state-run art school (Städelschule ) and the well-known design school HFG are closely connected with the museum and cooperation is common.
