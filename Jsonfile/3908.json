They are distributed over 63 of Colorado's 64 counties; only the City and County of Broomfield has none. \u2003 \u2003 This National Park Service list is complete through NPS recent listings posted July 15, 2022.[1]  The following are approximate tallies of current listings by county. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008[2] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[3] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis.[4] Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number. The numbers of NRHP listings in each county are documented by tables in each of the individual county list-articles. There are no places in the City and County of Broomfield currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
