{"Content: ":"The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII or PFII) is the UN's central coordinating body for matters relating to the concerns and rights of the world's indigenous peoples. There are more than 370 million indigenous people (also known as native, original, aboriginal and first peoples) in some 70 countries worldwide. The forum was created in 2000 as an outcome of the UN's International Year for the World's Indigenous People in 1993, within the first International Decade of the World's Indigenous People (1995\u20132004). It is an advisory body within the framework of the United Nations System that reports to the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Resolution 45/164 of the United Nations General Assembly was adopted on 18 December 1990, proclaiming that 1993 would be the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, \"with a view to strengthening international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous communities in areas such as human rights, the environment, development, education and health\".[1][2] The year was launched in Australia by Prime Minister Paul Keating's memorable Redfern speech on 10 December 1992, in which he addressed Indigenous Australians' disadvantage.[3] The creation of the permanent forum was discussed at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Austria. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action recommended that such a forum should be established within the first United Nations International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples.[4] A working group was formed and various other meetings took place that led to the establishment of the permanent forum by Economic and Social Council Resolution 2000/22 on 28 July 2000.[5] It submits recommendations to the Council on issues related to indigenous peoples. It holds a two-week session each year which takes place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City but it could also take place in Geneva or any other place as decided by the forum.[citation needed] The mandate of the Forum is to discuss indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health and human rights. The forum is to:[6][7] The forum is composed of 16 independent experts, functioning in their personal capacity, who are appointed to three-year terms. At the end of their term, they can be re-elected or re-appointed for one additional term. Of these 16 members, eight are nominated by the member governments and eight directly nominated by indigenous organizations. Those nominated by the governments are then elected to office by the Economic and Social Council based on the five regional groupings of the United Nations. Whereas those nominated by indigenous organisations are appointed by the President of the Economic and Social Council and represent the seven socio-cultural regions for broad representation of the world's indigenous peoples.[7] To date, eighteen sessions have been held, all at UN Headquarters, New York:[9] The Secretariat of the PFII was established by the General Assembly in 2002 with Resolution 57/191.[12] It is based in the New York within the Division for Inclusive Social Development (DISD) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).[13] The Secretariat, among other things, prepares the annual sessions of the Forum, provides support and assistance to the Forum's members, promotes awareness of indigenous issues within the UN system, governments and the public, and serves as a source of information and a coordination point for indigenous-related efforts. The first International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, \"Indigenous People: Partnership in Action\" (1995\u20132004), was proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 48/163 with the main objective of strengthening international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous peoples in areas such as human rights, environment, development, health and education.[14] The Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, \"Partnership for Action and Dignity\" (2005\u20132015), was proclaimed by the General Assembly at its 59th session, and the programme of action was adopted at the 60th session.[15] Its objectives are: On 28 February 2020, 500 participants of a high-level assembly adopted the \"Los Pinos Declaration\" which concentrates on the indigenous language users' human rights. To ensure diversity, members are elected from different regions depending on who nominated them:[7] Africa Eurasia North America Oceania South America","Title":"United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9027","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Permanent_Forum_on_Indigenous_Issues"}
