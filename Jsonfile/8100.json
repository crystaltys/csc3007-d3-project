{"Content: ":"SM-130686 is a small-molecule drug which acts as a potent, orally-active agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and growth hormone secretagogue,[1] with around half the potency of the endogenous agonist ghrelin as a stimulator of growth hormone release.[2][3] It produces dose-dependent increases in muscle mass and decrease in body fat, and is under investigation for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency and other medical conditions.[4] Concerns about its potential use as a performance-enhancing drug for athletes have led to the development of urine tests for SM-130686 and other GHSR agonists, even though no drugs from this class have yet progressed to clinical use.[5] This hormonal preparation article is a stub.
