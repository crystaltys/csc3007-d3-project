Vladimir Solovyov was born into a Jewish family.[10][11] His father, Rudolf Naumovich Solovyov (born Vinitskovsky), and his mother, Inna Solomonovna Solovyova (née Shapiro), both graduated from the history and philology department of the Moscow State V. I. Lenin Pedagogical Institute. Later, his father taught political economy at a school of statistics, while his mother worked as an art critic at the Battle of Borodino museum. In 1980, he graduated from the elite, English-language secondary School no. 27 in Moscow, where the children and grandchildren of diplomats and members of the Central Committee of the CPSU used to study, and entered Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys, graduating in 1986. In 1989, Solovyov completed graduate studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow with the defence of his thesis \"Basic tendencies of new materials production and its efficiency factors in the USA and Japan\" and became a candidate of economic science (a PhD, second (of three) Russian graduate degrees in economics). He taught physics, mathematics, and astronomy at the School No. 27 until 1990.[citation needed] In 1999 he first appeared as a presenter on two TV talk shows: The Process on the ORT channel (with Alexander Gordon) (1999-2001) and Passion for Solovyov on the TNT channel (1999-2002), which were followed by his own projects Breakfast with Solovyov and Nightingale Night on TV6 (the latter being the final show broadcast on the station before it was shut down in early 2002), as well as Look Who's Coming!, Duel on TVS and Orange Juice on NTV. Since 2003 and 2005, respectively, he has been hosting two more programmes on NTV \u2013 political talk show On the Stand and weekly news commentary programme Sunday Night in a talk-show format. In the fall of 2005, Vladimir Solovyov was awarded the TEFI Russian television prize as the best interviewer.[12] In December 2004, Solovyov featured as a solo singer in his first CD album Solovyinye Treli (Nightingale Warbles). Currently, he is the presenter of a TV talk show, Duel on Rossiya 1 (2010\u20132014, 2015\u20132017). Solovyov also hosts a debate show, Sunday evening with Vladimir Solovyov, on Rossiya 1. Since September 2, 2018 \u2014 host of the \"Moscow. Kremlin. Putin\" on the channel \"Russia-1\",[13] in which for 1 hour he talks about the deeds done by the president over the past week.[14] The intonation of the program, the selection of guests (in the premiere, they turned out to be only persons connected with the power: the president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov and the State Duma deputy from United Russia Andrei Makarov), the co-host (VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin), and thus prompted a number of media outlets to think about this as an attempt to raise the rating of the current head of state, which has fallen due to the pension reform [ru], and the emergence of a personality cult different from the Soviet era.[15][16][17][18][19][20] On 23 February 2022, a day before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Solovyov was sanctioned by the European Union. He is barred from entering the EU countries, and his assets there, if they exist, are frozen.[21] His villa on Lake Como, Italy, was seized.[22] Total number of seized properties with a value of 8 million euros is unknown.[23][24] In the lead-up to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Solovyov claimed that Russia has \"enough firepower for the full annihilation of the Ukrainian military infrastructure without an incursion of forces into Ukrainian territory. But we aren't preparing to do this.\"[25] He later voiced support for Putin's invasion of Ukraine, saying that \"Today is the day that a righteous operation was launched for the de-Nazification in Ukraine.\"[26][27] On 27 February 2022 Solovyov said he had been placed on a list of international sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and that his ownership of real estate in Lake Como, Italy was at risk.[28] Later, on March 5, 2022, The Guardian wrote that the Financial Guard of Italy seized his villa, along with billionaire Alisher Usmanov's property.[29] On April 6, 2022, his villa on the shores of Lake Como caught fire and was severely damaged, in what was probably an intentional fire.[30] In March 2022 Solovyov warned: \"if you think we're going to stop with Ukraine, think 300 times, I will remind you that Ukraine is merely an intermediate stage in the provision of the safety of the Russian Federation.\"[31] He accused Western-backed Ukrainian \"Banderites\" of attempting to assassinate him because he is \"Jewish anti-fascist.\"[10] On 20 April 2022, Solovyov talked on Russian state TV about a new stage of the war that started as part of the \"special operation\" against Ukraine. He said this new stage of war would be against \"NATO's war machine and all its citizens\", asserting that Russia \"will show no mercy\".[32][33] On 26 April 2022, while discussing the possibility of World War III and nuclear war with Solovyov on The Evening with Vladimir Solovyov, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said, \"Personally, I think that the most realistic way is the way of World War III, based on knowing us and our leader, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin knowing how everything works around here, it's impossible\u2014there is no chance\u2014that we will give up\u2026We're all going to die someday.\" Solovyov added, \"But we will go to heaven, while they will simply croak.\"[34] Igor Albin, former Vice Governor of Saint Petersburg, wrote on his Telegram channel: \"Crazy 'propagandists' will burn in hell. You don't scold your own in times of war, but you shouldn't be proud of them either. There will be no winners in a nuclear war!\"[35] In June 2022, Solovyov warned that the US-UK military shipments to Ukraine were seen by the Kremlin as an escalation of the conflict, saying that \"I hope we'll live through this. If everything keeps progressing the way that it is, only a couple of mutants in Lake Baikal will survive; the rest will be destroyed in a massive nuclear strike.\"[36] On 13 May 2022, he complained that Russian troops were being sent to Ukraine with \"hopelessly obsolete weapons.\"[37] On October 19, 2006, as a presenter, he participated in a televised debate between the candidates for the post of the head of the Samara city district, Viktor Tarkhov and Georgy Limansky. During and after the broadcast, Solovyov insulted Tarkhov. After that, the candidate filed a lawsuit against him for 10 million rubles. After a year and a half, the original jurisdiction partially satisfied the claim, deciding to collect 70 thousand rubles from the defendant.[38] On February 19, 2014, on the air of the Full Contact program, Solovyov announced that \"under the auspices of\" the Faculty of Applied Political Science at the Higher School of Economics, \"organized terrorist groups\" were operating, which were preparing the \"Maidan underground\".[39] The university made a statement that they reacted negatively to both Solovyov's statements and students' remarks, and attempts to link the educational institution with the political position of the participants in the scandal were regarded there as a provocation.[40][41] In June 2014, businessman Sergei Polonsky appealed to the Savelovsky court of Moscow with a claim for the protection of honour and compensation for moral damage in the amount of 200 million rubles against the \"Vesti FM\" radio station and Solovyov because of his broadcast in November 2013.[42] Polonsky lost the lawsuit.[43] In August 2014, the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine included Solovyov in the sanctions list for his position on the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the war in eastern Ukraine.[44] In June 2016, he intervened in the election campaign, harshly criticizing the KVN actress Yulia Mikhalkova-Matyukhina, who took the \"passing place\" in the primaries of United Russia in the Sverdlovsk region, who built her campaign under the slogan \"I can take care of myself, I can also take care of the country\".[45] After that Mikhalkova-Matyukhina withdrew her candidacy.[46] In September 2017, during the broadcast of Channel One's program Evening Urgant, its presenter, in response to the remark of the former TV presenter of the MTV Russia channel Irena Ponaroshku, about the face mask from the nightingale droppings brought to her studio, said: \"First of all, this is a good name for a show on the \"Russia\" channel...\".[47][48] An episode of the show did not go unnoticed by Solovyov: a few days after this TV broadcast, in his live program for the Far East, he made the following speech: \"I know a great way to avoid getting into the Myrotvorets. It's enough to make a nasty joke about me on your channel\".[49] When broadcasting the release of Solovyov's program to Moscow, this comment was cut out at the request of the presenter himself. Later, in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, Solovyov regarded the passage of Urgant as a \"declaration of war\".[50] In November 2018, a picket was held in St. Petersburg against Vladimir Solovyov.[51] The police detained seven people, six of whom were soon released. A protocol was drawn up against one of the participants in the picket, Pavel Ivankin, under an administrative article on disobeying the lawful demand of a police officer. The picket participants, in particular, compared Solovyov with Julius Streicher, one of the main propagandists of Nazi Germany, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Der Stürmer.[51][52] In May 2019, during the protests in Yekaterinburg against the construction of the Cathedral of St. Catherine in the park near the Drama Theatre, Vladimir Solovyov called the protesting people \"demons\" and \"devils\", and promised to visit the city to purge them.[53] In response to Solovyov, they began to sue him, he was even challenged to a duel.[54] On April 12, 2020, in response to insults from Solovyov, sports commentator Vasily Utkin called him a \"pederastic monkey\".[55] The politician Yevgeny Roizman said that pederastic monkeys are offended by such a comparison.[56] On April 12, 2020, Vasily Utkin, on the air of Panopticon on Dozhd TV channel about the COVID-19 pandemic, said that he did not need a state like Russia.[57] Utkin also said that even without the sanction of the state, he could sit out at home during a pandemic. In response to this remark, Vladimir Solovyov called Utkin a mentally ill person, whose words cannot discredit the Russian state.[58] In response to this, on April 15, Vasily Utkin turned to Solovyov with a proposal to conduct a face-to-face \"battle\" in the form of a verbal fight.[59] Solovyov refused to participate in the \"battle\".[60] The media often describe Solovyov as a propagandist.[3][4][6][8][61] Solovyov regularly talks about his patriotism,[62] the rapid development of Russia under Putin and the decline of the West.[63] On November 21, 2007, at a pre-election rally forum in Luzhniki, Solovyov spoke in support of Vladimir Putin and described him as a \"strong, intelligent, talented leader\" who loves the Motherland and does everything to make Russians proud of their country.[64] In 2011, the religious community of Mountain Jews in Azerbaijan sent a note of protest to the leadership of the Vesti FM radio station, as well as to the Russian Jewish Congress, in connection with Solovyov's statements about the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Vesti FM air. Solovyov in his broadcast compared the Holocaust and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict:[65] A drop of Armenian blood for them is the subject of wild inhuman, I would say, bestial hatred. That is, for me as a Jew, this hatred frankly resembles the tragedy of my people and the Holocaust. At the end of February 2014, together with a number of other pro-Putin journalists, public and political figures signed an appeal for the \"All of us are Berkut\" foundation, which was created mainly to support the members of the Ukrainian special unit \"Berkut\" which was involved in violence and shootings against Ukrainian protesters during Euromaidan and the Orange Revolution.[66] Regarding the armed conflict in east Ukraine, Solovyov's position mirrored that of president Putin and the Russian government: that the conflict was between the fascists of the Ukrainian maidan and the anti-fascists of the rebel-held eastern territories.[67] Solovyov has changed his opinion on different questions numerous times; for example, the Crimean problem. Solovyov on Crimea:[68] In June 2017, Solovyov called participants in an anti-corruption rally in Moscow \"the eternal two percent of shit\", \"children of corrupt officials\" and \"majoritarian imbeciles\", and he also stated that \"if not for the police, the (counter protest) people would tear them to shreds\". The statement was criticized by journalist Alexander Nevzorov. Solovyov continued to use similar remarks against some audience members and Russian opposition journalists.[69][70][71] In September 2017, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) discovered that Solovyov has a villa on Lake Como, Italy,[3][72][73] three apartments in Moscow and a house in the Moscow region. FBK estimates the total cost of Solovyov's real estate in Moscow, the Moscow region and Pianello del Lario at 1 billion rubles ($17 mil).[74] Subsequently, in 2019, FBK discovered that Solovyov owned another villa on Lake Como and a Maybach car.[75][76][77] In July 2019, FBK found that Solovyov has an Italian permanent residency;[78] the next day, the founder of FBK, Alexei Navalny, was arrested.[79] On September 28, 2019, Boris Grebenshchikov uploaded the song \"Evening M\" on his YouTube channel, which described a typical television propagandist.[80] Solovyov claimed that Grebenshchikov had \"degraded to a coupletist,\" and also that \"there is a program in Russia that has the word \"Evening\" in its name, alluding to the program \"Evening Urgant\".[81] Grebenshchikov replied: \"There is an insurmountable distance between \"Evening U\" and \"Evening M\" - as between dignity and shame.\"[82] Evening Urgant's Ivan Urgant parsed the song, hinting in many ways that it is about Solovyov.[83] Solovyov then argued that the song is dedicated to the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky.[84][85] The phrase \"Evening M\" have become associated with Solovyov, and journalist Vladimir Pozner expressed the opinion that \"he deserved what he got\" and that Solovyov does great harm to journalism, and he \"will not shake his hand at a meeting\".[86][87][88] In September 2019, the song \"Evening Bullshitter [ru]\" was dedicated to Solovyov.[89][90] In October 2019, he got into the Guinness Book of Records for the longest time on television as a host in the span of one week (25 hours 53 minutes and 57 seconds).[91] On October 30, 2019, the British television channel Channel 4 released the film The World According to Putin. It is a 50-minute set of fragments of Russian political talk shows and Vladimir Putin's speeches. The film included statements by Solovyov, in particular, that \"Britain has degraded to the level of a public toilet\". According to The Guardian columnist Stuart Jeffries, the film displayed the \"propaganda machine in full swing \u2013 just the thing to distract from a nation in chaos\".[92][93][94] In February 2020, FBK lawyer Alexander Golovach turned to the Investigative Committee with a request to check Solovyov's documentary Mussolini. Sunset on the subject of violation of the law \"On counteraction to the rehabilitation of Nazism\" and other normative legal acts. Golovach, in particular, referred to the statements of President Putin and the text of the National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation, mentioning fascism.[95] In May 2020, a petition on change.org started collecting signatures for banning Solovyov from entering Italy and the EU. The petition was addressed to the Italian Interior Minister, Luciana Lamorgese, and received the support of more than 200,000 people.[96][97] Solovyov refused to comment on the appearance of this initiative.[98] In February 2021, Solovyov was banned from the Clubhouse social networking app.[99][100] In Latvia, Solovyov was included on the list of personae non gratae after he compared jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny with Adolf Hitler, saying that Hitler was a \"very brave man\" and \"unlike this codpiece Führer [Navalny], he [Hitler] did not get out of army service.\"[101][102] Alla Gerber, president of the Russian Research and Educational Holocaust Centre, said:[103] He's crazy and dangerous. Such people are unpredictable, they can say, do, hit, humiliate anything they want. It took a very long time to think, for years, probably, in order to come to such a lofty discovery - to compare the oppositionist, a man who is fighting for democracy, with Hitler. You have to be a madman and a very bad person. To call Hitler a brave man - we must boldly call Solovyov a scoundrel. Once, when Solovyov was more or less like a man, he came up to me and said: \"Allochka, but you know, I am a Jew\". I told him that he is a disgrace to our nation. Now I repeat this: he is not only a disgrace to my nation, he is a disgrace to all our people, to any decent community. I'm just in a fury. Solovyov has been married three times and has eight children: his eldest daughter Polina Solovyova attends[as of?] the University of Radio and Television, his son Alexander studies at a college in the UK, while his daughter Ekaterina studies in a Moscow English-language secondary school. His youngest son, Mikhail is 5 years old and his daughter Sofia is 3 years old. Presently he is married to Helga Solovyova (née Sepp), a psychologist and daughter of a known Russian satirist Viktor Koklyushkin. She has Volga German and Estonian descent on her mother's side.[104] In April 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) had stopped a Ukrainian neo-Nazi plot to kill Solovyov; the FSB then released video of a raid of the alleged plotters' flat, where a book signed with the words \"Signature unclear\", a green wig, three The Sims video game boxes, a Nazi-styled t-shirt, portrait of Adolf Hitler, and Ukrainian passports were shown. Nataliya Vasilyeva of The Daily Telegraph reported that the video \"raised suspicions that the foiled plot may have been a Russian intelligence hoax\", as the signature seemed like \"an apparent instruction carried out too literally\", while The Sims boxes being shown could be an error \"instead of mobile phone Sim cards that would have helped frame the plot.\" The supposed Ukrainian passports were also noted to have been outdated.[105][106] National Security Agent \u2014 2 (Episode 24 \u2014 Killing Technology) Just you... or rich Lisa Goddess of Prime Time Soviet period park","Title":"Vladimir Solovyov (TV presenter) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16036","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_(journalist)"}
