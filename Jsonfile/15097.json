{"Content: ":"Anti-separatist bloc (25) The Congress of New Caledonia (French: Congrès de la Nouvelle-Calédonie), a \"territorial congress\" (congrès territorial or congrès du territoire), is the legislature of New Caledonia. It has 54 members who serve five-year terms, selected proportionally based on the partisan makeup of all three assemblies of the provinces of New Caledonia with a 5% threshold. The political parties, aside from naturally being split based on socioeconomic ideological differences, are split along hard-line stances on possible New Caledonian independence from France. Both independentists and its opponents subscribe to various socioeconomic ideologies so the difference of opinion is usually rooted in favouring either Kanak nationalism, New Caledonian separatism and independence as opposed to French nationalism and New Caledonian regionalism.
