{"Content: ":"Norwegian Church Aid (NCA; Norwegian: Kirkens NÃ¸dhjelp) is a Norwegian humanitarian and ecumenical organisation with headquarters in Oslo. It was traditionally affiliated with the state Church of Norway, but is now independent. Norwegian Church Aid works together with people and organisations across the world to eradicate poverty and injustice. NCA provides emergency assistance in disasters and works for long-term development in local communities. In order to address the root causes of poverty, NCA advocates for just decisions by public authorities, business and religious leaders. Norwegian Church Aid is an ecumenical organisation for global justice. Its projects are carried out with no intention of influencing people's religious affiliation. To ensure efficiency and create results, Norwegian Church Aid is a member of the ACT Alliance, one of the world's largest humanitarian alliances. The alliance consists of church-based organisations throughout the world and cooperates with organisations across religious faiths. Norwegian Church Aid works in three ways: The organisation works in over 30 countries in Africa, Asia and Central and Latin America.[1] In 2018 the Norwegian Church Aid and five other key NGOs organise the customary torchlight parade in Oslo in honour of that year's Nobel Peace Prize laureates, Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, who were awarded the prize for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.[2] Norwegian Church Aid\u2019s youth movement, Changemaker, organises campaigns, courses, camps and local projects for its many thousands of members aged 13 - 30.
