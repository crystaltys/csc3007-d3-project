{"Content: ":"Science Advances is a peer-reviewed multidisciplinary open-access scientific journal established in early 2015 and published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[1] The journal's scope includes all areas of science, including life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, computer sciences, and environmental sciences. The journal was announced in February 2014, and the first articles were published in early 2015.[2] In 2019, Science Advances surpassed Science magazine in the number of monthly submissions, becoming the largest member in the Science family of journals. It is the only member of that family where all papers are gold open access. Editorial decisions are made by the editorial board. The board is divided into editorial groups, each of which is led by a deputy editor and composed of a group of associate editors.[3] Unlike other members of the Science family of journals published by AAAS, editors at Science Advances are working scientists. As of 2019[update], the article processing charge for articles published under a CC BY-NC or CC BY license is $4,500. When the journal was launched, this policy was initially criticized by open access advocates, who preferred the less restrictive CC BY license.[4][5][6][7]","Title":"Science Advances - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11868","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Advances"}
