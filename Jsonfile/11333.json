According to the WHO, the supply chain may need to cover more than 30% of the world's needs in the acute phase of the pandemic. WHO announced that the World Food Programme will need to deploy eight 747 aircraft, eight medium-sized cargo aircraft and several smaller passenger planes to move the equipment and staff.[1] This article about the COVID-19 pandemic is a stub.
