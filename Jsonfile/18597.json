It stars Laurence Leboeuf, Glynnis O'Connor, Chris Meyer, Raviv Ullman and RZA. The film will not be released in theaters as a distribution deal was not able to be successfully negotiated spurring contention with Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, residents as $500,000 in tax payer funds was used to finance the film.[1] Subsequently, the Scranton Cultural Center hosted a free premiere of the film on July 9, 2015, with additional showings on July 10, 2015 and July 11, 2015.[2]  This 2010s drama film\u2013related article is a stub.
