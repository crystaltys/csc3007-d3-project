Officials thought that it might be due to the 'unlocking' of the state, mass influx of from Chennai and inter-district movement.[91] Starting from 24 June, Madurai and Theni districts entered stricter lockdowns following the rise.[92][93] The state also re-imposed restrictions on inter-district travel till June 30.[94] The total case count crossed 2 lakh mark in the state, with 2,06,737 cases on 25 July.

The Delhi Tablighi Jamaat cluster accounts for 1,113 cases of all reported according to the Department of Health.[56] The first case was reported on 31 March 2020.[22] The highest single day rise due to the cluster was on 1 April when 110 cases linked to it were reported.[29] As of 5 May 2020, the cluster accounts for over 600 cases in the state.[102][103] As of 9 May, the cluster accounts for 1867 cases in the state.[104] Most infected are between the age range of 13-60 and are predominantly male.[105][106] As per the protocol set by the ICMR and the state, patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) are tested for COVID-19.[109][110] Their contacts are traced and quarantined; tested if they develop symptoms. If they are a high-risk contact, they are tested even if they are asymptomatic.[110] International travel passengers and passengers from other states are tested and quarantined till their results come. If found positive, they are moved to hospitals.[111][110] Health care workers are tested if they show symptoms.[110] During the first half of March, the state faced criticism for the low number of tests. By 16 March, it had only tested 90 samples while neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka had tested more than 1500 and 750 samples.[112] The director of Public Health defended the state's low number of tests by saying that Kerala saw more travel from coronavirus-affected countries which is why it had detected more cases.[113] The Public Health department had also said that the state follows test protocols established by the Union Health Ministry.[113][112] Following the Delhi Nizamuddin event, the families of all identified participants were tested regardless of whether they showed symptoms or not.[33] By 16 March, following ICMR's guidelines to test for community transmission, the state had tested 22 random samples of people with influenza and SARI for coronavirus. All tested negative.[113] By 10 April, of 577 SARI patients tested, five were positive.[114][115] In June, 199 Influenza Like Illness (ILI) cases were identified among the 3048 people who attended fever camps set up in Chennai's worst-affected Royapuram zone.[116] In early April, Tamil Nadu had the highest the percentage of positive samples among total samples tested in the country at 13%. It was attributed to detection of cases related to the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi.[117] On 12 April, the state health officials changed the testing strategy to \"aggressive testing\", also including asymptomatic individuals for tests.[118] The Health Secretary also said that the state will employ the 24,000 real time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test kits that it has in possession for more stringent testing.[119] The move was welcomed health professionals. On 14 April, the Chennai Corporation revealed that it plans to collect 40,000 swab samples, including 10,000 from the containment zones. It had set up 35 walk-in kiosks for the purpose.[120] By 19 April, the state's number of tests per 10,000 people had increased from 0.4 on 1 April to 4.1, which was almost a seven-fold increase.[64] In mid-May, the state was testing at a rate of 10,000 to 14,000 samples per day, on an average.[121] The state procured 100,000 RT-PCR test kits from a South Korean firm, as part of a 10 lakh kit order.[122] On 2 June, the chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami said that the state had received 11.51 lakh RT-PCR kits so far (of which 5.03 lakh were expended).[123] On 17 June, daily testing crossed 25,000 in the state for the first time.[124] Tamil Nadu also became the first state in the country to cross the 20,000 test per day mark.[125] Total tests till date was 773,707.[126] Most of tests were being done in Chennai (23% of all samples) and neighboring districts. As of 8 June, the district with highest positivity rate was Chennai (18.13%), followed by Chengalpattu (13.28%), Tiruvallur (11.96) and Ariyalur (9.62%).[127] Amid strict 14-day lockdown from 19 to 30 June in Chennai and three other districts, the government looked to increase testing and tracing of the disease in a bid to control its spread.[128] The chief minister said that the curbs were being used to further augment detection of COVID-19 cases in Chennai by conducting more door-to-door surveys and fever camps. On the second day of the lockdown, 33,231 samples were tested which was the state's highest in a single day.[129] On 6 April after ICMR's approval, the state government placed an independent order to purchase around one lakh serology-based rapid test kits from China, that can return quick results and are expected to be used for mass testing in smaller towns and rural areas.[130][119] They were expected to be delivered by 9 April.[131] On 11 April, the Chief Secretary K Shanmugam said that the consignment meant for India was reportedly diverted to the United States, causing delay.[132] The delay affected the testing rate of the state. The director of public health K Kolandaswamy said \"It is admittedly one of our biggest weakness, but we decided there is no point in waiting for the kits. We have to use every minute in this period resourcefully.\" Instead of waiting, the health department has decided to use the existing RT-PCR kits for mass screening.[133] After several delays, 24,000 rapid test kits reached Chennai on 17 April.[134] The state aims to use it for initial testing of close contacts of people who have tested positive and in areas around the containment zones.[135] If tested positive, their samples are sent for a confirmatory PCR test.[134] The state had also ordered an additional 5 lakh rapid test kits and 1 lakh RT-PCR kits.[135][136] In late-April, the state returned the 24,000 rapid test kits that it had purchased from the Chinese firm Guangzhou Wondfo after ICMR's advise.[137] Chief Minister E Palaniswami had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide COVID-19 rapid test kits and \u20b91,000 crore (US$130 million) immediately to procure medical supplies in a video-conference chaired by Modi and attended by the Chief Ministers of other states on 11 April.[138] By June, the central government had provided 50,000 testing kits the state. Initially, the state only had four government labs for conducting tests for the coronavirus.[113] As of 20 June 2020, the state had 85 laboratories (45 government and 40 private) approved by ICMR for testing.[139] According to reports, private labs has fixed a rate of Rs 4,500 for testing a COVID-19 sample. The state government had announced that it will bear all the expenses.[140] In late March 2020, two researchers from the University of Cambridge came up with a new mathematical model that predicts a flat 49-day countrywide lockdown or sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation extending over two months may be necessary to prevent COVID-19 resurgence in India.[141] In June 2020, epidemiologists at Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University projected that Chennai may witness 150,000 infections and up to 1,600 deaths by the second week of July at the current rate of growth. The team also predicted that the state may record 130,000 infections and 769 deaths by 30 June 2020.[142] Epidemiologists have also advised the government that herd immunity in Tamil Nadu is possible only if 55\u201360% of the population contracts a mild infection. An official said, \"It means there will be many more cases and the idea is to keep the spread slow so that it can happen over many months to ensure that our health infrastructure is sufficient.\"[143] COVID-19 patients in the state are treated in four categories of facilities \u2014 severe cases require hospitalisation, moderate cases are admitted to 'health centres' and mild cases are accommodated at 'care centres'. The remaining asymptomatic cases are required to remain in home quarantine. According to a health official, about ten percent of the total active patients in the state need hospitalisation, about 20% need health centres, another 50% need care centres and the rest can go under home quarantine. He also added, \"On an average, a patient with severe symptoms requires a bed for about 10 days. This means that a bed will be occupied for 10 days.\"[143] The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) by Health & Family Welfare Department guides the medical staff in the clinical assessment of suspected COVID-19 patients. Any patient arriving with a fever, cough and difficulty in breathing is screened to determine if they are a suspect for COVID-19. A suspect case is one of the following:[144] Once a patient is suspected of COVID-19, their pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation are checked and their samples are collected for testing.[145] The guideline defines mild and moderate-severe as follows:[145] Mild cases are admitted to standard isolation while moderate to severe are taken to critical care unit (CCU) regardless of the test result. If the results arrive positive, they are treated as per the SOP.[145] The contacts of the confirmed COVID-19 patients are identified and isolated.[146][144] A contact is someone who had either provided direct care without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) for a COVID-19 patient; stayed in the same close environment of a COVID-19 patient (including workplace, classroom, household, gatherings) or travelled in close proximity (1 m) with a symptomatic person who later tested positive for COVID-19.[146] The contacts are classified into two based on the following:[146] High risk-contacts are tested within 5\u201314 days of coming into contact. Others undergo testing if they develop symptoms. If they don't develop symptoms, they are cleared to leave isolation after 28 days.[146] Drugs are given only after confirmation of the lab tests. The drugs used in the treatment of mild COVID-19 cases are Paracetamol, Oseltamavir 150 mg and antibiotics if needed. Their vitals are monitored twice a day.[145] For moderate to severe COVID-19 cases in CCUs, the following drugs are used:[145] Patient's vitals are monitored closely. They are also given a nutritious diet and mental health counseling. If their condition worsens, they are shifted to intensive care unit. A patient is discharged once they are clinically stable and two of their samples taken 24 hours apart test negative.[145] The state has 3,371 ventilators and 29,074 beds in isolation wards according to the Department of Health and Family Welfare as of April 2.[147] It has ordered an additional 2,571 ventilators.[136] The number of hospital beds available is 1.1 per 1000 population and 7.8 per 1000 for elderly population according to a Brookings report.[148] As of 2 April, 21 government facilities are designated for treating COVID-19 illness cost free. As of 3 April, 25 private colleges and 110 private hospitals in the state are designated for treating COVID-19 illness.[149][150] As of 15 June 2020, officials said that the state can accommodate about one lakh moderately or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in schools and colleges. Government has also begun identifying more public spaces to create care facilities across the state.[143] The Chennai Trade Center in Nandambakkam was converted into a 550-bed COVID-19 quarantine ward on April 14.[120][151] As many as 747 marriage halls and 50 schools were identified in Chennai to be converted as COVID-19 care centres.[71][152] The Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash said that the city plans to create 50,000 bed spaces to treat asymptomatic COVID-19 patients while adding that more than 98% of the cases in Chennai were asymptomatic. These milder cases will be sent to the care centres instead of a government hospital with intensive care.[153] As of 4 May 2020, there were 4,000 such beds in Chennai at care centres and the Communicable Diseases Hospital in Tondiarpet.[152] By 2 June, Chennai alone had 17,500 beds for COVID-19 care. The whole state had 75,000 beds.[123] On 7 June, the state government capped the COVID-19 treatment fees charged by private hospitals in the state. According to the issued guidelines, the maximum allowable daily treatment charges in higher grade (A1 and A2) hospitals were \u20b97,500 and \u20b915,000 for general and ICU wards respectively. In lower grade hospitals (A3 and A4), they were \u20b95,000 and \u20b915,000.[154] On 17 June, a 400-bed COVID-19 care facility of Christian Medical College was opened in Kannigapuram, Ranipet.[155] The state government was among the first to launch measures against COVID-19.[156] On 30 January, it had put 78 people who arrived from China under quarantine.[156] The state government had announced a \u20b93,280 crore (US$410 million) relief package on 24 March. It included financial support of \u20b91,000 (US$13) to all ration card holders, free rice and other essential commodities in the wake of lockdown. It also provided registered street vendors, autorickshaw drivers, migrant labourers and construction workers in the state with similar provisions.[157] It had also announced extension periods of three months to make loan and tax payments for all citizens, and one month to pay house rent for workers including migrants across the state.[158][159] Currently, the government operates 311 relief camps and shelters for migrant workers.[160][29] Earlier, it had allocated sum of \u20b960 crore (US$7.5 million) from disaster relief fund to deal with the crisis.
