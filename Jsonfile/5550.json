{"Content: ":"The Weekly Democratic Address is delivered by a different prominent Democrat each week, in response to the Weekly Address of the President of the United States during a Republican presidency. When a Democrat has held the Presidency, the President delivers the weekly address, such as occurred during 2009-2017 under Barack Obama. Republican President George W. Bush was inaugurated on January 20. While Democrats held a majority in the Senate until Inauguration Day, Republicans received a majority of seats in both the House and Senate following the inauguration. Democratic Nominee Barack Obama was elected president while the Democrats hold majorities in Both Houses. After the Election, Barack Obama gives out weekly addresses on the behalf of all Democrats. When Barack Obama was inaugurated as President, Democrats returned to having Weekly Addresses by the President while Republicans began the use of Weekly Responses. Democrats would later return to the Weekly Address format on January 21, 2017 with the inauguration of Donald Trump. Republican President Donald Trump was inaugurated on January 20, and Republicans currently hold majorities in both houses of Congress. For the first time, the Democrats, as the Opposition, will begin and continue using video addresses in addition to its usual Radio Address that the Democrats made in the Bush Administration. The Republicans also did weekly video addresses during the Obama Administration. President Trump discontinued his Weekly Addresses in August 2018, although the Democrats continued their weekly addresses since then. 5 8 As of July 2019, President Trump has not issued a weekly address.","Title":"Weekly Democratic Address - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5550","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Democratic_Address"}
