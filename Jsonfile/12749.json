K. Illangakoon in April 2016.[6][7] Jayasundara was asked to resign by President Maithripala Sirisena, but has refused and has been put on compulsory leave in the wake of the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings debacle, Senior DIG C. D. Wickramaratne has been appointed as acting Inspector General.[8][9] The Inspector General of Police can be removed through an investigation by a 3-member committee if found guilty of specified offence(s) under the Removal of Officers (Procedure) Act No. 5 of 2002.[9]","Title":"Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12749","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_General_of_Police_(Sri_Lanka)"}
