It is based on market capitalisation. Weighting of shares is conducted in proportion to the issued ordinary capital of the listed companies, valued at current market price (i.e. market capitalisation). The base year is 1985, and the base value of the index is 100. This is the longest and the broadest measure of the Sri Lankan Stock market.
