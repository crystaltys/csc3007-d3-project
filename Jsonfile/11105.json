Some countries issue digital records while others issue paper records. In some European Union member states, citizens might choose to have a digital record, a piece of paper, or both.[1] In Australia, vaccine providers are required to report to the Australian Immunisation Register no later than 10 days after a vaccination is given.

Prior to this, QR health codes were required for public transport and access to public spaces in the country. The platform also allows for digital contact tracing and shows a green code for users who have not been in contact with infected people. The system has sparked concerns over government surveillance and privacy of users.[11][12][13] Those who have received two doses of a vaccine receive a certificate that allows them to travel.[14] Vaccinated users can either receive a vaccine card or register online after receiving both doses to get a certificate.

A vaccinated person has to either download the app or use the website to download the certificate. A QR Code is provided to allow the pass to be verified.
