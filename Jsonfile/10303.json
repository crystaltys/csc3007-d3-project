{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Equatorial Guinea is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Equatorial Guinea on 14 March 2020.[2] Equatorial Guinea has a weak healthcare system, leaving it vulnerable to an outbreak.[3] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[4][5] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[6][7] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[8][6] Model-based simulations for Equatorial Guinea suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t has been stable around 1.0 since October 2020.[9] The Africa Oil & Investment Forum was postponed.[46] The Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons waived fees for service companies in order to alleviate the economic fallout from the pandemic.[47]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Equatorial Guinea - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10303","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Equatorial_Guinea"}
