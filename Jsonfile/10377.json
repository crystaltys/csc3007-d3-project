{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The first case of the virus in Sri Lanka was confirmed on 27 January 2020, after a 44-year-old Chinese woman from Hubei, China, was admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda, Sri Lanka.[3] As of 1 September 2021, a total of 462,767 COVID-19 cases had been recorded in the country, 386,509 patients had recovered from the disease, and 10,140 patients had died.[4][5] The first reported case involving a Sri Lankan outside the country was reported in Italy on 3 March 2020. As of 23 March 2020, forty-five quarantine centres had been built in the country by the Sri Lanka Army as a preventative measure in an attempt to stop the spread of the pandemic.[6] Nearly 3,500 people were placed under quarantine in 45 quarantine centres, including 31 foreigners from 14 countries.[7] As of 25 March 2020, Sri Lankan authorities tracked down over 14,000 people who had come into contact with identified patients, and ordered those people to self-quarantine.[8] As of 16 April 2020, Sri Lanka was named the 16th highest-risk country for contracting the virus.[9] In April 2020, Sri Lanka's response to the pandemic was ranked as the 9th best in the world.[10] Although Sri Lanka was successful in handling the first wave of the pandemic, the government's failure to handle the second and the third waves of the pandemic have caused a spike in COVID-19 deaths since November 2020. There was a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases after the relaxation of health restrictions during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year in April 2021. The highly contagious Delta variant has been responsible for the considerably high fatality rate in the country since August 2021. As of August 2021, Sri Lanka became the country with the fourth-largest number of daily deaths in the world by population just behind Georgia, Tunisia, and Malaysia.[11] Government negligence in implementing a lockdown, negligent behaviour of the general public, and teachers' protests have all contributed to the record spike of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country.[12] On 20 August 2021, government imposed a ten-day lockdown island-wide to curb the spread of COVID-19 cases.[13][14] The decision to lockdown the country came following the immense pressure from the health authorities and the political parties who demanded complete lockdown after Sri Lanka surpassed 1,000 deaths over the course of eight days.[15][16][17] It is believed that the COVID-19 cases in the country are underreported by the officials and allegations regarding the manipulation of details regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the country were also raised.[18][19] Some businesses imposed a voluntary lockdown for a period of 10 to 14 days during the early parts of August when the government refused to impose a lockdown due to the worsening situation of the economy.[20] The Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised interest rates in August 2021, and Sri Lanka became the first nation in Asia to tighten the monetary policy during the pandemic era.[21][22] On 27 August 2021, the government extended the lockdown to 6 September 2021 as the daily death toll surpassed 200 for the first time since the pandemic began.[23][24]  Notes:  On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This illness had been reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[25][26] While the case fatality ratio for COVID-19[27][28] has been much lower than the SARS outbreak in 2003, its transmission rate of the virus is significantly greater with a significant total death toll.[29][27] Quarantine law in Sri Lanka is governed by the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance No 3 of 1897.[30] Prior to 27 January, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health had instructed staff at Bandaranaike International Airport to screen passengers for symptoms. Additionally, the ministry issued a recommendation that infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people who suffer from chronic diseases should avoid visiting crowded places when possible.[31] The Ministry of Health set up a 22-member National Action Committee to help limit the spread of the virus.[32] The Department of Immigration and Emigration informed all construction sites with Chinese resident visa holders to restrict their Chinese employees to their respective workplaces and lodgings.[33] On 27 January, the first confirmed case of the virus was reported in Sri Lanka, a 44-year-old Chinese woman from Hubei Province in China.[3] She had arrived as a tourist with another group of travellers and had been screened at the Bandaranaike International Airport after having a high fever. She fully recovered and was released from the hospital on 19 February.[34] Following the first reported case of COVID-19, demand for face masks in the country increased and the country began to face a mask shortage.[35] Some pharmacies in the country had sold all their face masks and there were reports from customers that face masks were being sold at over 10 to 20 times the original price;[35] as a result, the country's drug regulatory agency placed price controls on face masks.[35][needs update] 33 Sri Lankan students and families were evacuated from Wuhan on 1 February and quarantined at a military facility at Diyatalawa.[36] They were released after two weeks on 14 February.[37] Since the first week of March, visitors from Italy, Iran, and South Korea have been required to quarantine for two weeks at one of two facilities. On 10 March 186 people (164 Sri Lankan nationals, 20 Italian nationals, and 2 South Korean nationals) were placed under quarantine in Batticaloa.[38] On the same day, two Sri Lankans living in the United Arab Emirates had contracted COVID-19.[citation needed] On 10 March, the first case of COVID-19 in a Sri Lankan citizen, a 52-year-old tour guide working with a group of Italians, was reported.[39] After testing positive, he was brought to the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Angoda for treatment.[40] 29 patients received treatment in government hospitals, including eight foreigners.[41] Sri Lanka suspended all on-arrival visas for tourists on 11 March.[42][43] On 12 March, another Sri Lankan citizen tested positive for COVID-19,[44] a 44-year-old person, who had reportedly stayed with the first Sri Lankan patient diagnosed with the virus.[45] On 13 March, three more patients tested positive for the virus in Sri Lanka. One of them was a 41-year-old Sri Lankan male who had arrived from Germany, and was admitted to the IDH in Angoda. The other two patients were from a group of people who had been quarantined at a facility in Kandakadu. One was a 37-year-old who had arrived from Italy, and was treated at the Polonnaruwa Hospital, Polonnaruwa. The other was a 43-year-old male who had also arrived from Italy, and he was sent to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Angoda.[46] On 14 March, five patients tested positive for COVID-19 in Sri Lanka; four of them returned from Italy.[47] It was also reported that one of the co-pilots of Sri Lankan Airlines became infected with the coronavirus and attended the annual Royal\u2013Thomian Big Match between S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, and the Royal College, Colombo.[48] On 15 March, seven people tested positive, making the overall case count 18. The surge of new cases caused the government to declare 16 March a public holiday, which was extended to 19 March.[49] On 16 March, 10 more people tested positive for a total of 28,[50][51] and on 17 March, another 15 people tested positive, increasing the total to 43.[52] On 17 March, the secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Kamal Gunaratne revealed that around 170 passengers who returned from Italy and South Korea had skipped the quarantine procedure.[53] On 18 March, two people fully recovered from the disease while seven people tested positive, bringing the total case count to 50.[54] On 19 March, nine more people tested positive, bumping the total case count to 59.
