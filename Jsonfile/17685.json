{"Content: ":"Patrick Henry \"Adam\" Wade (March 17, 1935 \u2013 July 7, 2022)[1] was an American singer, musician, and actor. Wade was perhaps most known for his stint as the host of the CBS game show Musical Chairs (1975), making him the first Black game show host in the United States.[2] Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States,[2] to Pauline Simpson and Henry Oliver Wade, Jr., Wade was raised by his grandparents. Wade grew up in the East Liberty neighborhood and attended Westinghouse High School; graduating in 1952. After high school, Wade attended Virginia State University but dropped out in his sophomore year.[3] After working for a time as a lab assistant with Dr. Jonas Salk on the polio research team,[4] Wade began to pursue a recording career, signing with Coed Records in late 1959. He had his first hit in early 1960 (No. 58) with the song \"Ruby\",[5] a cover of the hit movie song of 1953.[6] Wade was popular in the early-1960s.[7] In 1961 three of his recordings (\"Take Good Care of Her\" (No. 7), \"As If I Didn't Know\" (No. 10) and \"The Writing on the Wall\" (No. 5)) made the Top Ten in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[2] These songs also made the Top Five of Billboard's Easy Listening survey. Wade released the following albums in the United Kingdom: Adam and Evening in 1961 and Adam Wade One Is A Lonely Number in 1962. Wade also released an EP in 1960, And Then Came Adam. \"Take Good Care of Her\" reached No. 38 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1961.[8] Wade's vocal style was generally compared to that of his contemporary Johnny Mathis.[2] But it was actually a singer from an earlier period, Nat King Cole, who was his principal influence.[2] In a Connecticut Public Radio interview, Wade said: \"My father introduced me to Nat\u2019s music when I was a kid. He was my idol since high school.\"[9] In 1975, Wade became the first African-American to host a television game show, with the premiere of Musical Chairs.[2] He starred in a stage production of Guys and Dolls in 1978, and hosted the talk show Mid-Morning LA.[10] In 1979, he co-starred with Della Reese in a production of Same Time, Next Year.[11] On TV he was seen in the soap operas The Guiding Light and Search for Tomorrow, and was a familiar presence on such popular black-oriented sitcoms as Sanford & Son, The Jeffersons, What's Happening!! and Good Times. His handsome face lit up the room and allowed his natural mannerism to take over the scene. In the late\u20131970s and early\u20131980s Wade began to concentrate on acting, and appeared in several of the so-called blaxploitation movies, including Gordon's War. Wade briefly returned to recording, producing a self\u2013titled album on the Kirschner record label, which was distributed by Columbia Records. This was a venture into a more soulful singing genre. It met with moderate success but is still a favorite with his loyal fans. He appeared in one episode of The Dukes of Hazzard. His latest theatrical appearance was with the 2008 touring company of the play The Color Purple. Wade and his wife have a music production firm, Songbird, whose headquarters are in New Jersey. A resident of Montclair, New Jersey following his marriage in 1989, Wade died there on July 7, 2022, at age 87.[12] He had battled Parkinson\u2019s disease.[13] Wade was married twice and had three children. Wade's first marriage was to his high school sweetheart Kay A. Wade from 1956 until 1973. Together, they had three children; Sheldon (Ramel) Wade, Patrice Johnson Wade and Michael (Jamel) Wade. Wade was married to Jeree Wade in 1989, and their marriage lasted until his death. The two often performed together, and Wade revealed in an interview that he met Jeree on the set of Musical Chairs.","Title":"Adam Wade (singer) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17685","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Wade_(singer)"}
