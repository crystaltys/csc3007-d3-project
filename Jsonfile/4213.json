{"Content: ":"Anton Joseph Cermak (Czech: Antonín Josef Čermák, pronounced [ˈantoɲiːn ˈjozɛf ˈtʃɛrmaːk]; May 9, 1873 \u2013 March 6, 1933) was an American politician who served as the 44th[1] mayor of Chicago, Illinois from April 7, 1931 until his death on March 6, 1933. He was killed by an assassin, whose likely target was President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the assassin shot Cermak instead after a bystander hit the assassin with a purse. Cermak was born to a mining family in Kladno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), the son of Antonín Čermák and Kateřina née Frank(ová).[2][3][4] He emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1874, and grew up in the town of Braidwood, Illinois, where he was educated before beginning to work full time while still a teenager.[5] He followed his father into coal mining, and labored at mines in Will and Grundy counties.[6] After moving to Chicago at age 16, Cermak worked as a tow boy for the horse-drawn streetcar line,[7][a] and then tended horses in the stables of Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood.[6] During the early years of his working life, Cermak supplemented his education with evening high school and business college classes.[8] After saving enough money to buy his own horse and cart, he went into business selling firewood, and he subsequently expanded his venture into a haulage business.[8] As he became more politically active, Cermak served in municipal government jobs, including as a clerk in the city police court, and as a bailiff for the Municipal Court of Chicago.[9][10] As his political fortunes began to rise, Cermak was able to avail himself of other business opportunities, including interests in real estate, insurance, and banking.[8] He began his political career as a Democratic Party precinct captain, and in 1902, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. Seven years later, he became alderman of the 12th Ward (serving two terms: one from 1909 through 1912, and another from 1919 through 1922).[11] Cermak was elected President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1922, chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party in 1928, and mayor of Chicago in 1931.[12] In 1928, he ran for the United States Senate, but was defeated by Republican Otis F. Glenn, after Cermak received only 46% of the vote. Cermak's mayoral victory came in the wake of the Great Depression, the deep resentment many Chicagoans had of Prohibition, and the increasing violence resulting from organized crime's control of Chicago\u2014typified by the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.[citation needed] The many ethnic groups, such as Czechs, Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Italians, and African Americans, that began to settle in Chicago in the early 1900s were mostly detached from the political system, due in part to a lack of organization, which led to underrepresentation in the City Council. As an immigrant himself, Cermak recognized Chicago\u2019s relatively new immigrants as a significant population of disenfranchised voters, which had the potential to be a large power base for Cermak and his local Democratic organization.[citation needed] Before Cermak, the Democratic party in Cook County was run by Irish Americans. The Irish first became successful in politics since they spoke English, and because, coming from an island on the edge of Europe, they had few ancestral enemies. As the old saying went: \u201cA Lithuanian won\u2019t vote for a Pole, and a Pole won\u2019t vote for a Lithuanian. A German won\u2019t vote for either of them. But all three will vote for a turkey\u2014an Irishman.\u201d[13] As Cermak climbed the local political ladder, the resentment of the party leadership grew. When the bosses rejected his bid to become the mayoral candidate, Cermak swore revenge. He formed his political army from the non-Irish elements, and even persuaded the black politician, William L. Dawson, to switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party.[citation needed] Dawson later became a U.S. Representative (from the 1st District), and soon the most powerful black politician in Illinois.[14] Cermak\u2019s political and organizational skills helped create one of the most influential political organizations of his day. With support from Franklin D. Roosevelt on the national level, Cermak gradually wooed members of Chicago\u2019s growing black community into the Democratic fold. Walter Wright, the superintendent of parks and aviation for the city of Chicago, aided Cermak in stepping into office.[citation needed] When Cermak challenged the incumbent, William \u201cBig Bill\u201d Hale Thompson, in the 1931 mayor's race, Thompson, who represented Chicago's existing Irish-dominated power structure, responded with ethnic slurs: Cermak replied, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like my name\u2026 it\u2019s true I didn\u2019t come over on the Mayflower, but I came over as soon as I could.\u201d It was a sentiment to which ethnic Chicagoans could relate, and Thompson\u2019s prejudicial insults largely backfired.[15][16] Thompson\u2019s reputation as a buffoon, many voters\u2019 disgust with the corruption of his political machine, and his inability or unwillingness to clean up organized crime in Chicago were cited as major factors in Cermak capturing 58% of the vote in the mayoral election on April 6, 1931. Cermak\u2019s victory finished Thompson as a political power, and largely ended the Republican Party's influence in Chicago; indeed, all the mayors of Chicago since 1931 have been members of the Democratic Party. For nearly his entire administration, Cermak had to deal with a major tax revolt. From 1931 to 1933, the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers mounted a \u201ctax strike.\u201d[17] At its height, the association, which was headed by John M. Pratt and James E. Bistor, had over 30,000 members. Much to Cermak\u2019s dismay, it successfully slowed down the collection of real estate taxes through litigation and the promotion of the refusal to pay. In the meantime, the city found it difficult to pay teachers and maintain services. Cermak had to meet President-elect Roosevelt to \u201cmend fences,\u201d and to request money to fund essential city services.[citation needed] On February 15, 1933, while shaking hands with President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt at Bayfront Park in Miami, Florida, Cermak was shot in the lung and mortally wounded by Giuseppe Zangara, who was attempting to assassinate Roosevelt. At the critical moment, Lillian Cross, a woman standing near Zangara, hit Zangara's arm with her purse, and spoiled his aim.[18] In addition to Cermak, Zangara hit four other people: Margaret Kruis, 21, of Newark, NJ, shot through the hand; Russell Caldwell, 22, of Miami, hit squarely in the forehead by a spent bullet, which embedded itself under the skin; Mabel Gill of Miami, shot in the abdomen; and William Sinnott, a New York police detective, who received a glancing blow to the forehead and scalp.[19] All four of those injuries were minor. Once at the hospital, Cermak reportedly uttered the line that was engraved on his tomb, saying to Roosevelt, \u201cI\u2019m glad it was me, not you.\u201d The Chicago Tribune reported the quote without attributing it to a witness, and most scholars doubt that it was ever said.[20] Zangara told the police that he hated rich and powerful people, but not Roosevelt personally.[21] Later, rumors circulated that Cermak, not Roosevelt, had been the intended target, as his promise to clean up Chicago\u2019s rampant lawlessness posed a threat to Al Capone and the Chicago organized crime syndicate.[22][23] One of the first people to suggest the organized crime theory was reporter Walter Winchell, who happened to be in Miami the evening of the shooting.[24][25] According to Roosevelt biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no proof for this theory.[26] Long-time Chicago newsman Len O\u2019Connor offers a different view of the events surrounding the mayor\u2019s assassination. He has written that aldermen Paddy Bauler and Charlie Weber informed him that relations between Cermak and Roosevelt were strained, because Cermak fought Roosevelt\u2019s nomination at the Democratic convention in Chicago.[27] Author Ronald Humble provides yet another perspective as to why Cermak was killed. In his book Frank Nitti: The True Story of Chicago\u2019s Notorious Enforcer, Humble contends that Cermak was as corrupt as Thompson, and that the Chicago Outfit hired Zangara to kill Cermak in retaliation for Cermak\u2019s attempt to murder Frank Nitti.[citation needed] Cermak died at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami[28] on March 6, partly due to his wounds. On March 30, however, his personal physician, Dr. Karl A. Meyer, revealed that the primary cause of Cermak\u2019s death was ulcerative colitis, commenting, \u201cThe mayor would have recovered from the bullet wound had it not been for the complication of colitis. The autopsy disclosed the wound had healed ... the other complications were not directly due to the bullet wound.\u201d[29] Zangara was convicted of murder after Cermak\u2019s death, and was executed in Florida's electric chair on March 20, 1933.[30] Cermak was interred in a mausoleum at the Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago. The mayor\u2019s death was followed by a struggle for succession both to his party chairmanship, and for the mayor's office.[31] A plaque honoring Cermak still lies at the site of the assassination in Miami\u2019s Bayfront Park. It is inscribed with Cermak\u2019s alleged words to Roosevelt after he was shot, \u201cI\u2019m glad it was me instead of you.\u201d Following Cermak\u2019s death, 22nd Street\u2014a major east\u2013west artery that traversed Chicago\u2019s West Side, and the close-in suburbs of Cicero and Berwyn, areas with significant Czech populations\u2014was renamed Cermak Road. In 1943, a Liberty ship, the SS A. J. Cermak was named in Cermak\u2019s honor. It was scrapped in 1964.[citation needed] Cermak\u2019s son-in-law, Otto Kerner Jr., served as the 33rd Governor of Illinois, and as a federal circuit judge. His grandson, Frank J. Jirka, Jr., who was with him in Miami when he was assassinated, later became an Underwater Demolition Team officer in the United States Navy. Jirka was awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his actions during the Battle of Iwo Jima; the wounds he suffered led to the amputation of both legs below the knee. After World War II, he became a physician, and in 1983, was elected president of the American Medical Association. Cermak\u2019s great niece, Kajon Cermak, is a radio broadcaster.[32] His daughter, Lillian, was married to Richey V. Graham, who served in the Illinois General Assembly.[33]","Title":"Anton Cermak - Wikipedia","KeyID":"4213","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Cermak"}
