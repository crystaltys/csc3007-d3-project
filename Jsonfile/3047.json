{"Content: ":"Teenage Dream is the third studio album by American singer Katy Perry.[1] It was released on August 24, 2010, through Capitol Records. Primarily a pop record,[1] Teenage Dream also contains elements of disco, electronic, rock, funk, house, Hi-NRG, and hip hop, that revolve around young love, partying, self-empowerment, and personal growth. Perry co-wrote the album, and worked with a number of producers such as Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco, Stargate and Greg Wells. With \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", Teenage Dream is the second album in history to have five number-one singles (after Michael Jackson's 1987 album Bad) to top the US Billboard Hot 100, and the first by a woman to achieve this milestone. Its sixth single, \"The One That Got Away\", peaked at number three on that chart. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 192,000 copies in its first week. The album was certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined album sales, track sales, on-demand audio and video streams equivalent of nine million album-sale units. The album has gone onto sell 3.1 million copies in the United States, and charted within the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 year-end chart three years in a row.[2] The album also sold 1.3 million copies in the United Kingdom, where it was certified four times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Upon its release, Teenage Dream received mostly mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented its production, themes, and Perry's vocals while critiquing other aspects. However, the album has retrospectively received critical acclaim, landing on multiple decade-end best album lists and is often seen as one of the best pop albums recorded.[3] Billboard named Teenage Dream \"one of the defining LPs from a new golden age in mega-pop\" and The A.V. Club called the album \"pop perfection\".[4][5] The album and its singles earned Perry seven Grammy Award nominations including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Record of the Year. It also won International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2011. All six of the aforementioned singles, in addition to two from its 2012 reissue Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, have sold over two million digital downloads each in the US, setting a record in the digital era for the most multi-Platinum singles from one album, breaking the previous record of Fergie's debut album The Dutchess (2006), which had five multi-Platinum songs.[6] To promote the album, Perry embarked on the California Dreams Tour from 2011 to 2012.[7] By July 2013, Teenage Dream had sold 6 million copies worldwide. Prior to recording Teenage Dream, Perry told Rolling Stone she would \"definitely keep it pop\", in order to not \"alienate\" her fanbase.[8] Perry began recording the album on October 13, 2009, stating that she had \"lots of layers to get through, thankfully Greg Wells is there to do the peeling\".[9] Work on the album involved collaborating with numerous artists and producers including Wells. Guy Sigsworth, Dr. Luke, Max Martin,[10][11] Ryan Tedder,[12] Rivers Cuomo,[11] Kuk Harrell,[13] Greg Kurstin, Benny Blanco, Darkchild, Cathy Dennis, Esther Dean, and Tricky Stewart, who told Rap-Up magazine in December 2009 that the sound of the album would be pop and rock, like One of the Boys, though calling it a \"different gear\" for himself.[14] As for the visual component, Perry likens it to \"going from Shirley Temple, Betty Boop to more of a Betty Paige [sic], pop art-sarcastic-fun-Lichtenstein picture: still bright, but the colors are more saturated, and it's more metallic fuchsia or purple than bubblegum pink.\"[15] On March 27, 2010, at 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, Perry told Jose Ordonez that she considered the album \"a summer record\". She added that her previous teases about the album still fit, saying \"it's what I said I wanted earlier\".[11] She has also stated that the album is inspired by ABBA and the Cardigans. According to Perry, she gave her producer Dr. Luke a mixtape of songs by the two groups in order to demonstrate how she wanted her next record to sound. Perry described the album as \"more groove-driven\". She added, \"When I went on tour, as much as I love all the in-between songs, I felt I was missing some of the stuff that made people bounce up and down.\"[16] During a Rolling Stone photo shoot in April 2010, Perry revealed details about what would be the album's lead single, \"California Gurls\". Allegedly a response to Jay-Z and Alicia Keys's \"Empire State of Mind\", she stated \"everyone has the New York song, but what the fuck? What about LA? What about California?\", adding that the song also took its inspiration from Prince.[17] The song features California rapper Snoop Dogg. USA Today gave the song a positive review, calling it \"an effervescent toast to summer fun\".[18] Perry also claimed that working with producers Max Martin and Dr. Luke was \"a wonderful collaborative effort\".[17] For the recording of Teenage Dream, Perry had recorded at a multitude of recording studios such as Playback Recording Studio, Roc the Mic Studios, Conway Recording Studios, Rocket Carousel Studio, Studio at the Palms, Triangle Sound Studios, Silent Sound Studios, The Boom Boom Boom, Henson Recording Studios, Capitol Studios, NightBird Recording Studios, and Eightysevenfourteen Studios.[19] Recording for the album finished on April 30, 2010. The album cover is a painting by Will Cotton, and was revealed on July 21, 2010.[20] via a live webstream with Cotton, at his Art Studio.[21] On July 23, 2010, the album's official track listing was posted on Perry's official website.[22] Perry stated about the album \"You're getting the sugary sweet but you're also getting the 'Oh my goodness, she had to sit down for a minute and let things off her chest'\".[23] The music of Teenage Dream is derived from a wide variety of pop genres, while heavily incorporating different musical styles not heard on her previous releases; disco and electronic are examples.[1] Musically, Teenage Dream is considered to be a departure from Perry's previous album, One of the Boys (2008), which was pop rock and soft rock driven. The album features a very wide range of rock subgenres, which include disco rock,[24] glam metal,[25] indie rock,[26] pop rock,[27] hard rock,[28] electronic rock,[29] and goth rock.[30] The album opens with the title track and second single \"Teenage Dream\", which is written as a throwback record to Perry's teenage years.[31] It is a power pop and electropop song which features a \"distinct retro sound\",[32][33][34] and contains influences of disco, pop rock, and industrial music.[27][35][36] The song has been compared to several disco artists, including Madonna and the Cardigans.[37] The second song is \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", the song recalls a true experience that Perry had while partying in Santa Barbara which included streaking in a park, dancing on tables, and partying at a club.[38] Musically, the song is styled in the genres of disco, indie rock, and Hi-NRG,[26][39][40] while also taking influence from dance-pop.[41] The lead single, \"California Gurls\", continues the \"retro sound\" carried from \"Teenage Dream\", and is written as an answer song to \"Empire State of Mind\" by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, and pays tribute to the beach lifestyle of California.[32][42] The song utilizes the genres of disco, funk-pop, and electropop,[24][25][43] while bearing influence of new wave music within its composition.[25][35][44] The fourth track is the self-empowerment song \"Firework\". Written in a disco-rock style which runs over the backing track, consisting of a mix of violins and house music.[24][45][46] The song has generated comparisons to artists such as Coldplay and Leona Lewis.[37][47] According to Perry, the song was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, and she has said on many occasions that it is her favorite song from the album.[48][49] \"Peacock\" is a dance-pop song, with an up-tempo house music beat.[24] Lyrically, the track contains a double entendre with suggestive wording. New York magazine writer Willa Paskin observed that Perry did the obvious with the song's hook (\"she used a common word for penis and made it mean penis!\").[50] Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone thought of \"Peacock\" as a sequel to Gwen Stefani's 2005 single \"Hollaback Girl\" by noticing the two songs shared a drum hook.[51] The album follows with \"Circle the Drain\", a disco-rock song where, lyrically, Perry is telling off a self-destructive drug-addicted ex-boyfriend. Its candid lyrics[52][53] also discuss the strains his addiction put on both of them. In the track's chorus, she sings about how she wants to be his lover, not someone who has to take care of him, such as a maternal figure. She also sings about how he had ultimately lost large opportunities.[52] The song is styled in the genres of disco-rock,[24] and gothic rock tones.[30] The sixth single from Teenage Dream is \"The One That Got Away\", which is a rock and pop ballad.[54] Perry stated that she wrote the song \"about when you promise someone forever, but you end up not being able to follow through. It's a bittersweet story. Hopefully, the listener learns from hearing it and never has to say they had 'the one' get away.\"[55] The eighth song, \"E.T.\" is a song about \"falling in love with a foreigner\".[56] A remix of the song features Kanye West. Musically, the track is an electronic and hip hop ballad influenced by drum and bass, rave, and techno. The eleventh track, \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\", was inspired by Perry's boyfriend at the time, Russell Brand.[57] Musically, it is a 1980s-styled hard rock song that contains a mixture of elements from rock and electronica. Lyrically, the song compares the feeling of being in love to the speed of a hummingbird's heartbeat.[58][59] The last track is \"Not Like the Movies\" a power ballad about a love relationship where a woman does not feel in love and still waits for the man of her dreams, or \"charming prince\", as a Terra reviewer put it.[60] Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' \"Everytime\" (2003) and Evanescence's \"My Immortal\" (2003).[61] \"Teenage Dream\" was released on August 24, 2010, in the United States[62] as a digital download on iTunes, and as a physical release by Capitol Records.[63] Worldwide, the album was released on August 30, 2010 and distributed by EMI.[64] A deluxe version was made available on August 27, 2010 in the US, and consists of two CDs with the twelve original tracks, plus two tracks from 2009 on which Perry had appeared as a featured artist \u2014 3OH!3's \"Starstrukk\" and Timbaland's \"If We Ever Meet Again\".[65] The deluxe version also includes remixes of \"California Gurls\" and \"Teenage Dream\". In North America, the album was packaged in several different ways. The explicit version of the album is available in a three-panel (six-sided) digipak, which does not feature Perry's name or the album title on the cover, aside from the Parental Advisory warning label on the lower right-hand corner. This is also how the album is displayed if purchased digitally. The booklet contained inside this version reproduces the album's front artwork, without any labels or text. The explicit version is also offered in a standard jewel case, which has text printed on the booklet and has the smell of cotton candy. The cover with text is mainly used for releases outside of North America, while international deluxe editions are available in the digipak, with a bonus disc included. A limited number of the albums are scented like cotton candy indicated by a sticker on the cover. Artwork based on the album were also used by Electronic Arts for the limited edition of the expansion pack The Sims 3: Showtime from The Sims game franchise. It was released on March 6, 2012.[66] The official album cover, which shows Perry lying naked on clouds of cotton candy, was painted on canvas by Will Cotton and released on July 21 via live webstream.[67] The covers of the first two singles were photographed by Emma Summerton in April 2010, and three other pictures taken by the artist were released to promote the album in July.[68] On June 14, 2010, a beach themed Teenage Dream listening party took place in New York, a number of tracks were played, including: \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"Last Friday Night\", \"Circle The Drain\", \"Pearl\", \"The One That Got Away\", \"Peacock\", and \"Not Like the Movies\".[69] Before the release of the album, three promotional singles were released exclusively on Apple's iTunes Store as a countdown to Teenage Dream. \"Not Like the Movies\", was released digitally on August 3, 2010,[70] and debuted at number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100.[71] \"Circle the Drain\" was released digitally on August 10, 2010 as the second promotional single,[72] and entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 58.[73] \"E.T.\", the third, was released the following week on August 17, 2010, and charted at number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100.[74] \"Peacock\" reached number 64 in Canada, number 52 in the Czech Republic,[75] and number 1 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart.[76] It has also sold over 500,000 copies in the US[77] and certified Gold on July 9, 2012. A dance remix of it was released on March 26, 2012.[78] Promotion for the album began with a live performance of the album's lead single, \"California Gurls\" on May 20, 2010, at the CW networks' annual \"upfronts\" presentation in New York.[79][80] Perry alongside Snoop Dogg performed \"California Gurls\" at the MTV Movie Awards in June 2010.[81] She also promoted the song that same month on Germany's Next Topmodel 2010 and Le Grand Journal.[82] The Candifornia theme from the \"California Gurls\" video was used in the song's performance at the MuchMusic Video Awards 2010 and on The Graham Norton Show.[83] On September 5, 2010, Perry performed \"Teenage Dream\", \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", \"Firework\" and \"Not Like the Movies\" in the show's launch of the Teenage Dream in Berlin. Perry performed \"Teenage Dream\" live for the first time in July 2010 in MTV World Stage Live in Malaysia, as well as opening the 2010 Teen Choice Awards with a rendition of it.[84] In August, Perry performed \"California Gurls\" and \"Peacock\" on The Morning Show and The Today Show.[85] That same month, \"Firework\" was performed live for the first time on the Late Show with David Letterman.[86] While promoting the album, Perry expressed she wanted her upcoming tour to be very visual. On her Twitter account, she stated, \"I hope that it's going to engage all of your senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch\".[87] The California Dreams Tour was officially announced in October 2010 by various media outlets including Perry's official website, in conjunction with the release of her third single, \"Firework\". In 2011, Perry announced her North American leg during a live chat on social network Facebook.

He criticized the production, calling it \"Frankenstein-like\", as well as calling Perry's vocals \"robotic\" and lacking \"any elegance or nuance\".[30] Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine called it \"over-produced bad-girl debauchery\", claiming that Perry has \"found a way to lower the bar\".[37] The Los Angeles Times gave it three stars, saying, \"On 'Teenage Dream,' the songs alternate between weekend-bender celebrations of hedonism and self-help-style affirmations encouraging listeners to get an emotional makeover. Either way, acquisition is the goal: of a great love, a happy hangover, a perfect pair of Daisy Dukes\". Leah Greenblatt, writing for Entertainment Weekly, stated, \"beneath the fruity outfits and fart jokes, Perry is clearly serious about the business of hit songcraft; that doesn't make Dream nearly cohesive as an album, but it does provide, intermittently, exactly the kind of high-fructose rush she's aiming for.\"[115] On the album's 10th anniversary, Patrick Gomez of The A.V. Club praised it as \"pop perfection\", writing that \"the magic of the album is that it remains cohesive\" and \"the heightened emotions of teen love, lust, and self-discovery remain a constant throughout\".[119] Best-of lists After its release, Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with a total of 192,000 copies sold in its first week.[138] In the week July 21, 2012, the album jumped from 21 to two on the chart (up 417% on sales) with sales of 80,000 copies, becoming best sales frame since Christmas of 2010 after being discounted to 99 cents on Amazon.[139] On the week ending March 14, 2015, the album completed 200 weeks in the chart since it debuted on September 11, 2010 making it the 25th album to spend more than 200 weeks or more on the Billboard 200.[2] On the week ending April 9, 2022, the album completed 270 weeks in the chart, making it the seventh album to spend more weeks by female artist on the Billboard 200.

Some pop stars spend their whole lives trying to put together a string of hits that amount to a lasting legacy; Katy Perry did it in the first 15 minutes. This album is a crowning achievement, not just of her career but of its style: EDM and disco and pop, bold and belting, entirely processed yet instantly recognizable, robust yet chintzy. \u2014 Anna Gaca of Pitchfork[117] Teenage Dream achieved a multitude of records throughout its run. Perry scored five Billboard Hot 100 number one singles from Teenage Dream, making her the second artist in the chart's 53-year history to amass five number-one singles from one album over its first release after Michael Jackson achieved the feat with his 1987 album Bad. Perry is the first female in history to achieve this milestone.[161][162] The album is one of only three albums to produce six or more top-five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (along with Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 and George Michael's Faith), and the first album to have seven songs top the Dance Club Songs chart, breaking the previous record set by Beyoncé's I Am... Sasha Fierce and Kristine W's The Power of Music, both with six songs.[163][164][165][166] Perry was able to replicate this success in the United Kingdom, breaking the Official Charts Company's record for the most Top 10 singles from one studio album by a female solo artist.[167] Eight songs from Teenage Dream have topped the Adult Top 40 chart and have topped Mainstream Top 40 chart, both more than any other album in each respective chart's history. Additionally, with seven chart-toppers from \"Waking Up in Vegas\", Perry broke the record for the longest streak of number ones on the Mainstream Top 40 set by Lady Gaga's first six singles.[168] The singles also allowed Perry to have an unprecedented 69-week long streak in the Hot 100's top-10, as well as a 71-week top-10 streak on the Airplay chart.[169] Perry also has the most number-one singles (four) from one album to top the Canadian Hot 100. Combined, the songs have sold a total of over 35 million copies worldwide aside from the album.[170] Also, the first five singles from the album topped the charts in the United States and attained top-10 positions in more than 20 countries. All five singles also topped the Digital and Airplay charts, making her the first artist ever to have five number-one singles in the Airplay chart.[171] Perry became the only artist to spend over 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, and later heightened this to 69 weeks, with the first five singles from album, breaking the 15-year long previous record held by Ace of Base of 48 weeks with three singles .[172] On the Mainstream Top 40 the album holds the unique record in the chart's history to have four songs from the same album in the top five of \"Most weekly plays\"; 1. \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" (12,468), 2. \"E.T.\" (12,361), 3. \"California Gurls\" (12,159), and 4. \"Firework\" (11,857).[173] In a retrospective review of the Teenage Dream, Pitchfork called the album \"a crowning achievement, not just of her career but of its style: EDM and disco and pop, bold and belting, entirely processed yet instantly recognizable, robust yet chintzy.\"[117] uDiscover Music wrote that the album \"holds an outsized influence on pop music landscape and the many artists she helped inspire\" and that it along with the \"Teenage Dream\" song \"lives on as a nostalgic spectacle that set the course for the pop icon's aesthetic\".[174] VH1 called Teenage Dream \"the most important pop album of the last 10 years\" and added \"it surged a blend of silliness into the dance genre that had been dominated by Lady Gaga's Fame Monster edge\".[175] In an interview for Apple Music for her album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power, American singer-songwriter Halsey called Teenage Dream the \"perfect pop album\", saying: \"Anyone who's trying to make a perfect pop album is wasting their time because Katy already did it with Teenage Dream.\"[176] Notes Adapted from the Teenage Dream liner notes.[19]   * Sales figures based on certification alone. ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.
