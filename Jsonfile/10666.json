{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia forms part of an ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On January 28, 2020, British Columbia became the second province to confirm a case of COVID-19 in Canada.[2] The first case of infection involved a patient who had recently returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China.[3] The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5, 2020.[4] British Columbians have taken numerous emergency measures in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and self-isolation. On March 23, 2020, British Columbian Premier John Horgan announced the details of the province-wide emergency relief plan, which includes income support, tax relief and direct funding in order to mitigate economic effects of the pandemic.[5] A public health emergency was declared in the province on March 17.[6] On June 29, 2021, BC Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth signed Ministerial Order M275[7] to come into effect at the end of the day on June 30, 2021, ending the province-wide state of emergency since March 18, 2020.[8] Several municipalities in the Metro Vancouver Regional District have declared local states of emergency, including Vancouver, New Westminster, Delta, Surrey, and Richmond.[9] On March 19, the BC Housing Management Commission placed a moratorium on evictions from government subsidized housing.[9] British Columbia provided an online self assessment tool for those who are concerned they may be infected.[10] First responders such as police and firefighters have begun to ask screening questions about COVID-19 symptoms prior to attendance, and may wear additional personal protective equipment upon attendance to residences.[11] Gatherings of over 50 people have been banned, and bars and nightclubs have been ordered to close.[12] Restaurants and cafes were initially permitted to remain open as long as staff were able to maintain physical distance from customers. However, on March 20, provincial health officer Bonnie Henry ordered the closure of all dine-in establishments.[13] On March 21, she ordered all personal service establishments, such as day spas, hair and beauty salons, and tattoo parlours, to close for the foreseeable future.[14] Many cities have closed public playgrounds, including Vancouver,[15] Delta,[16] Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, and Port Moody.[17] Numerous businesses have voluntarily reduced operating hours or closed physical locations. Many have moved operations to phone and internet.[18][9] Northeast facade of the Vancouver Art Gallery; normally a busy location, physical distancing has caused a sharp decrease in crowds. An almost empty SkyTrain; normally trains would be packed full of people. Closed movie theatre in Surrey Playground in Port Moody, closed off with caution tape. A sign indicates the playground is closed. The same playground, re-opened, with signage cautioning that special care should still be taken due to COVID-19. Data in the BC COVID-19 dashboard is updated from Monday to Friday only.[47] The number of cumulative cases and deaths on Saturdays, if available, are based on daily updates provided to the Government of Canada.[48] The numbers of cumulative cases and deaths on Sundays up to July 5 are calculated based on the surveillance report published next Monday. The numbers of cumulative cases on Sundays from July 12 onwards are calculated based on the \u201cNew Cases\u201d figure shown in the BC COVID-19 dashboard next Monday. *BC has revised the new case numbers for November 18, 20 and 21 where those are the days the province has topped the mark of 800 in a day. **November 24, where there were 941 new cases, has been revised to 706 cases. [49] ***2021 Easter long weekend revisions on new cases: 1,074 for Friday, 1,077 for Saturday, 999 for Sunday, and 890 for Monday.[50] Notes:  The first case in British Columbia was reported on January 28. The person had returned from Wuhan and began experiencing symptoms on January 26, with self-isolation beginning immediately.[51] The first case in BC's interior was reported on February 14. The person had recently returned from China, and was self-isolating.[52] The first case in the Fraser Health region was reported on February 20. This was also the first BC case where the person had travelled from Iran. The person immediately began self-isolation.[53] The first two cases in the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver were reported on March 7. One resident and one staff member were diagnosed,[54] and the centre is thought to be Canada's first case of community transmission.[55] BC's first two cases linked to the Grand Princess were hospitalized and also reported on March 7.[54] On March 9, the Lynn Valley outbreak resulted in Canada's first death: a man in his 80s with pre-existing health conditions.[55] On March 17, three more deaths were announced: two were at the Lynn Valley Care Center, and the other was \"in [a] hospital in the Fraser Health region\".[56] On March 19, a death was reported at the Lynn Valley Care Centre,[57] followed by an additional death on March 21.[58] On April 17, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced that B.C. had succeeded in reducing the number of cases, the health-care system was not overwhelmed, and that the province had \"flattened [the] curve\".[59] On May 13, it was disclosed that while in the quarantine system imposed by the government of British Columbia on international arrivals, eight farm workers out of 1,500 had tested positive for COVID-19 disease. The province started allowing imported farmhands in April and was the only province to implement mandatory quarantine.[60] On May 19, the government announced that it was advancing to phase 2 of the restart plan, allowing all retail, restaurants, libraries, museums, offices and childcare to reopen. Parks and beaches were also allowed to reopen with social distancing requirements in place. Medically necessary services for physiotherapy, dentistry, massage therapy and chiropractic were also allowed to resume, along with hair salons and counselling services.[61] On June 24, Premier John Horgan and Henry announced that BC had successfully flattened the curve enough to allow the province to proceed to phase 3 of the restart plan, allowing the film industry to resume, and a return for in-person education for elementary and high school students in September. Gatherings of people greater than 50 were still prohibited.[62][63] Entry to stage 4 was conditional on \"widespread vaccination, community immunity, or successful treatments\";[64] the national and global numbers of active cases also needed to decline in order for the province to recommend its implementation. Once BC moved to stage 4, conventions, concerts, international tourism, and professional sports would have been allowed.[64] In July 2020 the Provincial Government announced back to school plans for the 2020\u201321 school year.[65] In August 2020, the Ministry of Health reviewed guidance from the World Health Organization that indicated that younger children were likely not notable vectors of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, and were at significantly lower risk of developing COVID-19 than adults.[66][67] On October 19, Henry declared that British Columbia was in a second wave.[68] On October 30, MLA Adrian Dix announced an amended Provincial Health Officer order, which limits gatherings in private residences to six guests.[69][70] On October 21, British Columbia declared the first school outbreak at École de l\u2019Anse-au-sable in Kelowna.[71] On October 27, the President of UFCW 1518, Kim Novak, wrote to Henry requesting that she mandate that customers wear masks while shopping at grocery stores.[72] On October 29, Interior Health declared the outbreak at Okanagan Men's Centre in Winfield.[73] On November 7, Henry announced two-week regional lockdown measures including the restriction of all social gatherings of any size in the Fraser and Vancouver regions to immediate household members only from 10 p.m. until noon of November 23.

The Delta variant accounted for roughly 2% of these cases.[215] On May 25, Horgan and Henry announced BC's Restart, a plan to ease the current restrictions (including restrictions on gatherings, business capacity, and interprovincial travel) in four phases, based on cases, hospitalizations, and vaccination progress. The process was expected to be completed by September.[216] On May 27, the B.C. government announced that the time in between Moderna and Pfizer vaccine shots was reduced to around eight weeks.[217] In the week of May 28, the number of COVID-19 cases attributed to the Delta variant rose to seven percent.[218] On June 3, Henry reported three outbreaks at B.C. care homes involving the Delta variant.[219] On June 15, due to declining cases and at least 65% of adults having received at least one vaccine dose, the province entered Step 2 of BC's Restart. This included lifting the interprovincial travel ban, and easing of capacity limits on gatherings and some businesses. The Delta variant was stated to be a \"concern\" in the province, but was not yet spreading rapidly.[220][221] Over the Family Day weekend, Fraser Health (which had been the region most-impacted by COVID-19 provincially) administered 7,000 vaccine doses in a 32-hour \"Vax-a-Thon\" in Surrey.[222][223] On July 1, the province entered Step 3 of BC's Restart; this eased further restrictions, including the indoor mask mandate, personal gatherings, some business capacity limits (subject to WorkSafeBC \"communicable disease prevention guidance\"), and casinos, nightclubs, and indoor sporting events to operate at limited capacities.[224] On July 27, Dix, Henry, and Dr. Penny Ballem discussed aspects of the province's vaccine rollout and how it would deal with those who have actively refused the vaccine, with Henry stating that \"It is a choice to be immunized, but there are consequences for people who are not immunized and that's going to be more important for us as we head into the fall\".[225] On July 28, health officials announced that the indoor mask mandate would be reinstated for the central Okanagan region, and that travel into the region would be discouraged regardless of vaccination status. The province cited an ongoing surge of COVID-19 cases in the region, particularly among younger residents; at least 323 cases had been recorded in the region since July 1, and the majority of them were among residents who were not yet fully-vaccinated.[226][227] On August 6, additional public health orders were announced for the region effective August 9, including ordering the closure of bars and nightclubs that do not serve food, ending liquor sales at 10 p.m. nightly, private gatherings restricted to five people, events restricted to 50 people with safety plan, and prohibiting high-intensity fitness classes.[228] On August 8, the BCCDC suggested almost all COVID-19 cases reported in the last week of July were caused by the Delta variant.[229] On August 9, B.C. reduced the interval between two COVID-19 vaccine doses from seven weeks to four weeks.[230] On August 12, Dix and Henry announced all employees of assisted living and long-term care facilities in the province must be fully vaccinated by October 12.[231] On August 20, it was announced that all targeted public health orders for the central Okanagan would be extended to the entirety of the Interior Health region. Henry stated that infections were \"levelling off\" in the central Okanagan, but that transmission had increased elsewhere in the region. She cited wildfire evacuations as a potential factor in these increases.[232] On August 23, Henry announced that proof of vaccination would become mandatory for people aged 12 and over at \"social, recreational, and discretionary events and businesses\",[233] such as restaurants, nightclubs, gyms, organized indoor events, and ticketed sporting events. Patrons under 12 must be accompanied by a vaccinated adult. Effective September 13, individuals must present proof of at least one vaccine dose, and by October 24 they must present proof of full vaccination. Henry stated that this order would last through at least January 31, 2022, but may be extended if needed. The measure will be enforced with a new B.C. vaccine card, which will also be downloadable for smartphones. There will be no exceptions for recent negative tests, or for medical or religious reasons that prevent vaccination; faith-based gatherings and K-12 school activities are not covered by the order.[234][235][236][237] The next day, Henry announced that the mask mandate for public indoor spaces would also be reinstated effective August 25, due to the Delta variant and the number of unvaccinated residents in the province. She also discussed plans for the next school year, allowing full-day, in-person learning as normal, but with masks mandatory for staff and students in grades 4 and up.[238][239] On August 27, B.C. reported an increase in breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals, which were attributed to unvaccinated people.[240] In response to a significant increase of cases in the Northern Health region, the province established regional restrictions on September 2.[241] On September 3, B.C.
