{"Content: ":"Batschkapp (Hessian dialect for a flat cap) is a rock and pop concert venue in Gwinnerstraße in Seckbach.[1]  Batschkapp was founded in 1976 to establish an autonomous and left-wing counter culture,[2] and opened on 11 December 1976.[3] It began as a cultural centre associated with the neighbourhood centre Arbeiterselbsthilfe which was located in the inn \"Zum Elfmeter\", in Maybachstraße next to Frankfurt Eschersheim station. This had been called \"Wirtschaft zum Bahnhof\" in 1910, and used as a dormitory for approximately 100 forced labourers between 1940 and 1945. It was then used as an operetta theatre and a cinema from 1949 to 1965.[4] Joschka Fischer was a regular visitor in the early days.[5][6] At the beginning of the 1980s, Batschkapp was in financial difficulties caused by extensions of fire safety and other standards and had tax debts of DM 30,000. A benefit concert in 1982 with Ideal and BAP among the bands generated enough profit to keep the venue in business.[7] To celebrate its 30-year anniversary, a double CD \"Batschkapp 76-06 \u2013 30 Jahre Hörgenuss\" was issued.[7][8] Batschkapp moved on 10 December 2013. The original venue was demolished in February 2016, after archaeological excavations were made because the site was within the grounds of RühlŽsche Hof, to enable the building of flats and a supermarket.[9][10][11] The new venue in Gwinnerstraße in Seckbach is a former plastics factory and has a capacity of 1500 whereas the old venue at the bridge Maybachbrücke in Eschersheim had a capacity of 350, which was sometimes exceeded.[12][13][14] To celebrate its 40-year anniversary, a booklet \"40 Jahre Batschkapp \u2013 Eine Legende\" was published.[3] Batschkapp won the Live Entertainment Award for the best club of the year at the Musikmesse Frankfurt in March 2012.[15]","Title":"Batschkapp - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6672","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batschkapp"}
