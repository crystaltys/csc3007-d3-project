{"Content: ":"Ukraine participated in and won the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in Turin, Italy. Alina Pash was set to represent the country with the song \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\", after being chosen by the Ukrainian broadcaster Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (UA:PBC) via the national selection Vidbir. Following controversy regarding her travel history, Pash's status as a legitimate participant of Vidbir was challenged, which resulted in her participation being ceased by the broadcaster as well as her withdrawal. The runner-up of Vidbir, Kalush Orchestra with the song \"Stefania\", was chosen as the Ukrainian entry for the contest in Pash's place. Kalush Orchestra eventually became the sixty-ninth winner of the Eurovision Song Contest, winning the public vote with 439 points, the most televoting points received in the contest's history to date, and coming in fourth place in the jury vote with 192 points, for a total tally of 631 points. Prior to the 2022 contest, Ukraine has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest sixteen times since its first entry in 2003, winning it in the following year with the song \"Wild Dances\" performed by Ruslana. Following the introduction of semi-finals for 2004, Ukraine is the only country that has managed to qualify to the final in every contest they have participated in thus far. Ukraine has been the runner-up in the contest on two occasions: in 2007 with \"Dancing Lasha Tumbai\" by Verka Serduchka and in 2008 with \"Shady Lady\" by Ani Lorak; and it won the contest for a second time in 2016 with \"1944\" by Jamala. Ukraine's least successful result has been 24th place, which they achieved, as hosts, in 2017, with the song \"Time\" performed by O.Torvald. The country came 5th in the final in 2021 with \"Shum\" by Go_A, scoring 364 points. The Ukrainian national broadcaster, Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (UA:PBC), broadcasts the event within Ukraine and organizes the selection process for the nation's entry. Suspilne confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest on 18 June 2021.[1] In the past, UA:PBC has alternated between both internal selections and national finals in order to select the Ukrainian entry. Between 2016 and 2020, UA:PBC, in collaboration with STB, set up national finals with several artists to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Ukraine, with both the public and a panel of jury members involved in the selection. On 30 August 2021, it was announced that UA:PBC had terminated their partnership with STB.[2] On 8 October 2021, the broadcaster announced that they would independently organise a national final to select the 2022 Ukrainian entry and requested proposals from production companies with a deadline of 24 October 2021.[3] The selected company, Friends Pro TV, was announced on 29 December 2021.[4] The Ukrainian national final took place in the NAU Center of Culture and Arts in Kyiv on 12 February 2022, and was hosted by Maria Efrosinina with Timur Miroshnychenko as backstage host.[5][6][7][8] The selection of the competing entries for the national final and ultimately the Ukrainian Eurovision entry took place over three stages. In the first stage, artists and songwriters had the opportunity to apply for the competition through an online submission form.[9] Twenty-seven acts were longlisted and announced on 17 January 2022. The second stage was a scheduled audition at designated dates and featured the twenty-seven acts in the longlist. Eight acts were selected to advance, which were announced on 24 January 2022. The third stage was the final, which took place on 12 February 2022 and featured the eight acts vying to represent Ukraine in Turin. The winner was selected via the 50/50 combination of votes from a public televote and a three-member expert jury,[10] consisting of 2006 Ukrainian entrant Tina Karol, 2016 Ukrainian entrant Jamala and Suspilne board member Yaroslav Lodyhin [uk].[11][12] Artists and composers had the opportunity to submit their entries between 14 December 2021 and 10 January 2022. Only artists that had not performed in a concert in Russia since 2014 nor entered the territory of Crimea without due permission were able to apply for the competition.[9] A selection panel including the music producer of the show Mykhailo Koshevy and the television producer of the show Oleksiy Honcharenko reviewed the 284 received submissions, and twenty-seven entries that had been longlisted were announced on 17 January 2022.[13][14] Auditions were later held at the My Dream Space venue in Kyiv where eight entries were shortlisted to compete in the national final.[14] On 24 January 2022, the eight selected competing acts were announced.[15] It was later announced by UA:PBC that Laud was disqualified from the competition as his song \"Head Under Water\" was previously released in 2018, which is in violation of the rules. Barleben took his place in the final lineup with the song \"Hear My Words\".[16] The final took place on 12 February 2022. Former Ukrainian Eurovision entrants Tina Karol (2006), Jamala (2016) and Go_A (2021) were guest performers at the final. In addition, Ukrainian Junior Eurovision entrants Darina Krasnovetska (2018), Sophia Ivanko (2019), Oleksandr Balabanov (2020), and Olena Usenko (2021) performed a medley of past Ukrainian Eurovision entries (\"1944\", \"Shum\", \"Dancing Lasha Tumbai\", and \"Wild Dances\").[18] Alina Pash won the televised version of the competition. Later, she was ceased from participating in the national selection after it was discovered that her representative had provided UA:PBC with a falsified certificate of her travel history.[19] On 22 February 2022, it was announced that the televote winner and runner-up of the competition, Kalush Orchestra, would represent Ukraine at Eurovision.[20] Following Alina Pash's victory, runner-up Kalush Orchestra accused the organisers of falsifying the results. Lead singer Oleh Psiuk claimed that the organisers of the selection had refused to speak to him after several technical issues had occurred during the announcement of the results. Incorrect points were given during the allocation of the televotes, leading to a failure of the electronic scoreboard, meaning that host Timur Miroshnychenko had to manually announce the results from a sheet of paper.[24] After the show, a video emerged of Psiuk confronting a producer in a corridor.[25] On a livestream, Psiuk claimed that the producer had refused to answer his questions, and went on to state that he intended to challenge the organisers in court. Suspilne and its audit partner PwC maintained the validity of the results, stating that the technical difficulties had had no impact on the results. However, Yaroslav Lodyhin, chairman of the organising committee of Vidbir as well as one of the jurors in the competition, stated that he would be ready to resign from his position as further proof of the broadcaster's good faith,[26] and his resignation came into effect on 18 February.[27] The full results of the selection were published on 22 February.[23][28] On 16 February 2022, a 2015 VK post by runner-up Kalush Orchestra member Tymofii Muzychuk surfaced, portraying the musician in front of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The band's management stated that the photo had been taken before 2014, and that Muzychuk had traveled to Russia in 2013 to perform at a Mykhailo Poplavskyi [uk] concert in Moscow and at an event in Krasnodar, which he claimed to have been his last time in the country.[29] Following the controversy surrounding Maruv at Vidbir 2019, which led to Ukraine withdrawing from the Eurovision Song Contest that year, a new rule was introduced starting from Vidbir 2020 which bars artists who have performed in Russia since 2014 or have entered Crimea \"in violation of the legislation of Ukraine\" from entering the competition.[30] On 14 February 2022, activist and video blogger Serhii Sternenko alleged that Pash had entered Crimea from Russian territory in 2015, and counterfeited her travel documentation with her team in order to take part in Vidbir.[31] UA:PBC subsequently stated that they would request the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service to verify if the documentation is forged, and that Pash would not officially be the Ukrainian representative at the contest \"until the verification and clarification of the facts is completed\".[32] Andrii Demchenko, speaking on behalf of the Guard Service, maintained that the certificate Pash had handed in to the broadcaster had not been issued by them, but that a request to cross the border had been made by the artist, and that the public broadcaster would be provided with the results of the investigation by 16 February at 11:00 (EET).[33][34] Svitlana Ostapa [uk], chair of the Supervisory Board of UA:PBC, later called a meeting, which was held on 18 February, in order to discuss the situation surrounding Vidbir.[33][34][35] Pash's management addressed the accusations stating that she had entered Crimea from the Ukrainian border, and that the certificate had been requested by a \"team member\" rather than Pash herself. They had assured to be analyzing the circumstances surrounding the obtainment of the document.[36] On 16 February, Pash claimed on an Instagram post that the State Border Guard Service had not been able to provide her with a new certificate as proof of her entrance to Crimea, as she had requested in the wake of the controversy, since related records are only kept for five years.[37] Shortly after, Pash announced on her social media pages that she would withdraw her candidacy as the Ukrainian representative at the Eurovision Song Contest.[19] On the same day, UA:PBC stated it had decided to \"cease her participation\" and that \"the artist agreed with this decision of the organizing committee\".[38] On 2 June 2022, Pash admitted to forging the documents and apologised for her actions.[39] After it became clear that Alina Pash would not represent Ukraine at Eurovision, Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC stated that, according to the rules of Vidbir, they would select another representative among the other competing artists in the national final during the meeting of 18 February,[40][41] without specifying when they would announce the result of the selection. Runner-up Kalush Orchestra were offered the proposal on 17 February.[42] On 21 February, it was reported that the band would refuse to sign the participation contract until the detailed results of the national final were released.[43] On 22 February, simultaneously with the release of the detailed results, the band accepted the offer to represent Ukraine at Eurovision.[20] Following the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, UA:PBC and Kalush Orchestra had yet to formally comment on whether their Eurovision participation would continue.[44][45] On 14 March, Claudio Fasulo [it] and Simona Martorelli, executive producers of the 2022 contest, confirmed that Ukraine would still be competing; this was later reaffirmed by UA:PBC on 19 March via a post on its social media pages.[46][47][48] They added that work would commence on the Ukrainian 'live-on-tape' backup performance, which was planned to be recorded in Lviv and used in the event that the delegation could not travel to Turin,[49][50] however, the delegation was later exempted from the requirement to do so.[51] On 2 April, UA:PBC confirmed that Kalush Orchestra and the rest of the delegation were given permission from state authorities to travel to Turin for the contest, adding that the group would also take part in promotional events across Europe to raise donations for war relief efforts.[52][53][54] According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 25 January 2022, an allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Ukraine was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 10 May 2022, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show.[55] Once all the competing songs for the 2022 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Ukraine was set to perform in position 6, following the entry from Slovenia and before the entry from Bulgaria.[56] At the end of the show, Ukraine was announced as a qualifier for the final. Ukraine won the final with 631 overall points, ahead of the United Kingdom and Spain.[57] Ukraine's 439 points received from the televote in the final are the most televoting points received in the contest's history to date, and Ukraine also received points from every country in the televote (with all but Serbia giving the country 8, 10 or 12 points). The total winning score of 631 represented 67% of the maximum score possible, 936 points, making it the second highest relative score since the current scoring system was adopted in 2016. \"Stefania\" is the first song sung entirely in Ukrainian to win the contest, as well as the first winning hip-hop song.   The following members comprised the Ukrainian jury:[60] The Ukrainian jury votes in the final faced scrutiny on Ukrainian and Polish social media. While the Polish jury awarded 12 points to Ukraine, the Ukrainian jury did not award Poland any points (the Ukrainian televote awarded 12 points to Poland regardless); this led to some suggesting that the Ukrainian jury votes might have been affected by pro-Russian agents intending to damage Polish\u2013Ukrainian relations.[61] Ukraine's ambassador to Poland Andrii Deshchytsia and the Ukrainian minister of culture Oleksandr Tkachenko criticized the jury's decision, with the latter calling it \"embarrassing\".[62][63][64][65] The Ukrainian jury members stated that their votes represented their own views, and were not related to any political considerations.[66]","Title":"Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16394","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2022"}
