{"Content: ":"This article contains the monthly cumulative number of deaths from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported by each country, territory, and subnational area to the World Health Organization (WHO) and published in WHO reports, tables, and spreadsheets.[1][2][3] There are also maps and timeline graphs of daily and weekly deaths worldwide.[note 1][note 2] 6,393,427[4] (updated 28 July 2022) confirmed COVID-induced deaths have been reported worldwide. As of May 2022, taking into account likely COVID induced deaths via excess deaths, the 95% confidence interval suggests the pandemic to have caused between 14.7 and 24.9 million deaths.[5][6] For the latest daily updates of cases, deaths, and death rates see COVID-19 pandemic death rates by country. For even more international statistics in table, graph, and map form see COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory. Data for the graphs is from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.[note 1] Rolling 7-day average.
