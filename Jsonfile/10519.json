{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Syria is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was confirmed to have reached Syria on 22 March 2020, when the first case was confirmed of a person who came from abroad.[4] Syria is considered especially vulnerable to the pandemic due to the ongoing civil war and dire humanitarian situation.[5][6] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[7][8] Many people in Syria did not have confidence in the government's transparency during the pandemic, accusing it of hiding the true numbers of cases and deaths,[9][10][11][12] especially in Damascus, Rif Dimashq, and Aleppo.[13][14][15] It has been speculated that doctors in hospitals and medical facilities were being threatened by being fired or even being arrested and detained by the government forces if they said anything about the truth of what's happening in the hospitals.[16][17] It has also been rumoured that the Syrian state has even gone so far as to suggest terminating the lives of suspected COVID-19 patients.[18] Which led to people who are experiencing some symptoms or even being sure about being infected not telling the government nor seeking governmental or even private medical care, and quarantining themselves at home as possible out of fear.[19] Analysts reasoning with these claims highlight the example of misinformation about the government's numbers is the number of cases registered in neighboring countries of people arriving from Syria, and sometimes that number in one day is greater than those reported by the Syrian government during a certain period of time.[20][21] The Syrian government along with its allies claims that the ongoing civil war, combined with the economic situation in Syria and sanctions by western governments, limit the capacity in which adequate COVID-19 PCR tests can be conducted and prevent vital supplies for treating and managing the pandemic from being imported.[22][23] The response has been led by Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash since 2020.[24]  2 March: The government of the Kurdistan Region in Iraq, ordered the complete closure of the Semalka Border Crossing at the Iraq\u2013Syria border into the Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria until further notice as \"a precautionary measure to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus to the areas of autonomous administration of North and East Syria, excluding emergency cases\".[25] 10 March: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that there have been outbreaks of COVID-19 in Tartus, Damascus, Homs and Latakia provinces. According to the UK-based monitor's sources, a strict gag order has been issued to forbid medical personnel from discussing the issue.[26] 11 March: A health official from the Jazira Region in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria said that there are no documented cases of COVID-19 in the province. Kurdistan TV reported from Qamishli, the largest Kurdish city in Syria, stating that 1% of the population in the city are wearing protective masks, as pharmacies and medical equipment sales centers were running low on the supply of masks. Furthermore, by 11 March, four suspected cases of COVID-19 had been reported to the Syrian Health Authority, which contacted the World Health Organization. The tests came back as negative.[27] 13 March: 14 March: 15 March: The Cabinet tasked the Industry Ministry with instructing private sector factories that produce cleaning and sanitization products to work at maximum capacity with no less than three shifts to ensure their availability. The Ministries were instructed to implement the decision to reduce working hours and to provide the necessary cleaning and sanitization products at work places. The Cabinet also decided to cancel the export of all the medical requirements and equipment for diagnosis and quarantine centers.[33] 19 March: The Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria imposed a curfew starting from 23 March at 06:00 am and prohibited movement among the subregions of northeastern Syria, as well as among the major cities within each region starting from 21 March at 06:00. Restaurants, cafes, commercial centers, bazaars, public parks, private medical clinics, wedding halls and mourning tents are to be closed while hospitals, public and private health centers, international organizations, the Red Cross and Crescent, pharmacies, sterilization committees, cleaners, bakeries, food stores, food and baby milk trucks and fuel tanks were excluded from the ban.[34] 20 March: Damascus Governorate and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent began disinfection of Yusuf al-Azma Square and other areas of Damascus.[35] 21 March: 22 March: 23 March: The Ministry of Press decided to suspend the publication of printed newspapers until further notice.[40] 24 March: The Ministry of Interior declared a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am, effective starting next day (Wednesday, 25 March).[41][e] 25 March: The Ministry of Health reported three new cases.

The Ministry of Health itself said many times that its testing capabilities are not enough,[252][253][173] and that many asymptomatic and symptomatic cases may go unnoticed because it's not possible to do widespread or random testing.[253] Many local news networks and organizations said that hospitals are even refusing to admit patients with mild symptoms, and only accept those who need critical and intensive care.[254][255] Some hospitals announced in early August that they have no more places for COVID-19 patients to be admitted, and asked anyone who suspects of being infected to self-quarantine at home instead of going to hospital.[255] The Syrian government claims that the ongoing civil war, combined with the economic situation in Syria and sanctions by western governments, limit the capacity in which adequate COVID-19 PCR tests can be conducted and prevent vital supplies for treating and managing the pandemic from being imported.[22][23] Health care professionals claimed the country was overwhelmed by cases and that the government had engaged in an intimidation campaign to suppress information of the outbreak.[256][12] According to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian government failed to protect health workers at the front line of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the government-held territory. WHO has provided the Syrian government with 4.4 million items of PPE, including medical and respirator masks, gloves. However, doctors and nurses operating in government-held areas said that there were still severe shortages of supplies, particularly in rural areas.[257] According to the Syrian Ministry of Health, there are six labs that are able to test for the coronavirus located in four governorates.[1] According to the Syrian Ministry of Health, there are 33 quarantine centers for suspected COVID-19 cases located in 13 governorates (All governorates Except Idlib).[1] According to the Syrian Ministry of Health, there are 21 Treatment centers dedicated for COVID-19 patients located in 12 governorates.[1] According to the state media organization SANA, the Ministry of Health started quarantining suspected cases and people coming from outside the country in free-of-charge dedicated quarantine facilities from 5 February 2020.[258] Information from the Ministry of Health as of 25 September.[1]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Syria - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10519","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Syria"}
