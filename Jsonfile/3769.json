{"Content: ":"The James Buchanan Memorial is a bronze and granite memorial in the southeast corner of Meridian Hill Park Northwest, Washington, D.C. It was designed by architect William Gorden Beecher, and sculpted by Maryland artist Hans Schuler.[1][2] Commissioned in 1916, but not approved by the U.S. Congress until 1918, it was completed and unveiled June 26, 1930. The memorial features a statue of Buchanan bookended by male and female classical figures representing law and diplomacy, engraved with text from a member of Buchanan's cabinet, Jeremiah S. Black: The incorruptible statesman whose walk was upon the mountain ranges of the law.[3] The memorial in the nation's capital complemented an earlier monument, constructed in 1907\u201308 and dedicated in 1911, on the site of Buchanan's birthplace in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania.","Title":"James Buchanan Memorial - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3769","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan_Memorial"}
