{"Content: ":"Greenbackville is a census-designated place (CDP) 4.5 miles (5 km) south of Stockton, Maryland in Accomack County, Virginia, located just south of the Maryland state line. The population as of the 2010 Census was 192.[3] The town was settled in 1867 and was officially named \"Greenbackville\" by the United States Postal Service in 1874. Greenbackville and neighboring Franklin City, Virginia grew as a result of the railroad line, the Worcester railroad, completed on April 7, 1876 [4] to transport oysters and other shellfish from Chincoteague to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. However, during the course of the 20th century the Depression, the construction of the Chincoteague Causeway, and the nor'easter of 1962 all helped to erode Greenbackville's economic base.[5] The railroad line from the Maryland State line into Franklin City was abandoned in 1956.[6] The population of Accomack County near Greenbackville grew with the creation of Captain's Cove, a planned residential community just west of Greenbackville.[citation needed] ","Title":"Greenbackville, Virginia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2218","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenbackville,_Virginia"}
