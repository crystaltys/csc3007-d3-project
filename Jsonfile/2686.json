The hoard comprises 92 silver coins, including two Arabic dirhams, several silver ingots, and one silver bracelet.[1] The hoard is thought to have been deposited in about AD 955.[1] This is the largest Viking hoard ever to have been found in the Furness area, and has been described as a \"missing link\" because it is the first significant archaeological evidence of Norse inhabitation in the area even though many local place names, such as Barrow, Yarlside, Roa Island and Ormsgill, are Old Norse in origin.[1] The hoard has been held at the Dock Museum in Barrow-in-Furness since discovery, and the Dock Museum has indicated that it hopes to acquire the hoard after it has been valued by the Treasure Valuation Committee.[2]","Title":"Furness Hoard - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2686","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furness_Hoard"}
