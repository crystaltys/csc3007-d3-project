{"Content: ":"The hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013somatotropic axis (HPS axis), or hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013somatic axis, also known as the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013growth axis, is a hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis which includes the secretion of growth hormone (GH; somatotropin) from the somatotropes of the pituitary gland into the circulation and the subsequent stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; somatomedin-1) production by GH in tissues such as, namely, the liver.[1][2][3] Other hypothalamic\u2013pituitary hormones such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH; somatocrinin), growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH; somatostatin), and ghrelin (GHS) are involved in the control of GH secretion from the pituitary gland.[1] The HPS axis is involved in postnatal human growth.[1] Individuals with growth hormone deficiency or Laron syndrome (GHR insensitivity) show symptoms like short stature, dwarfism and obesity, but are also protected from some forms of cancer.[4][5] Conversely, acromegaly and gigantism are conditions of GH and IGF-1 excess usually due to a pituitary tumor, and are characterized by overgrowth and tall stature.[6][7] This biology article is a stub.
