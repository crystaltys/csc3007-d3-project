Videos and images posted on social media showed large columns of black smoke several hours after the initial explosions. An analyst told The Guardian that the fires were likely an act of sabotage by Ukraine, although responsibility remained uncertain.[37][38] Unconfirmed reports in the Russian media suggested the fires could have been caused by a drone attack; on the same day, two Bayraktar TB2 drones were reportedly shot down in Bryansk Oblast.[39] On 26 April, an inert mine was discovered along a railway track in Bryansk.[40] On 27 April, an ammunition depot near Staraya Nelidovka [ru] in Belgorod Oblast caught fire.[41][42] On 29\u201330 April, a border checkpoint near Krupets in the Rylsky District in Kursk Oblast was repeatedly shelled, according to the governor.

According to official sources, a product caught fire, causing the explosion. The resulting fire killed one worker instantly, gave one fatal injuries, and hospitalized another.

Near the bridge, a block of apartments was badly damaged, a car was burnt out and the local sugar refinery suffered some damage .[1] Klintsy and its surrounding regions in Bryansk Oblast were shelled for three days straight beginning in 12 June. The first two days of attacks were more minor incidents targeting military bases, with little to no casualties. On 14 June a helicopter fired missiles at residential areas in the city, damaging dozens of houses and ripping a woman's leg off.[66] Authorities recorded six injuries on 14 June.[67] Haaretz described bombing of Russian villages on the Ukrainian border as \"constant\" and attributed them to the Ukrainian army fire.[68] On July 3, Russian officials said that a group of explosions targeting civilian areas had killed four people and destroyed 50 buildings in Belgorod. Russia blamed Ukraine for the attack and Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that Russia had shot down three Ukrainian ballistic missiles. Ukraine denied it was responsible.[69][70] Schools in Bryansk Oblast were closed following the attack on 14 April and four regions in Russia increased their security measures.[32][71] On April 15, Russia launched major missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in retaliation for the attacks.[33] The Russian attacks were the largest of their kind to take place since Russia cancelled its offensive into Kyiv Oblast.[72] Ukraine rejected the claims that it was responsible for the 14 April attacks, instead asserting that Russian intelligence services were trying to \"carry out terrorist acts to whip up anti-Ukrainian hysteria\" in the country.[73][32] After the attack, the Security Service of Ukraine released what it claimed were intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers showing that Russia deliberately fired on the villages in order to blame Ukraine. One of the alleged soldiers refers to the Russian apartment bombings in 1999 where he says that the \"same shit happened in the Chechen war. Apartments were blown up in Moscow, like they were terrorists. In fact, they are FSB officers.\"[74] In response to accusations regarding the April 13 Bryansk border checkpoint incident by Russia's FSB security service, Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said that something \"fell and caught fire\" at a Russian military facility, without explicitly confirming or denying Ukrainian responsibility.[26] On 27 April, Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, commented on the recent incidents. Without directly admitting that Ukraine was responsible, he said that it was not possible to \"sit out\" the Russian invasion. \"And therefore, the disarmament of the Belgorod and Voronezh killers' warehouses is an absolutely natural process. Karma is a cruel thing,\".[75]","Title":"2022 Western Russia attacks - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16096","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Western_Russia_attacks"}
