{"Content: ":"Hardfloor is a German electronic music duo, consisting of Oliver Bondzio and Ramon Zenker.[1] Their most famous track is \"Acperience 1\" (often titled more simply as \"Acperience\" on many compilation albums)[1] and chosen by Feargal Sharkey as one of his 'Inheritance Tracks'[2] when interviewed on UK's BBC Radio 4. Their distinctive acid house sound is attributed to their skill at manipulating Roland TB-303 bass synthesisers,[1] using up to six of these machines at once. Their UK chart hits include \"Hardtrance Acperience\" (1992), \"Trancescript\" (1993) and the remix of the aforementioned \"Acperience\" (1997).[3] Their 1996 album, Home Run, peaked at No. 68 in the UK Albums Chart.[3] Hardfloor also released albums under the pseudonym Da Damn Phreak Noize Phunk. These songs tend toward the chillout and lounge genres.[citation needed]","Title":"Hardfloor - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6628","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardfloor"}
