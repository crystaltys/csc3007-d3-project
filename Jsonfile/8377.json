{"Content: ":"Vicente Trueba Pérez (October 16, 1905 in Sierrapando, Torrelavega, Cantabria \u2013 November 10, 1986) was a Spanish professional road racing cyclist. He is most famous for being the first winner of King of the Mountains for winning the overall classification in the Mountains classification of Tour de France. He also finished sixth overall of Tour de France. His brother José have been also cyclist professional. In 1933, the King of the Mountains classification was first calculated. The winner was Vicente Trueba, who reached the tops of most mountains first. However, Trueba was a very bad descender, so he never gained anything from reaching the tops first. The Tour de France director, Henri Desgrange, decided that cyclists should receive a bonus for reaching the tops first.  This biographical article relating to Spanish cycling is a stub.
