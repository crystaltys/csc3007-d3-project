In 2015, he became commander of the Russian Armed Forces in Syria during the Russian military intervention there. At that time he cemented a reputation for the harsh conduct of his military campaigns as those in Chechnya before.[2][3] In April 2022, Dvornikov was placed in charge of military operations during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Dvornikov was born on 22 August 1961 in Ussuriysk. He graduated from the Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School in 1978 and joined the Soviet Army.

He has been accused of having pursued scorched earth tactics. Retired US Navy Admiral James G. Stavridis spoke in an interview of what he said was a known epiphet of Dvornikov, \"Butcher of Syria\".[2][15]","Title":"Aleksandr Dvornikov - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15766","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dvornikov"}
