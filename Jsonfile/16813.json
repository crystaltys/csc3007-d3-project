{"Content: ":"The public image of Vladimir Putin concerns the image of Vladimir Putin, current President of Russia, among residents of Russia and worldwide. According to public opinion surveys conducted by NGO Levada Center, Putin's approval rating was 60% in July 2020.[1] Putin's popularity rose from 31% in August 1999 to 80% in November 1999, never dropping below 65% during his first presidency.[2] In January 2013, his approval rating fell to 62%, the lowest point since 2000 and a ten-point drop over two years.[3] Observers see Putin's high approval ratings as a consequence of the significant improvements in living standards and Russia's reassertion of itself on the world scene that has occurred during his period of office.[4][5] One analysis attributed Putin's popularity, in part, to state-owned or state-controlled television.[6] A joint poll by World Public Opinion in the US and Levada Center [7] in Russia around June\u2013July 2006 stated that \"neither the Russian nor the American publics are convinced Russia is headed in an anti-democratic direction\" and \"Russians generally support Putin's concentration of political power and strongly support the re-nationalization of Russia's oil and gas industry.\" Russians generally support the political course of Putin and his team.[8] A 2005 survey showed that three times as many Russians felt the country was \"more democratic\" under Putin than it was during the Yeltsin or Gorbachev years, and the same proportion thought human rights were better under Putin than Yeltsin.[6] In January 2013, at the time of 2011\u20132013 Russian protests, Putin's approval rating fell to 62%, the lowest figure since 2000 and a ten-point drop over two years.[9] By May 2014, following the annexation of Crimea, Putin's approval rating had rebounded to 85.9%, a six-year high.[10] After EU and U.S. sanctions against Russian officials as a result of the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin's approval rating reached 87 percent, according to a Levada Center survey published on 6 August 2014.[11][12] In February 2015, based on new domestic polling, Putin was ranked the world's most popular politician.[13] In June 2015, Putin's approval rating climbed to 89%, an all-time high.[14][15][16] In 2016, the approval rating was 81%.[17] Observers see Putin's high approval ratings as a consequence of significant improvements in living standards, and Russia's reassertion of itself on the world scene during his presidency.[18][19] Despite high approval for Putin, confidence in the Russian economy is low, dropping to levels in 2016 that rivaled the recent lows in 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis. Just 14% of Russians in 2016 said their national economy was getting better, and 18% said this about their local economies.[20] Putin's performance at reining in corruption is also unpopular among Russians. Newsweek reported in June 2017 that \"An opinion poll by the Moscow-based Levada Center indicated that 67 percent held Putin personally responsible for high-level corruption\".[21] In July 2018, Putin's approval rating fell to 63% and just 49% would vote for Putin if presidential elections were held.[22] Levada poll results published in September 2018 showed Putin's personal trustworthiness levels at 39% (decline from 59% in November 2017)[23] with the main contributing factor being the presidential support of the unpopular pension reform and economic stagnation.[24][25] In October 2018, two thirds of Russians surveyed in Levada poll agreed that \"Putin bears full responsibility for the problems of the country\", which has been attributed[26] to decline of a popular belief in \"good tsar and bad boyars\", a traditional attitude towards justifying failures of the ruling hierarchy in Russia.[27] In May 2020, Putin's approval rating dropped to a historic low of 59% in an April poll by the Levada Center.[28] In December 2021, a Levada Center poll found that 65% approved of Putin personally, That jumped to 69% who had a positive view of Putin in January 2022, and 71% who approved of the Russian president in February 2022 (before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine).[29][30] According to a 2017 survey by the Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association (WIN/GIA), Putin's international reputation increased significantly between 2015 and 2017 (43% favorable in 2017 compared with 33% in 2015).[31] Some of these views have changed considerably over time ever since 2017. For instance, in Romania, in a 2022 poll, only 3% of Romanians had a positive opinion of Putin while 70% of Romanians had a negative one.[32] Since the 2010s, voters of the Republican Party have seen a shift in viewing Putin favorably. Most political analysts viewed the dramatic shift in sentiment as originating from Donald Trump's pro-Russian views.[33] In July 2014 an Economist and YouGov poll found that just 10% of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin. In September 2016, polling found that number rose to 24%, and in December 2016 found that 37% of Republicans view Putin favorably.[34] A Pew Research survey in 2018 found that a majority of Americans (68%) have an unfavorable opinion of Putin, while 16% have a favorable opinion. Republicans and independents (25%) said they had a favorable view of Putin overall.[35] Putin was Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2007.[36] In April 2008, Putin was put on the Time 100 most influential people in the world list.[37] On 4 December 2007, at Harvard University, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev credited Putin with having \"pulled Russia out of chaos\" and said he was \"assured a place in history\", despite Gorbachev's claim that the news media have been suppressed and that election rules run counter to the democratic ideals he has promoted.[38] In December 2011, amid the protests following the 2011 Russian elections Gorbachev criticized Putin for a decision to seek the third term in the presidential elections and advised Putin to leave politics.[39] Criticism of Putin has been widespread especially over the Runet.[40] It is said that the Russian youth organisations finance a full \"network\" of pro-government bloggers.[41] In the U.S. embassy cables, published by WikiLeaks in late 2010, Putin was called \"alpha dog\" and compared with Batman (while Dmitry Medvedev was compared with Batman's crime-fighting partner Robin). American diplomats said Putin's Russia had become \"a corrupt, autocratic kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Putin, in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together to create a \"virtual mafia state.\"[42][43] Putin called it \"slanderous\".[44] By western commentators and the Russian opposition, Putin has been described as a dictator.[45][46] Putin biographer Masha Gessen has stated that \"Putin is a dictator,\" comparing him to Alexander Lukashenko.[47][48] Former UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband has described Putin as a \"ruthless dictator\" whose \"days are numbered.\"[49] U.S. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney called Putin \"a real threat to the stability and peace of the world.\"[50] In the fall of 2011, the anti-Putin opposition movement in Russia became more visible, with street protests against allegedly falsified parliamentary elections (in favor of Putin's party, United Russia) cropping up across major Russian cities. Following Putin's re-election in March 2012, the movement struggled to redefine its new course of action.[51] In early September 2014 Patriarch Filaret, head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate, linked Putin with the biblical figure Cain because Filaret believed that although Putin claimed to be their \u201cbrother\u201d, he was responsible for \"shedding the brotherly blood\" of Ukrainians during the War in Donbass.[52] Filaret believed \"Satan went into him, as into Judas Iscariot\".[52] The Dalai Lama criticized Putin's foreign policy practices, claiming it to be responsible for isolating Russia from the rest of the world.[53][54][55] The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Putin as the 2014 Person of the Year, recognizing \"the person who does the most to enable and promote organized criminal activity.\"[56][57] According to Denis Volkov from Moscow Levada Center, drawing any conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them with Western polls is pointless as there's no real political competition in Russia. Unlike in democratic states, the Russian voters aren't offered any \"credible alternatives\" and the public opinion is formed primarily with state-controlled media which promotes the ruling party and discredits any alternative candidates.[58] This kind of illusion of democracy, choice only between \"A and A\", is part of \"Russian consciousness\", according to a nationalist publicist Alexander Prokhanov, who considers the \"elections between A and B\" to be part of a \"liberal\" mindset.[59] Putin's name and image are widely used in advertisements and product branding.[60] Among Putin-branded products are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, Gorbusha Putina caviar, and a collection of T-shirts with his image.[61] In October 2016, the luxury company, Caviar, produced a limited series of iPhone 7s made from Damascus steel called Supremo Putin Damascus. It features a golden bas-relief portrait of Putin.[62] Putin has created a cult of personality for himself as an outdoorsy, sporty, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical capabilities and taking part in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction with wild animals.[63] For example, in 2007, the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published a huge photograph of a bare-chested Putin vacationing in the Siberian mountains under the headline: \"Be Like Putin.\"[64] Such photo ops are part of a public relations approach that, according to Wired, \"deliberately cultivates the macho, take-charge superhero image\".[60] The British tabloid Daily Express has commented that this cultivated image runs counter to the reality of Putin's modest physical stature,[65] his height being officially reported as 170cm (5'7\"),[66] and some of the activities used to promote his virile prowess have been criticized for involving deception or being completely staged. Notable examples of Putin's macho adventures include:[67] On 11 December 2010, at a concert organized for a children's charity in Saint Petersburg, Putin sang Blueberry Hill with Maceo Parker's jazz band and played a little piano of it and of the Russian patriotic song С чего начинается Родина from his favourite spy movie The Shield and the Sword. After that he took part in singing of a Russian song about cosmonauts, Grass by the Home. The concert was attended by various Hollywood and European stars such as Kevin Costner, Sharon Stone, Alain Delon, and Gérard Depardieu.[90][91] Putin also played or sang \"С чего начинается Родина\" on a number of other occasions,[92] such as a meeting with the Russian spies deported from the U.S., including Anna Chapman.[93] Another melody which Putin is known to play on the piano is the Anthem of Saint Petersburg, his native city.[94] Putin's painting \"Узор на заиндевевшем окне\" (A Pattern on a Hoarfrost-Encrusted Window), which he had painted during the Christmas Fair on 26 December 2008, became the top lot at the charity auction in Saint Petersburg and sold for 37 million rubles.[95] The picture was made for a series of other paintings by famous Russians. The painters were required to illustrate one of the letters of the Russian alphabet with a subject connected to Nikolay Gogol's novel Christmas Eve (the 200th anniversary from Gogol's birth was celebrated in 2008). Putin's picture depicted a hoarfrost pattern (Russian: Узор, illustrating the Cyrillic letter У) on a window with curtains sewn with traditional Ukrainian ornaments.[95] The creation of the painting coincided with the 2009 Russia\u2013Ukraine gas dispute, which left a number of European states without Russian gas and amid January frosts.[96] A Russian movie called A Kiss not for Press was premiered in 2008 on DVD. The movie is said to be based on biography of Vladimir Putin and his wife Lyudmila.[97] Dobby, a house elf from Harry Potter film series, has been found to look like Putin,[98] and so was also Daniel Craig in his role of James Bond (he was the first blond actor to play James Bond).[99] There are a large number of songs about Putin.[100] Some of the more popular include: Putin also is a subject of Russian jokes and chastushki, such as \"[Before Putin] There Was No Orgasm\" featured in the comedy film The Day of Elections.[107] There is a meta-joke that, since the coming of Putin to power, all the classic jokes about a smart yet rude boy called Вовочка (Vovochka, diminutive from Vladimir) have suddenly become political jokes. Putin features in the colouring book for children Vova and Dima (presented on his 59th birthday),[108] where he and Dmitry Medvedev are drawn as good-behaving little boys, and in the Superputin online comics series, where Putin and Medvedev are portrayed first as superheroes,[60] and then as a troll and an orc in the World of Warcraft.[109] Putin was portrayed by internet personality Nice Peter in his YouTube series Epic Rap Battles of History, in Season 2's finale episode, \"Rasputin vs. Stalin\" (aired on 22 April 2013).[110] In 2014, Putin earned a nickname of \"dickhead\" or \"fuckface\" (\"хуйло\" in Russian and Ukrainian) in Ukraine, following the spread of the chant of Ukrainian football hooligans. On 14 June 2014, Ukraine's acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia cited the chant in front of the cameras during an anti-Russian rally at Russia's Embassy in Kyiv.[111] In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, leaders at the 48th G7 summit ridiculed Putin's photo ops\u2014particularly his bare-chested photographs\u2014including Boris Johnson.[112] Putin has produced a large number of popular aphorisms and catch-phrases, known as putinisms.[114] Many of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language.[114] The examples of most popular putinisms include:[115]","Title":"Public image of Vladimir Putin - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16813","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_image_of_Vladimir_Putin"}
