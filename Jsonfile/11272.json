{"Content: ":"Bebtelovimab is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.[2][6][7][8] Possible side effects include itching, rash, infusion-related reactions, nausea and vomiting.[2] Bebtelovimab works by binding to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19, similar to other monoclonal antibodies that have been authorized for the treatment of high-risk people with mild to moderate COVID-19 and shown a benefit in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death.[2] Bebtelovimab is a neutralizing human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody, isolated from a patient who has recovered from the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), directed against the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), that can potentially be used for immunization against COVID-19.[9] Bebtelovimab was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2022.[2] The EUA for bebtelovimab is for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in people aged 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) with a positive COVID-19 test, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.[2] Bebtelovimab is not authorized for people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.[2] Treatment with bebtelovimab has not been studied in people hospitalized due to COVID-19.[2] Bebtelovimab emerged from a collaboration between Eli Lilly and AbCellera.[6] Bebtelovimab was discovered by AbCellera and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center.[6][7] Bebtelovimab is the proposed international nonproprietary name (pINN).[10]  This antiinfective drug article is a stub.
