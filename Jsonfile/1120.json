{"Content: ":"Araripelepidotes is a genus of semionotiform fish. Araripelepidotes was probably endemic to the Araripe Basin, and was commonly found in Santana formation, and rare in the Crato Formation, mostly in carbonate concretions, but uncommon in laminated limestones.[1][2] The type species A. temnurus was formerly placed in the genus Lepidotes, until it was moved to the new genus in 1990.[1] Araripelepidotes was likely a toothless suction feeder, due to the development of its mobile maxilla and the presence of an interoperculum, and would have inhabited estuarine and freshwater environments.[3] It is the only semionotidid known from the Araripe Basin, except for Lepidotes wenzae.[1]   This article about a prehistoric fish is a stub.
