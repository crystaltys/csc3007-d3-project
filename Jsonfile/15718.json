{"Content: ":"Sumy Oblast (Ukrainian: Сумська́ о́бласть, romanized: Sumska oblast; also referred to as Sumshchyna \u2013 Ukrainian: Су́мщина) is an oblast (province) in the northeastern part of Ukraine. Population: 1,053,402 (2021 est.)[4] The oblast was created in its most recent form, from the merging of raions from Kharkiv Oblast, Chernihiv Oblast, and Poltava Oblast in 1939 by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Sumy. Other important cities within the oblast include Konotop, Okhtyrka, Romny, and Shostka. The oblast has a heavy mix of agriculture and industry, with over 600 industrial locations. Importantly, seven rivers pass through the oblast. The Sumy Oblast is situated in the northeastern part of Ukraine. It is situated on a border of two historical regions of Ukraine \u2014 Cossack Hetmanate (annexed by Russia in the 18th century as Little Russia, previously known as Severia) and Sloboda Ukraine. Elevation is 110\u2013240m above sea level.[5] The area of the oblast (23,800 km2), comprises about 3.95% of the total area of the country. The oblast borders Bryansk Oblast (Russia) on the northeast, Belgorod Oblast and Kursk Oblast (Russia) on the east, Poltava Oblast on the southwest, Kharkiv Oblast on the south, and the Chernihiv Oblast on the west. Seven main rivers flow through the oblast, with the Desna River the largest.[5] The region was created on the ukase of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on 10 January 1939 as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The newly created Sumy Oblast included 12 former raions of Kharkiv Oblast, 17 former raions of Chernihiv Oblast, and 2 former raions of Poltava Oblast. During the World War II in 1941\u201343, it was occupied by the Nazi Germany under administration of the German Wehrmacht. After the German forces were driven out the Soviet Union regained control of the region under jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1965 one of former Chernihiv Oblast raions (Talalaivka Raion) was returned to Chernihiv Oblast. During the 2022 invasion of Ukraine the Sumy Oblast was one of the first regions where Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed.[6][7][8] Parts of the oblast came under Russian occupation during the invasion. On 4 April 2022 Governor of Sumy Oblast Dmytro Zhyvytskyi stated that Russian troops no longer occupied any towns or villages in Sumy Oblast and had mostly withdrawn, while Ukrainian troops were working to push out the remaining units.[9] On 8 April 2022 Zhyvytskyi stated that all Russians troops had left Sumy Oblast.[10] The following historic-cultural sited were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.

Major environmental problems are: soil erosion, pesticide pollution, air and water pollution. The city has a problem of garbage utilization. The only place for pesticide utilization in Ukraine is Shostka, Sumy region. The main industrial activities of the oblast are: chemical mechanical engineering, pumping and energy mechanical engineering, agricultural machine-construction, instrument-making industry and radio electronics, technical equipment production for processing fields of agro-industrial complexes, mining and iron ore production industry, polygraph industry and medicine production, oil and gas processing, chemical production, film and photo material production (See: Svema), and chemical fertilizer production.

Most of Ukraine's oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as \"oblast centers\" (Ukrainian: обласний центр, translit. oblasnyi tsentr). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city: Sumy is the center of the Sums\u2019ka oblast (Sumy Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix \"-shchyna\", as is the case with the Sumy Oblast, Sumshchyna.
