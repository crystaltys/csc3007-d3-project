The voices he adopts comment wryly on a world in which nothing could surprise us, even while everything takes our breath away. The reader finds she has to check the ground beneath her feet.\"[6]","Title":"Kārlis Vērdiņš - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19563","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81rlis_V%C4%93rdi%C5%86%C5%A1"}
