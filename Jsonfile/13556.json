{"Content: ":"Petr Fiala (Czech pronunciation: [ˈpɛtr̩ ˈfɪjala]; born 1 September 1964) is a Czech politician and political scientist who has been the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic since November 2021 and leader of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) since 2014. He previously served as the Minister of Education, Youth and Sports from 2012 to 2013. Previously the rector of Masaryk University in Brno, Fiala was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a non-partisan in the 2013 snap election. He became leader of ODS in January 2014, promising to reform the party and regain public trust after a corruption scandal involving Prime Minister Petr Nečas. Fiala's ODS finished a distant second place in the 2017 legislative election, and continued in the opposition despite multiple offers from the incoming Prime Minister Andrej Babiš to participate in his governing coalition. In 2020, Fiala led the initiative for a centre-right electoral alliance with KDU-ČSL and TOP 09, known as Spolu. He became its candidate for the premiership in the 2021 election, running on a pro-Western and pro-European centre-right platform, focused on fiscal responsibility and closer relations with NATO. The alliance outperformed initial opinion polls and finished first in the election, though with one less seat in the Chamber of Deputies than second-place ANO 2011. Under Fiala's leadership, Spolu formed a coalition government with the Pirates and Mayors alliance, with a comfortable majority of 108 out of 200 seats. He was appointed Prime Minister by President Miloš Zeman on 28 November 2021 and his cabinet took power on 17 December 2021, making him the third oldest person to hold the office, as well as the first with a political science background and the first from Brno. Fiala was born in Brno and was raised in a conservative Catholic family.[1] His father, who was partly of Jewish origin, was a Holocaust survivor.[1][2] He studied history and Czech language at the Faculty of Literature of Masaryk University between 1983 and 1988, and after graduating he worked as a historian in a museum in Kroměříž.[3] In 1996, he became a docent at Charles University in Prague, and in 2002 was named as the first professor of political science in the Czech Republic.[4] In 2004, he became dean of the Faculty of Social Studies at Masaryk University, and in the same year was elected as rector of the university, defeating Jan Wechsler in the third round.[5] Fiala was reelected in 2008 and remained in the position until 2011.[4] While Fiala was rector, Masaryk University increased its enrollment to around 45,000 students, became the most popular Czech university in terms of applications, and created a nationwide system for detecting academic plagiarism.[6] During this period, Masaryk University built a new \u20ac220 million campus for biomedicine, opened a research station in Antarctica, and established the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) using CZK 5.3 billion from the European Structural and Investment Funds. CEITEC launched in 2011.[7] In the 1980s, Fiala was involved in independent civic activism. Between 1984 and 1989 he participated in the so-called underground university, hosting seminars in Brno focused on political philosophy.[8] He was involved in unofficial Christian activities, especially in the circle of secretly consecrated Bishop Stanislav Krátký.[9] Along with other Brno students, he founded the samizdat university magazine Revue 88, published in 1988\u20131989.[10] After November 1989, he continued his publishing and civic activism, working as an editor for magazines such as Proglas, Revue Politika and Kontexty. In 1993, he founded the Centre for the Study of Democracy and Culture (CDK), a civic think-tank. Fiala was criticized for his activities during the 2021 election campaign because the centre was accepting state subsidies.[11] Fiala has been active for a long time in institutions and bodies related to higher education and research in the Czech Republic and abroad. He served as Vice-Chair (2005\u20132009) and Chair (2009\u20132011) of the Czech Rectors' Conference, and at the international level he was a member of the Council of the European University Association (2009\u20132011). In 2007, he was elected by the Parliament to the council of the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, where he served for five years. He is a member of many scientific and academic councils of public and private universities and research institutions in the Czech Republic and abroad. He has received a number of awards for his scientific and academic work; in 2011 he was awarded the Golden Plaque of the President of the Republic.[citation needed] In 2005 he was part of the commission in the competition of Czech and Moravian wines, TOP 77.[12] In September 2011 Fiala served as chief aide for science to Prime Minister Petr Nečas, and on 2 May 2012 was appointed as Minister of Education, Youth and Sports in Nečas's government, remaining in that post until Nečas resigned in 2013. In the 2013 legislative election Fiala was elected as an independent to the Chamber of Deputies. The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) was defeated in the election and Fiala joined the party in November 2013.[13] In 2014 Fiala announced his candidacy for the leadership of ODS, and on 18 January 2014 he was elected as the party's fourth leader. He was re-elected as party leader in 2016. Fiala led ODS into the 2017 legislative election, in which the party finished second with 11% of the vote. Fiala refused to negotiate with ANO 2011 about joining the subsequent government, and ODS remained in opposition.[14] Fiala was reelected leader of ODS in 2018. On 28 November 2017 Fiala was elected Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, receiving 116 of 183 votes.[15] With Fiala as leader, ODS made gains in the 2018 municipal elections and won the Senate election of the same year.[16][17] Fiala was again reelected leader of ODS in 2020. ODS also made gains during the 2020 regional elections.[18] Fiala then started negotiating with KDU-ČSL and TOP 09 about forming an electoral alliance for the legislative election in 2021.[19] ODS, KDU-ČSL and TOP 09 reached an agreement to form an alliance called SPOLU (\"Together\").[20] Fiala became the alliance's candidate for the post of Prime Minister.[21] Ahead of the election, opinion polls suggested that ANO 2011 would win, but in an electoral upset Spolu won the highest number of votes, and opposition parties won a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies.[22] The opposition parties signed a memorandum agreeing to nominate Fiala for the position of Prime Minister.[23] On 8 November, five Czech parties, ranging from the liberal-conservative Civic Democrats to the centre-left liberal Pirate Party, signed a pact to form a new centre-right coalition government and pledged to cut budget deficits.[24] On 9 November, President Miloš Zeman formally asked Fiala to form a new government.[25] On 17 November 2021 Fiala introduced Zeman to his proposed cabinet and Zeman agreed to appoint Fiala the new Prime Minister on 26 November 2021.[26] In November 2021, Fiala confirmed that he would like to continue with the Spolu coalition into the 2022 Senate and municipal elections.[27] On 28 November 2021, President Miloš Zeman appointed Petr Fiala as the 13th Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.[28] Following his appointment, Fiala said he believed his government would bring change and improve the lives of people in the Czech Republic, but that the next year would be difficult for many citizens and the Czech Republic itself.[29] His appointment took effect upon his Cabinet being sworn in, on 17 December 2021. Fiala's government won a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies on 13 January 2022, by 106-86.[30] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Petr Fiala and his government took a tough stance on Russia, pushing for the toughest sanctions against Russia and supporting Ukraine's accession to the European Union. After the invasion, the Czech Republic immediately began supplying weapons and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. On 15 March 2022, Fiala, together with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a display of support for Ukraine.[31] The train journey, described by the media as a \"risky mission\"[32] and an \"extraordinary attempt to demonstrate support\",[33] was the first visit by foreign leaders to Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion,[34] and was hailed by President Zelenskyy as a \"great, brave, correct and sincere step\" after the meeting.[35] Fiala holds conservative[36][37][38] and soft Eurosceptic views,[39] and he opposes political extremism and populism.[40] He opposes same-sex marriage as he stated in his book.[41] In August 2016, Fiala stated that \"radical Islam is at war with Europe\" and that the European Union should not accept migrants who pose a risk.[42] He opposed the withdrawal of Czech soldiers from the war in Afghanistan.[43] Fiala expressed opposition to Russian and Chinese involvement in the construction of the new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.[44] He also claimed that human impact on climate change is \"not entirely clear\", which was met with criticism and accusations of populism from environmental experts.[45] At the beginning of June 2020, a statue in Prague of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in Winston Churchill Square in Žižkov, was spray-painted with the inscription \"He was a racist. Black Lives Matter,\" referring to a wave of protests against police brutality and racism triggered by the murder of George Floyd in the United States. Fiala condemned the vandalism of Churchill's statue, describing Churchill as \"the great democratic politician ... who contributed to the defeat of Adolf Hitler,\" and criticised the graffiti as \"stupid and shameful.\"[46] Prior to the 2021 election, Fiala criticised the European Green Deal, a political initiative of the European Commission to promote the transition to a green economy.[47][48] However, he wrote in May 2021, \"The Green Deal is reality. There is no point in speculating how it could be otherwise. Now we must seize the opportunity to modernize the Czech economy and improve the quality of life by investing in sustainable development, renewable resources and the circular economy.\"[49] Fiala also serves as the chairman of the board of directors of the independent liberal-conservative think tank Pravý břeh. In October 2015, Fiala called for a military invasion by Western ground forces in the Middle East, stating, \"We will not solve the problem of migration and destabilization of the Middle East and North Africa unless we take military action.\" On the other hand, he opposed Russian involvement in the war against Islamic State.[50] In June 2018, commemorating displaced peoples and refugees, German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia and other Central and Eastern European countries after World War II, arguing that there was no moral and political justification for the expulsion. Fiala responded that \"pulling things out of the past with a one-sided interpretation certainly does not help the development of mutual relations.\"[51] In October 2019, he condemned the military aggression of Turkey, a NATO member state, against the Kurds in Rojava in northern Syria, stating that \"the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated significantly since this Turkish military operation in northern Syria.\"[52] He welcomed the victory of the ruling Law and Justice in the Polish parliamentary elections in October 2019, noting that ODS and PiS had been cooperating for a long time in a common European Parliament group.[53] He also stated that he would limit the negative impacts of mining on Czech territory in the Polish Turów brown coal mine near the Czech border.[54] Fiala supports Israel and its policies. He criticized Foreign Minister Tomáš Petříček, Minister of Culture Lubomír Zaorálek and former Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg for their joint statement on 23 May 2020 condemning the planned Israeli annexation of Jewish settlements that Israel had built in the occupied West Bank since 1967.[55] In 2020, he supported the official visit of Czech Senate President Miloš Vystrčil and other Czech senators to Taiwan to express support for the country and its democracy.[56] Petr Fiala is married to biologist Jana Fialová, who he met as a student during the Velvet Revolution. They have three children.[57] Fiala is a Roman Catholic and was baptized in 1986. He played football until the age of 40 and also enjoys tennis, shooting, skiing, swimming, jazz music and James Bond movies.[58]","Title":"Petr Fiala - Wikipedia","KeyID":"13556","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Fiala"}
