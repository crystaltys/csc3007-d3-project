In 1893, it was later expanded and renamed as Catholic Hospital.[2] On 15 December 2019, what would be the first documented COVID-19 patients were admitted here.[3] The hospital was where staff director of the emergency department, Ai Fen, and ophthalmologist Li Wenliang became aware of a viral outbreak that was later linked to the COVID-19 pandemic in China and beyond. Li later contracted the virus from a patient and died at the hospital on February 7, 2020.[4][5]  This article about a hospital in the People's Republic of China is a stub.
