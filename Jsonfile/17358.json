{"Content: ":"Big Mouth is an American adult animated coming-of-age sitcom created by Andrew Goldberg, Nick Kroll, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett provided by Netflix. The series centers on teens based on Kroll and Goldberg's upbringing in suburban New York, with Kroll voicing his fictional younger self. Big Mouth explores puberty while embracing a frankness about the human body and sex.[1] The first season, consisting of ten episodes, premiered on Netflix on September 29, 2017, and the second season was released on October 5, 2018. The third season was preceded by a Valentine's Day special episode on February 8, 2019, and the rest of the third season was released on October 4, 2019. In July 2019, Netflix renewed the series through to a sixth season. The fourth season was released on December 4, 2020, and the fifth season was released on November 5, 2021. A seventh season was ordered in April 2022. Upon its release, the series received critical acclaim, with praise going to the writing, animation, voice acting, musical numbers, humor, and emboldening messages of acceptance. A spin-off series titled Human Resources debuted on March 18, 2022. The series follows a group of teenage 7th graders, including best friends Nick Birch and Andrew Glouberman, as they navigate their way through puberty with struggles like masturbation and sexual arousal all in the Westchester County suburbs of New York. Acting as over-sexualized shoulder angels are the hormone monsters: Maurice (who pesters Andrew and Matthew and occasionally Nick), Connie\u2014the hormone monstress (who pesters Jessi and Nick and occasionally Missy) and Mona (who mainly pesters Missy). Throughout the series, the kids interact with people and objects who are often personified and offer helpful, yet confusing, advice in their puberty-filled lives including the ghost of Duke Ellington, a French-accented Statue of Liberty, a pillow capable of getting pregnant, a bar of Adderall, and even Jessi's own vulva. They seek out their destiny as puberty challenges them mentally and physically. TV writer Andrew Goldberg and screenwriter-directors Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin approached Nick Kroll, Goldberg's best friend since childhood, with the idea to develop a show about going through puberty.[7] Kroll and Goldberg used their divergent pubertal experiences as a centerpiece of the show, because Kroll was a late bloomer while Goldberg went through the physical changes of puberty very early.[8] Many of their lived experiences are featured in the show, such as Kroll's first kiss, and Goldberg's parents waxing his mustache.[7] The show also includes an experience of their childhood friend, Lizzie, who the character of Jessi is based on, getting her first period on a school trip to the Statue of Liberty. According to Kroll in an interview on NPR, Big Mouth \"takes an equal look at what it's like for girls and women, the process of going through puberty, which I think has not been quite as explored in most popular culture.\"[7] Netflix announced they had picked up Big Mouth in June 2016.[9] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that Jenny Slate decided to step down from voicing Missy Foreman-Greenwald so that a Black actress could have the role in the wake of the George Floyd protests.[10] Slate's final time voicing Missy is in the fourth season as she recorded her lines in advance.[11] On August 28, 2020, it was reported that Ayo Edebiri was cast to replace Slate as Missy. Her first appearance as Missy is in \"Horrority House\", the penultimate episode of the fourth season.[3] The first soundtrack album of songs from the TV series was released alongside season three on October 4, 2019.
