{"Content: ":"Stage races One-day races and Classics Other Tony Rominger (born 27 March 1961 in Vejle, Denmark) is a Swiss former professional road racing cyclist who won the Vuelta a España in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and the Giro d'Italia in 1995. He began cycling late, allegedly spurred by competition with his brother. Rominger's strengths were time-trialling, climbing and recuperation. He was a rival to Miguel Indurain in the Tour de France and was placed second in 1993 and won the mountains classification. His three wins in the Vuelta were a record at the time. In 2005, Roberto Heras broke that record but two months later tested positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO and was disqualified. Heras' win has since been reinstated. In 1994 Rominger broke the world hour record twice in a few days. He used Bordeaux velodrome to ride 53.832 km and then 55.291 km, although a track novice.[1] He retired in 1997 after breaking his collarbone at that year's Tour de France. He is the agent of Austrian racing cyclist Matthias Brändle.[2] For his attempt on the Hour Record in 1994, he was coached by Dr Michele Ferrari, who was at the trackside during the ride.
