{"Content: ":"The Hauterivian is, in the geologic timescale, an age in the Early Cretaceous Epoch or a stage in the Lower Cretaceous Series. It spans the time between 132.9 ± 2 Ma and 129.4 ± 1.5 Ma (million years ago). The Hauterivian is preceded by the Valanginian and succeeded by the Barremian.[3] The Hauterivian was introduced in scientific literature by Swiss geologist Eugène Renevier in 1873. It is named after the Swiss town of Hauterive at the shore of Lake Neuchâtel. The base of the Hauterivian is defined as the place in the stratigraphic column where the ammonite genus Acanthodiscus first appears. A reference profile for the base (a GSSP) was officially ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences in December of 2019, and is placed in La Charce, France.[2] The top of the Hauterivian (the base of the Barremian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species Spitidiscus hugii. In the ammonite biostratigraphy of the Tethys domain, the Hauterivian contains seven ammonite biozones:","Title":"Hauterivian - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1022","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauterivian"}
