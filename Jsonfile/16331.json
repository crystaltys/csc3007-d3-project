{"Content: ":"The Salvation Committee for Peace and Order (Russian: Комитет спасения за мир и порядок; Ukrainian: Комітет порятунку за мир та порядок) is the collaborationist supreme administrative and executive authority in the territory of the Kherson Oblast, formed by the constituent Assembly on 10 March 2022[2][1][3][4] following the capture of most of the oblast's territory by the Russian Army in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. After the Russian army captured Kherson and occupied most of the region amidst the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the mayor of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, the former deputy mayor for Social and Humanitarian Affairs Sergey Cherevko, as well as the director of the news agency Tavria News Kirill Stremousov, went to cooperate with Russia. As a result, on March 10, the \"Salvation Committee for Peace and Order\" was formed at the meeting, which declared its goal to maintain law and order in the territories of the region, as well as establishing trade, economic and socio-cultural ties with Russia.[1] According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the activities of the committee encountered constant resistance among the population, and a number of its members were killed by Chief Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) or Ukrainian partisans.[5] So far, one of the most significant actions of the committee is the introduction of the Russian ruble on the territory of the Kherson Oblast.[6]","Title":"Salvation Committee for Peace and Order - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16331","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Committee_for_Peace_and_Order"}
