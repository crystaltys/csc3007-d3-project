{"Content: ":"There was a resurgence of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Variations of homeschooling include micro schools and educational family co-ops. The first usually involves hired professionals to teach a small group of kids (similar to one-room schoolhouses). The second is a parent-organized co-operative where families take turns educating and minding their kids during the week. Both are largely available only to the well-off, as costs in time and money are high. 'Pandemic pod' is the fashionable term used to describe one of these arrangements where all group members agree to participate under well-defined and strictly enforced health rules. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education forced school closures around the world.[1][2] Parents are left to manage their children and it is causing economic,[3][4] educational,[5] political[6][7][8] and psychological distress.[9] A University of California, San Francisco study states that schools can't open safely until COVID-19 transmission in a general population is under control.[10] As schools have been closed to cope with the global pandemic, students, parents and educators around the globe have felt the unexpected ripple effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. While governments, frontline workers and health officials are doing their best slowing down the outbreak, education systems are trying to continue imparting quality education for all during these difficult times. Many students at home/living space have undergone psychological and emotional distress and have been unable to engage productively. The best practices for online homeschooling are yet to be explored, and it is unclear if homeschooling, or any other mitigation effort, can prevent students from falling behind.[11] To mitigate the disruption of school closures, multiple educational structures have been proposed. These terms are used interchangeably and this makes it confusing for parents who are trying to figure out how to organize their lives this fall as most schools will only offer virtual instruction. But basically there are three distinct ideas: pandemic pods, micro schools, and family co-ops.[12][13] A pandemic pods is a small group of people who are all taking similar precautions against catching the virus. A family unit living together is a natural pandemic pod \u2014 everyone is taking responsibility for everyone else's health outcomes. This is also true of roommates and housemates. If one person in a pandemic pod catches the virus, chances are high that the other members of the pandemic pod will get it too.[14] A family co-op is not a pandemic-related entity. Most family co-ops form to ease the economic pressures of child care among several families. Several families get together and agree to share afterschool care of all the kids on certain days. This arrangement frees each set of parents from childcare several times per week. If five families are involved, then each family can take responsibility for all kids once per week. Instead of money, this social arrangement trades in time. Family co-ops is a very old arrangement that has been extensively studied in academic literature.[15][16][17][18][19][20] In early April 2020, Canadian authorities actively encouraged the formation of family bubble \u2014 two families (usually with kids) who would join together and share responsibility for each other.[21] A micro school is some variation on the one-room school where parents hire a teacher to educate their children. Micro schools can be as small as just one family hiring a teacher or a group of parents makes arrangements for all of their children together, splitting the costs of such endeavor. The biggest advantage of micro schools is that parents have total control over their children's education, including the choice of teachers. Micro Schools can vary significantly in costs.[22][23] Some parents created \"school pods\" of multiple families or hired tutors to instruct students by zoom.[24] A pandemic educational family co-op is the cross of all three structures: the micro schools, the family co-ops, and the Pandemic pods. Pandemic educational family co-ops function just like the educational family co-ops but in addition to all of the rest, the pandemic version stresses pandemic precautions within the group. This is the most economical solution for parents that are stuck without \"brick and mortar\" schools to send their kids during the week.[25]","Title":"Homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10909","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic"}
