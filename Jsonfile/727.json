{"Content: ":"The Cambridge Greensand is a geological unit in England whose strata are earliest Cenomanian in age.[1] It lies above the erosive contact between the Gault Formation and the Chalk Group in the vicinity of Cambridgeshire, and technically forms the lowest member bed of the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation.[2] It is a remani√© deposit, containing reworked fossils of late Albian age, including those of dinosaurs and pterosaurs. The lithology is made out of glauconitic marl, described as a \"chalk mud\", containing abundant ostracod, coccolith and foram remains, with a concentration of phosphatic nodules and bones at the base.[1][2]","Title":"Cambridge Greensand - Wikipedia","KeyID":"727","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Greensand"}
