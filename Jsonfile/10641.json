They were also admitted to Karolinska University Hospital for isolation.[20] Uppsala Region confirmed that an individual who had returned from Iran tested positive for the virus, and was in home quarantine.[21] In the morning it was reported that all previous cases in Stockholm Region were travel-related or travel-related person-to-person spread.[25] Screening for coronavirus is included in a statistical sample of patients where routine testing for seasonal influenza is performed.[26] It was reported that one of the cases confirmed on 6 March in Stockholm had sought care at Danderyd Hospital in the Stockholm region on 5 March, and was initially not adequately isolated. The person had caught the virus abroad, but outside known risk areas (at the time South Korea, China, Iran and Northern Italy).[27][28] Contact tracing has begun, with the case marking the second instance of transmission to Sweden from a non-risk area.[28] To date, Stockholm region states that of the 115 confirmed cases in the region, 101 people have been infected in Italy or through contact with a person who has visited Italy, 8 cases have been infected in Iran or through contact with a person who has visited Iran, one person has been infected in another European country, and five cases are still under investigation.[30] One of the Örebro cases confirmed this day is believed to have caught the virus on a trip back from the US, which he/ she arrived back from approximately a week ago. The other two persons are related to this person. Contact tracing has begun around this case,[31] which is the third case of transmission to Sweden from a non-risk area.[32] The Stockholm region press office did not report cases detected on the afternoon of the 8th, instead reporting an additional 32 cases on the 9th.[33] Vietnam suspends its visa waiver program to Sweden and seven other European countries in response to the number of cases.[35] On the same date, Värmland had a total of 21 cases, of which 20 had visited northern Italy, and 19 of these were connected to the same bus tour. One case has been infected in the Netherlands.[41] One of the 21 cases is admitted to Karlstad hospital. The majority of the cases are from the Karlstad area.[42] Further, six new cases were confirmed in Västra Götaland, of which two are in the Skaraborg area.[43] On the same date, the first community transmissions were detected in Sweden. Two persons in the Stockholm area who had no known connection to any of the risk areas or an infected person, were found to be infected, both patients at St. Göran Hospital since Friday 6 March in two different wards.[44] Both cases have been transferred to Huddinge Hospital for further investigation.[45] One of the cases in Västra Götaland was a patient at Kungälv Hospital with signs of respiratory symptoms since approx. a week who was tested for COVID-19 after the decision of the Public Health Agency of Sweden on 4 March. This patient was tested on Sunday 8 March and confirmed positive a day later. The patient was immediately transferred to Sahlgrenska University Hospital and the affected ward at the Kungälv Hospital has been closed for patient admission. Highly exposed staff at Kungälv Hospital have been told to stay home for a while, and contact tracing has begun.[46] On the same date, approx. 30-40 health care staff at St. Göran Hospital in Stockholm were quarantined after having cared for a COVID-19 infected patient. Another patient at the same hospital has been tested and is awaiting results. The hospital immediately went into a state of readiness to handle the situation.[45] In Västra Götaland region, one patient is considered critically ill but stable.[55] After this announcement, Blekinge Health Care Region enforced a total ban on visits by family members and friends at health care and elderly establishments and hospitals in the region.[59] Region Värmland enforced a similar ban on all visits to hospitals and health care establishments in the region.[60] After the announcement of the Public Health Agency of Sweden to protect the elderly and the frail, Stockholm Region decided to change their strategy for testing for COVID-19 to mainly focus on the very ill and not just people who had visited risk areas.[61] Danderyd Hospital also went into a state of readiness due to the situation of the COVID-19 spread in Stockholm.[62] On 11 March Stockholm region decided to only test hospitalised patients from risk groups and health care staff with symptoms. Other regions will follow suit within the coming week. This means the data on the Public Health Agency of Sweden's website is not reflecting the actual infected persons in the country since local transmission has been ongoing since at least early March.[65][66][67]' The same date, Södertälje Hospital went into a state of readiness due to the situation in Stockholm region.[61] The government has banned all gatherings larger than 500 people, under threat of fines and a six-month prison sentence.[68] The same date, the government announced that the qualifying day of sickness ('karensdag') will be temporarily abolished in order to ensure that people feeling slightly ill will stay at home from work. This means that the state will pay sick pay allowance from the first day the employee is absent from work. The decision is effective as of 11 March 2020 and is believed to reduce the virus spreading as well as the burden on the health care system.[69] On the same date, 814 persons in Sweden had been confirmed sick with COVID-19. Stockholm region has since 11 March only tested persons from risk groups and health care staff with symptoms.[65] On 12 March, Scania region decided to do the same, and the other regions in Sweden will follow suit within a week.[66][67] Swedish government recommend schools to make use of distance learning. 6 from Gothenburg area, 2 from Skaraborg area, 3 from Södra Älvsborg area[148] 20 from Gothenburg area, 4 from Skaraborg area, 5 from Södra Älvsborg area[165]","Title":"Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10641","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Sweden"}
