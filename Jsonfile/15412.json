{"Content: ":"Foreign Policy is an American news publication, founded in 1970 and focused on global affairs, current events, and domestic and international policy. It produces content daily on its website and app,[1] and in four print issues annually. Foreign Policy magazine and ForeignPolicy.com are published by The FP Group,[2] a division of Graham Holdings Company (formerly The Washington Post Company). The FP Group also produces FP Events, Foreign Policy's events division, launched in 2012. Foreign Policy was founded in late 1970 by Samuel P. Huntington, professor of Harvard University, and his friend Warren Demian Manshel to give a voice to alternative views about American foreign policy at the time of the Vietnam War.[3][4] Huntington hoped it would be \"serious but not scholarly, lively but not glib\".[5] In early 1978, after six years of close partnership, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace acquired full ownership of Foreign Policy. In 2000, a format change was implemented from a slim quarterly academic journal to a bimonthly magazine. It also launched international editions in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. In September 2008, Foreign Policy was bought by The Washington Post Company (now Graham Holdings Company).[6] In 2012, Foreign Policy grew to become the FP Group\u2014an expansion of Foreign Policy magazine to include ForeignPolicy.com and FP Events.[7] According to its submissions guidelines, Foreign Policy articles \"strike the balance\" between informed specialist research and general readability, and tend to be written in plain rather than \"wonky\" language.[8] Foreign Policy endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. This was the first time in its 50-year history the magazine endorsed a candidate.[9] Since 2003, Foreign Policy has been nominated for eight National Magazine Awards, winning six: three for its print publication and three for its digital publication at ForeignPolicy.com. FP is the only independent magazine that has won consecutive digital national magazine awards every year from being established in 2009.[citation needed] 2003 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2014 2016 The Man on the Operating Table ","Title":"Foreign Policy - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15412","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy"}
