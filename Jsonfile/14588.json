{"Content: ":"The Prime Minister's Office is a ministry of the Government of Sri Lanka. It provides the administrative and institutional framework for the exercise of the duties and responsibilities vested in the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. From 1947 to 1978 it was the most powerful office within the government. However, after the creation of the executive presidency in 1978 the post of Prime Minister became more or less nominal and functions as a deputy to the President, with a few exceptions. Traditionally the Prime Minister maintained offices at his official residence Temple Trees and at the Parliament. The office of prime minister was formed in 1947 with D. S. Senanayake becoming the first Prime Minister of Ceylon. It consisted of a Secretary (Permanent Secretary) and an Assistant Secretary, who were officers of the Ceylon Civil Service, and a Private Secretary, along with clerical and support staff based at the Senate Building along with the Senate, Cabinet office and the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence. Since 1960 the prime minister's office has been based at Sirimathipaya Mansion on Sir Ernest de Silva Mawatha (formerly Flower Road), Colombo which was the former residence of philanthropist Sir Ernest de Silva. The LTTE carried out a suicide bombing at the Prime Minister's Office, on January 5, 2000 in an assassination attempt when a female suicide bomber detonated the bomb outside the Prime Minister's Office, killing 13 civilians and three police officers attached to the PMSD.
