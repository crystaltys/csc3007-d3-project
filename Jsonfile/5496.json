The only U.S. president from New Hampshire was a Democrat, Franklin Pierce, who served from 1853 to 1857. The party has played a pivotal role in the election process for the president of the United States, with New Hampshire holding the first primary in the nation. Local Democrats in New Hampshire have historically had outsized influence in determining their national presidential nominee.[citation needed] The New Hampshire Democratic Party holds both of the state's U.S. Senate seats, and both of the state's seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats hold a minority in the New Hampshire House of Representatives and New Hampshire Senate.

Our beliefs, commitment and policies are grounded in our democratic values of fairness, justice, integrity, freedom, dignity and compassion. We advocate for policies that support strong, healthy and resilient communities and families, and a strong economy with opportunities for all. We believe that honest transparent government promotes a free, democratic society, one that plays a vital role in creating healthy communities with a strong safety net and a vibrant business environment. We believe that essential elements of a robust economy include a healthy, well-educated, well-trained, and fairly-compensated workforce, quality public education, affordable housing and a comprehensive transportation and communication infrastructure.\"[4] New Hampshire holds the first primary in the nation to kick off an election cycle every four years. This is a part of the long process in choosing nominations for both the Democratic and Republican parties. New Hampshire plays a key role in choosing nominees due to the massive amounts of media attention it gets. Being first involves having a huge impact on the process as a whole by setting the bar for latter states. New Hampshire has been a bellwether for politicians seeking election. A weak showing in New Hampshire has caused office seekers to drop out of the race early. In 1952 and in 1968 Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson both drop their reelection campaigns after poor showings in the New Hampshire primary.[5] New Hampshire started holding a primary in 1916 and has held the First in the Nation primary since 1920. At first voters could only vote on delegates to send the party national conventions. It was Richard F. Upton, speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, who amended the law to allow for direct vote of presidential candidates. In 1952 New Hampshire voters started voting for the candidates.[5] This new law inspired the voters of New Hampshire to write in Dwight D. Eisenhower's name as a candidate for the 1952 Republican New Hampshire primary ballot. Eisenhower was able to beat Republican Party leader Robert A. Taft without Eisenhower even going to the state. He would go on to win the nomination and become President.[5] In chronological order: In chronological order: In chronological order:","Title":"New Hampshire Democratic Party - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5496","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Democratic_Party"}
