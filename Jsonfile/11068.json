The source code was published on GitHub on the 25 May.[3] The app only works in Italy, but compatibility with other European contact tracing apps was a goal.[4] Since 19 October 2020 the app supports key-exchanges with the EU Interoperability Gateway and is therefore able to communicate with contact tracing apps of other EU countries.
