{"Content: ":"Norway has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 60 times since making its debut in 1960 and has only been absent twice since then. In 1970, the country boycotted the contest over disagreements about the voting structure, and in 2002, they were relegated. The contest is broadcast in Norway by NRK, which also broadcasts Norway's national selection competition, Melodi Grand Prix. Before 1985, Norway's best result in the contest was Åse Kleveland's third-place in 1966. Norway's three victories in the contest were achieved by Bobbysocks in 1985, Secret Garden in 1995 and Alexander Rybak in 2009. Norway also finished second at the 1996 contest, with former Bobbysocks member Elisabeth Andreassen. Norway has finished last in eleven Eurovision finals, of which four times with \"nul points\". In 2019, Norway became the third televote-winning country to not win the contest (the previous ones being Italy in 2015 and Russia in 2016). Norway has a total of eleven top-five results in the contest, the latest being Margaret Berger's fourth-place in 2013. Norway's first entrant in the contest was Nora Brockstedt in 1960, who finished fourth with the song \"Voi Voi\"; Brockstedt would return the next year with \"Sommer i Palma\", this time placing seventh. Åse Kleveland then finished third in 1966 with \"Intet er nytt under solen\", following which Norway would fail to reach the top ten in fourteen out of their next fifteen attempts, with the exception being Bendik Singers\u2019 seventh place finish in 1973. Before 1985, Norway had only received a top-ten score in six out of twenty-four attempts, and had finished last the same number of times. Bobbysocks gave the country its first victory in 1985, with the song \"La det swinge\". Norway went on to achieve two more top five results over the next ten years, with Karoline Krüger in 1988 and Silje Vige in 1993, who both finished fifth. Norway's second victory came in 1995 with Secret Garden's mainly instrumental Celtic-influenced ethno-piece \"Nocturne\". In 1996, Elisabeth Andreassen, who had won the contest as one half of Bobbysocks, returned to the contest as a solo artist, finishing in second place. In 2003, Jostein Hasselgård came fourth. Norway won for the third time in 2009, with Alexander Rybak's hugely successful song \"Fairytale\". The song\u2019s score of 387 points was the highest ever winning total under the 1975-2015 voting system, and also achieved the biggest ever margin of victory: 492 points in total were distributed between the competing countries in 2009, meaning \"Fairytale\" received 78.7% of the points that could be rewarded. Rybak later returned to the contest in 2018, performing \"That's How You Write a Song\"; he received the highest number of votes of the second semi-final, but ultimately placed fifteenth. He remains the only Norwegian entrant to have won a semi-final, as well as the only two-time semi-final winner in the history of the contest. In 2012, Norway finished last in the final for the eleventh time. Norway has the dubious distinction of finishing last in the Eurovision final more than any other country, and along with Austria, has received \"nul points\" (zero points) in the contest on four occasions; in 1963, 1978, 1981 and 1997. Since the introduction of the semi-final round in 2004, Norway has finished in the top ten seven times. Wig Wam finished ninth with \"In My Dreams\" in 2005, Maria Haukaas Storeng was fifth in 2008 with \"Hold On Be Strong\", Alexander Rybak won in 2009, Margaret Berger was fourth in 2013 with \"I Feed You My Love\", Carl Espen finished eighth in 2014 performing \"Silent Storm\", Mørland & Debrah Scarlett finished eighth in 2015 with \"A Monster Like Me\", Jowst and Aleksander Walmann finished tenth in 2017 with \"Grab the Moment\", Keiino finished sixth in 2019 with \"Spirit in the Sky\", placing first with the televote, and Subwoolfer finished tenth in 2022 with \"Give That Wolf a Banana\". In total, Norway has eleven top-five and twenty-five top-ten finishes in the contest. Additionally, there was an orchestra present at the 1999 national final, conducted by Geir Langslet (the winning song, however, was presented without orchestral accompaniment) and at the 2015 national final, conducted by Anders Eljas.
