{"Content: ":"Dieter Karl Cäsar Wedel (12 November 1939 \u2013 13 July 2022) was a German director. Wedel directed numerous television productions since the late 1960s, among them very successful mini-series like Der große Bellheim [de], Der Schattenmann [de], Der König von St. Pauli [de] and Die Affäre Semmeling. He is considered to be one of Germany's best-known television directors.[1] He also served as the artistic director of the Nibelung Festival in Worms between 2003 and 2014. In the Me Too campaign, Wedel was accused in January 2018 by several actresses of sexual harassment and in the case of actress Jany Tempel even rape.[2] There have been official concerns about the alleged long-time coverup of Wedel's actions because most of his work was done through public broadcasting and received government money. After official investigations against him, Wedel resigned from his post as the artistic director of the Bad Hersfelder Festspiele.[3] Wedel was married to Ursula Wolters for many years, but in the past has also had relationships with other women, among them actresses Hannelore Elsner and Ingrid Steeger. He had six children.[4] Wedel died from leukemia on 13 July 2022 in Hamburg, at the age of 82.[5] Source:[6] (with producing television channel behind the title)","Title":"Dieter Wedel - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17438","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Wedel"}
