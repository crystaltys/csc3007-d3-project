{"Content: ":"An ear saver, also known as mask strain release strap or mask extender,[1] is an accessory to personal protective equipment (PPE), relieves strain on a mask wearer's ears created through the loops of masks. Ear savers were designed as novel items during the COVID-19 pandemic by the open-source hardware community in response to requests sides medical professionals reporting heavy strain on their ears.[2] Ear savers have since been commercialized for a broader population of users as the pandemic wore on.[3][4] Four methods are used to manufacture ear savers: 3D printing, laser cutting, injection molding and sewing (a modified version with crocheted buttons on a headband).[5][6] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the maker movement alone produced more than 2.2 million ear savers.[7] ","Title":"Ear saver - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15248","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_saver"}
