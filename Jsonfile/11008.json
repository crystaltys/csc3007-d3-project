{"Content: ":"Due to its severity, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused countries to send aid, as part of the international responses and management regarding the pandemic. Types of materials aided includes (but are not limited to) masks, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, money, and test kits. It started with aid to China as the virus spreads primarily there, and then internationally as it spreads globally. The destination of the aid ranges from hospitals, COVID-19 healthcare workers, research on the vaccine, to societies vulnerable.

The government then negotiated the delivery of 171,429 packs of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and 30,000 packs of azithromycin from the China National Pharmaceutical Group.[31] The shipment was delivered; the cargo also included more than 1,600,000 masks and 50 ventilators.[32] On 23 March, a team of seven specialist physicians from southern China's Guangxi with medical supplies, including ventilators, medical masks, protective suits, test kits, and infrared temperature sensors, had landed in Phnom Penh to assist tackling the pandemic.[33][34] In April 2020, Vietnam donated Cambodia with $100,000 worth of medical supplies.[35] Cuba, along with Russia and China, sent medical supplies and experts to Italy to deal with its coronavirus outbreak.[19][20] The Czech Republic, along with the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Georgia expressed concerns over Chinese-made masks and test kits,[36] which has been aided to several countries like Afghanistan.

On March 20, 2020, the government announced a stimulus package to provide income support to small businesses, suspension of various taxes, and unemployment benefits to eligible citizens, which took about a month to fully roll out,[42] which were a rapid loan of US$22.4 million from the IMF, in a package aimed at the Eastern Caribbean countries of Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia.[43] President Joko Widodo asked the United States for medical equipment, including ventilators via phone call to President Donald Trump, to which President Trump, on April 24, responded he will provide and also reiterated the intent to strengthen economic cooperation between the two.[44][45] Russia is one of the several countries to send aid to China during its peak of outbreak.[10] It also helped Italy along with Cuba and China in the midst of their peak of outbreak.[19][20] The Vietnamese community in the Ústí nad Labem region raised CZK 140,000 for a donation of a ventilator to a hospital in Ústí nad Labem.[46] The UAE began production of Hayat-Vax, a locally manufactured version of China's Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, in March 2021. Current plans include the production of 2 million doses per month, a majority of which will be exported to low-income countries, particularly Africa and the Middle East, under the WHO's COVAX scheme.[47] By being produced in the UAE, Hayat-Vax is believed to be able to \u201cresolve many of the issues plaguing public acceptance of other vaccines\u201d in Middle Eastern countries.[48]","Title":"International aid related to the COVID-19 pandemic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11008","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_aid_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic"}
