In 2016 Hadiya Khalaf Abbas, Ph.D., representing Deir Ezzor since 2003, became the first woman elected to be the Speaker.[2][3][4][5] In 2017, Hammouda Sabbagh became the first Orthodox Christian to have held the post.[6] The assembly meets at least three times a year and in special occasions called by the council's president or the president of the country.[7] The last elections were held on the 19 July 2020.[8] Several lists were allowed to run across the country but any real opposition is absent. Millions of Syrians living abroad, after fleeing a war that has killed more than 380,000 people, are not eligible to vote.[8] The National Progressive Front won 183 out of 250 seats, 167 of which were for the Ba'ath Party, while 67 Independents held the rest of the seats.
