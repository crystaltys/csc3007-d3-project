{"Content: ":"Carillons, musical instruments of bells in the percussion family, can be found on every inhabited continent. The Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States contain more than two thirds of the world's total, and over 90 percent can be found in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. This list encompasses both traditional and non-traditional carillons.[1] Carillons as defined by the World Carillon Federation[2] and by The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America,[3] are played from a baton keyboard. A traditional carillon contains at least 23 bells, or two chromatic octaves of tuned bells, played from a keyboard which allows control of expression (often in the form of a baton keyboard).[4][5] Israel has one carillon, located at the Jerusalem International YMCA. It was installed and dedicated along with the rest of the newly-constructed building in 1933. Gillett & Johnston cast the original 35 bells, the heaviest of which weighs 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb). In 2018, Royal Eijsbouts cast a 36th bell, weighing 800 kilograms (1,800 lb), for the instrument. It is one of the only carillons in the Middle East.[7][8] Japan has been exposed to carillons through its international relations with Belgium. Since the 1980s, Belgium has used a targeted cultural diplomacy program to expose Japanese artists and students to the carillon, and to encourage them to construct instruments in their country. The city and province of Antwerp and the city of Mechelen provided Osaka with a mobile carillon in 1984. Hasselt donated a carillon to Itami, its sister city, in 1990. Members of the Shinji Shumeikai religious movement, inspired by their trip to St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen, purchased a carillon for Shigaraki in 1990. The Japanese School of Brussels and the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" established educational relations on playing and composing for the carillon.[9] Two Belgian carillon associations \u2013 the Flemish Carillon Association and the Walloon Carillon Association \u2013 count carillons in their respective regions. According to their registries, there are 94 carillons in Belgium: 70 in the Flemish Region, 22 in the Walloon Region, and 2 in the Brussels Capital Region. They are distributed across 77 different cities; several are located within the same city, and two are even within the same building \u2013 at St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen. The population has a wide range in total weights, with bourdons spanning between 30 and 8,180 kilograms (66 and 18,034 lb). They also span a wide range of notes, from 21 (which the Flemish association considers a carillon despite failing its definition that requires at least 23[14]) up to 64. Many carillons were constructed over several centuries by several bellfounders; a minority are constructed entirely by a single bellfounder. The majority of carillons are transposing instruments, and often transpose such that the lowest note on the keyboard is B♭ or C. According to the German Carillon Association, there are 49 carillons located throughout Germany. In 4 cities \u2013 Berlin, Bonn, Cologne, and Hamburg \u2013 there are at least two. Germany has two mobile carillons, \"headquartered\" in Passau and Rostock. The largest carillon by number of bells is located in Halle (Saale) and has 74.[48] The association, unlike Towerbells.org,[1] does not count carillons that have any component of its action electrified or that are not playable with a traditional baton keyboard.[49] Heiligenkreuz Abbey, which claims to be the only Cistercian institution that owns a carillon, acknowledges that the tradition of playing carillons is not popular in Austria.[127] Annual concerts since 1999 during the Gdańsk Carillon Festival. See also Traveling carillons below. Selections of notable carillons in the United States: Traveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and keyboard are installed on a frame that allow it to be transported. These carillons are often constructed by bellfounders for advertising purposes, though several exist solely to perform across the world. According to a count by the World Carillon Federation, there are 18 existing mobile carillons headquartered in 11 countries.[173] Instruments with bells defined as non-traditional carillons by The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America,[3] played from an electric keyboard or by any automatic mechanism","Title":"List of carillons - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5822","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_carillons"}
