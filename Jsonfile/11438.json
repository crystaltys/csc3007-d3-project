Following the 2020 Malaysian political crisis, Noor Hisham took over from press briefings after new Health Minister Adham Baba gave a widely criticized first briefing where he falsely claimed that warm water can protect from COVID-19.[4] Noor Hisham's briefings were praised for their calm and clarity during the crisis.[9] In April 2020, he was picked to join an international coalition dedicated to clinical research involving COVID-19.[15][16] The China Global TV Network (CGTN), had recognised Dr Noor Hisham as among the \u201ctop doctors\u201d of the world alongside America's Dr Anthony Fauci and New Zealand's Dr Ashley Bloomfield for the handling of COVID-19 pandemic approach.[12][17] He also was named again among the COVID-19 heroic trio by Singaporean news outlet, The Independent.[18] On 4 July 2020, Noor Hisham was awarded the '2019 Most Notable Alumni' by his alma mater UKM's Medical Faculty.[19] On 17 July, he received the BrandLaureate Award 2020 for Outstanding Brand Leadership along with the 'Certificate of Recognition and Appreciation' for Ministry of Health by the World Brand Foundation.[20][21] On 19 August, he was named as the recipient of the national level Maal Hijrah Figure Award 2020AD/1442AH.[22] Noor Hisham received the Rotary Club's Paul Harris Fellowship, the highest honour given by them to individuals who have contributed to good causes, from the club Kuala Lumpur chapter on 13 September.[23] On 18 December, women's magazine Nona honoured him with a special Nona Frontliner Award during the Nona Superwoman Award 2020 presentation.[24][25] On 20 December, he was presented a special award during the Anugerah MeleTOP Era 2020 (AME 2020) jointly hosted by Astro's both MeleTOP television entertainment programme and ERA radio station.[26][27] On 18 March 2021, a year since the first COVID-19 pandemic Movement Control Order (MCO) imposed, in which he spearheaded the fight against, Noor Hisham received the Ibn Khaldun Merit Award by International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) from its chancellor Raja Permaisuri Agong Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah.[28][29] Noor Hisham received the International Surgical Fellowship Award from the International Society of Surgery (ISS) during the 'Virtual Surgical Week' (VSW 2021) held from 30 August to 3 September.[30] On 15 December, the Nona magazine presented Noor Hisham again, who had received 2020 Nona Superwoman Award a year earlier, for the main 2021 Nona Superhero Award this time.[31][32] On 18 December, Noor Hisham awarded 2021 Leadership Award by the Malaysia Public Relations and Communication Association (PRCA) to recognises and honours his dedication in giving interviews to keep the public updated.[33] In October 2020, Noor Hisham appeared as an animated character along with characters from BoBoiBoy franchise in a one-minute public service announcement to remind Malaysians to take steps to prevent COVID-19.[34][35] In 2018, Noor Hisham has criticised for his politically inclined retweets, which was viewed as pro-Barisan Nasional (the then-ruling coalition, during the 2018 general election (GE14) campaign). One of his retweets was a message by former Prime Minister Najib Razak's original tweet that showed a photo announcing the groundbreaking ceremony of the Hospital Kajang women and children's complex, in which it contained a verse of his hopes for BN's return to the state power of Selangor. Prior to that, he had also retweeted another message from Najib that showed a picture of Najib on a visit to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital with mothers and their new babies, in which Noor Hisham also said that BN would implement more for mothers and children if it continues to be given the mandate.[36] Noor Farida Ariffin, a spokesperson for G25 (a group of eminent ex-civil servants of Malaysia), said that Noor Hisham was abusing his position, as public servants were not supposed to campaign for any political party. A founding member of G25 and former Treasury secretary-general, Mohd Sheriff Kassim said that the Ministry of Health should lodge a complaint against Noor Hisham to the Election Commission (EC).[36] The electoral reform group, Bersih 2.0, also criticised Noor Hisham by saying that he was in breach of public service regulations. He was named in Bersih's 'Hall Of Shame' together with Najib. Bersih also said that they were appalled that the Ministry of Health allows its Facebook page to promote BN's manifesto during the GE14 campaign.[37] Noor Hisham allegedly flouted the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the ongoing conditional MCO after photos of him and other family members standing closely without any face masks for a photo-op during a wedding reception of his daughter, Khairin Afiqah, which was held at the BoraOmbak Marina Hall, Putrajaya, on 21 March 2021, were widely circulated online. As a result, many netizens have questioned Noor Hisham, as an icon should have set a good example for the public by strictly observing the SOP himself during the COVID-19 pandemic.[38][39] In July 2021, the former health DG, Tan Sri Dr Mohamed Ismail Merican, rebuked Noor Hisham as a \"toothless tiger\" for not having real authority and not being effective in leading the nation's COVID-19 pandemic management by failing to be firm with decisions as well as being pressured by politicians.[40] Dr Mohamed Ismail, who was the former position holder in charge of the 2003 SARS outbreak, opined that if politicians tried to interfere, they would be told to stay calm and stop meddling.[41] Noor Hisham is married to Nik Suwaida Nik Mohyideen and has six children; four sons and two daughters.[42][24] Noor Hisham having a lanky physique is an avid sportsman since his younger days.[7] He was a school athlete, played football during university days and enjoys scuba diving including underwater photography.[9] His hidden singing talent was revealed after an old video clip of him rendering the Shanghai Beach or Seung Hoi Tan (上海灘), a famous 1980s Cantopop song, resurfaced on social media.[43][44] He is also known as a multilingual, being able to communicate fluently in English, Malay, several Chinese dialects, including his native Foochow colloquial, and even a little Tamil.[5][9]","Title":"Noor Hisham Abdullah - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11438","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noor_Hisham_Abdullah"}
