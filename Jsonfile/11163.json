{"Content: ":"The Sanofi\u2013Translate Bio COVID-19 vaccine, also known as MRT5500 or VAW00001, was a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio.[2][3] The development was stopped in September 2021.[4] In June 2020, Sanofi, after lagging behind its competitors, \"accelerated\" the development of the vaccine via the smaller biotech firm Translate Bio, with a US$425 million partnership.[5] Development of the vaccine halted in September 2021, with Sanofi citing the difficulty of running placebo-controlled studies with other mRNA vaccines (such as Pfizer's and Moderna's) already on the market. Despite this, the company reported \"promising results\" in its initial trials.[4] Sanofi has continued testing its recombinant protein vaccine, developed collaboratively with GlaxoSmithKline, to serve as a booster dose for other COVID-19 vaccines.[4] This article about COVID-19 vaccines is a stub.
