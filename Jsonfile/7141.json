{"Content: ":"The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition, held every year by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. This page is a list of cities and venues that have hosted the contest, one or more times. Having hosted the contest six times, Dublin, Ireland holds the record for having hosted the contest most often. It is followed by London and Luxembourg (each hosted 4 contests), then Copenhagen and Stockholm (each hosted 3 contests). The contest has frequently been held in a capital city: the first four editions (between 1956 and 1959) are to date the longest span of consecutive editions without a capital hosting the event, only followed by the three between 2019 and 2022 (the 2020 contest having been cancelled). The tradition of the winning country hosting the following year's event was established in 1958, held in the Netherlands.[70][71][72] A number of exceptions to this rule have occurred since, typically when the winning country had already hosted the event in the recent past. These exceptions are listed below:[73] With Australia's invitation to participate in the contest in 2015, it was announced that should they win the contest, Australian broadcaster SBS would co-host the following year's contest in a European city in collaboration with an EBU member broadcaster of their choice.[79][80] The Host City Insignia is a rotating trophy awarded to cities hosting the Eurovision Song Contest, proposed jointly by the city of Helsinki, the Finnish broadcaster Yle and the EBU in conjunction with the 2007 contest. The trophy is a large key ring to which the host cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city. The Host City Insignia Exchange usually takes place in conjunction with the Semi-Final Allocation Draw. The insignia is then traditionally put on display in a public place, such as the City Hall or another venue of local significance, for the remainder of the year.[81] The concept and fob were designed by the ANTEEKSI team and the key ring by jewellery designer Taru Tonder. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: \"Eurovision Song Contest Host City\", all host cities up until 2006 and a stamp: \"Helsinki 2007\" with the initials of the insignia designers. Additionally, the fob has a picture of the Helsinki Senate Square attached to the ring.[82][83][84] Since the introduction of the two semi-finals system in 2008, a drawing has been held to determine in which semi-final a country would participate, as well as in which semi-final a country would vote in. Each year, either five or six countries are exempt from the drawing for competing in the semi-finals: the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and the host country, if the host is not one of the \"Big Five\". In 2015, the number of countries exempt was seven, as Australia joined the other six exempt countries as a special guest contestant. Regardless if a country is exempt from competing in the semi-finals, all participating countries are allotted a semi-final in which to vote. Previously, the running order has been determined at a dedicated event. This has been made redundant following the implementation of producer-created running orders in 2013. An official Opening Ceremony with a red carpet procession has been held since 2009 at a venue in the host city. Previously a welcome reception was typically held for all participating artists and hosted by the mayor of the host city.[98]","Title":"List of Eurovision Song Contest host cities - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7141","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eurovision_Song_Contest_host_cities"}
