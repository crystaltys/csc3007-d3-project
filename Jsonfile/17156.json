{"Content: ":"The men's coxed four competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics took place at Mei Bay, Helsinki, Finland. It was held from 20 to 23 August and was won by the team from Czechoslovakia.[1] There were 17 boats (85 competitors) from 17 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event.[2] The gold medal was Czechoslovakia's first medal in the men's coxed four. Switzerland earned its third consecutive silver medal, and sixth medal in seven Games dating back to 1920 (the only Games in that time where the Swiss team did not win a medal was 1932, when no Swiss boat competed). The reigning champion United States took bronze. This was the ninth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.[2] The Italian team was regarded as the slight favourite for the event; they had won gold at the European Rowing Championships in 1949, silver in 1950, and gold again in 1951, with the team having changed between competitions. Of the New Zealand team that had won the 1950 British Empire Games, three rowers were in the 1952 Olympic event: Ted Johnson, John O'Brien, and Colin Johnstone. The Danish team was made up of the 1950 European Rowing Championships winners: Niels Kristensen, Ove Nielsen, Peter Hansen, Bent Blach Petersen, and Eivin Kristensen. The New Zealand and Italian team met in the repechage and New Zealand was eliminated. The Czechoslovakian team dominated the competition and won every round. In the final, they defeated the Swizz quad, while the team from the USA\u2014the winners of the 1948 Olympic competition\u2014won bronze.[1] Egypt and the Soviet Union each made their debut in the event. France and the United States both made their seventh appearance, tied for most among nations to that point. The coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.[3] Based on a previous decision, each boat raced a minimum of two races before it could be eliminated.[4] The competition featured five rounds (three main rounds and two repechages). All times are Eastern European Summer Time (UTC+3) Four heats were rowed on 20 July.[5] Three of the heats had four teams and one had five teams, with the first two teams to qualify for the semifinals, and the remaining teams progressing to the round one repechage.[6] Three heats were rowed in the round one repechage on 21 July,[7] with the first team to qualify for the semi-final repechage.[8] Two heats were rowed in the semifinals on 21 July,[7] with the first team to qualify for the final, and all other teams to progress to the semifinal repechage.[9][10] Three heats were rowed in the semifinals repechage on 22 July,[7] with the winning teams progressing to the final.[10] Five teams reached the final, which was decided in one race held on 23 July.[7][11] While conditions had been favourable on the first three days of racing, the day the finals were held saw wind at considerable force. This wind died down later, but the coxed four was the first race of the day and the results were affected by the strong wind.[4]","Title":"Rowing at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's coxed four - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17156","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_at_the_1952_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_coxed_four"}
