{"Content: ":"Dignified death, death with dignity, dying with dignity or dignity in dying is an ethical concept that refers to the end-of-life process avoiding suffering and maintaining control and autonomy.[1] In general, it is usually treated as an extension of the concept of dignified life, in which people retain their dignity and freedom until the end of their existence.[2] Although a dignified death can be natural and without any type of assistance,[2] the concept is frequently associated with the right to die,[3] as well as with the defense of the legalization of practices such as voluntary euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, terminal sedation or the refusal of medical assistance.[4] According to its defenders, the possibility of this type of practices would be what would guarantee a dignified death, keeping free decisions until the last moment and avoiding an unnecessary agony.[2][5]","Title":"Dignified death - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12409","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignified_death"}
