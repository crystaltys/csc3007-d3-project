{"Content: ":"Denys Hennadiyovych Prokopenko (Ukrainian: Дени́с Генна́дійович Прокопе́нко, romanized: Denýs Hennádiyovyč Prokopénko, IPA: [deˈnɪs ɦeˈnːad\u207dʲ\u207eijoʋɪt͡ʃ prokoˈpɛnko] ;[a]) is a Ukrainian military officer, a Lieutenant Colonel in the National Guard of Ukraine, and Commander of the Azov Regiment.[1][2][3] Since 2014 until his capture in May 2022 by Russian forces, he fought against Russia and pro-Russian separatist forces in the Donbas in the ongoing Russo\u2013Ukrainian War.[4] In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prokopenko rose as a leader defending Mariupol from the Russian siege. For his leadership role on the frontlines of the conflict, he was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in March 2022.[5][6] Prokopenko is also known as Redis (Ukrainian: Ре́діс, romanized: Rédis, IPA: [ˈrɛd\u207dʲ\u207eis][b]) an old football fan nickname which became his military call sign. His subordinates are reported to address him informally as \u201cBrother Redis\u201d or \u201cComrade Redis\u201d («Дру́же Ре́діс», \u201cDrúže Rédis\u201d, [ˈdruʒe ˈrɛd\u207dʲ\u207eis]).[4][7] Denis Prokopenko is of ethnic Finnic Karelian ancestry.[1] His grandfather was the sole member of his family to survive serving in the Finnish Defence Forces when the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Russo\u2013Finnish Winter War of 1939 and 1940.[4] The Finns fought off the Red Army to preserve national independence, but the resulting Moscow Peace Treaty forced Finland to cede to Russia much of historic Finnish Karelia\u2014leaving the displaced inhabitants and their descendants with questions about the return of their lost homeland.[8][9] Consequently, the young Prokopenko today considers his fight to defend Ukraine against Russian imperialism from Moscow a personal matter, closely intertwined with his own family history:[4] \"It feels like I continued the same war, only on another section of the front, a war against the occupation regime of the Kremlin. My grandfather had such a terrible hatred for communism, for Bolshevism, for the Sovok... Can you imagine what it's like to lose your family? I mean, all his brothers perished, his kinfolk...\". He graduated from the Department of Germanic Philology at Kyiv National Linguistic University, where he earned a degree with a specialty in teaching English.[4] He also played sports, and was one of the enthusiastic football fans (known as \"ultras\") of the football club Dynamo Kyiv.[10] Since 11 July 2014, he has participated in the War in Donbas, originally as a simple grenade launcher, later taking command of a platoon, company, then becoming the commander of the Azov Regiment in July 2017, becoming the youngest commander in the history of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.[11][4] The Azov Battalion has drawn criticism for its involvement in war crimes, and use of Nazi insignia such as the Black Sun motif originally designed for Heinrich Himmler.[12] a July 2016 interview, Redis described the improvement in military capabilities he oversaw in his troops: \u201cOur mission is to build a new kind of army. Although we lost a lot of experienced guys from the old squad, we've grown in quantity and quality. Discipline and combat efficiency have improved. We used to run with bobby pistols and sawn-off shots; now we have opportunities to work with tactical tank groups, armored vehicles, artillery support. We gradually developed our military science doctrine\u2014starting with practice, not theory. In the course of training and fighting, the lads mastered tactics and small arms proficiency. Many new possibilities opened for us: we can operate independently on the frontlines, free of other subunits that constantly let us down in combat operations.\u201d[7][13] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prokopenko recorded a video message on 7 March 2022 in which he called for closing the skies over Ukraine to help avert humanitarian collapse in Mariupol, since \u201cthe enemy is breaking the rules of the war by shelling the civilian people and destroying the infrastructure of the city; the enemy is subjecting Mariupol to another genocide.\u201d[2][14] On 19 March 2022, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the title Hero of Ukraine to the commanders of two units that led the defense of Mariupol: Prokopenko and the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, Colonel Volodymyr Baranyuk. Major Denis Prokopenko received the highest honor \u201cfor bravery, for effective tactics to repel enemy attacks, and for protection of the hero city of Mariupol.\u201d[6][10] On 12 April 2022, Prokopenko appeared in a video message, to report on charges that Russian chemical weapons had been dropped onto Mariupol in a drone attack: \u201cyesterday the occupiers used a poisonous substance of unknown origin against military and civilians in Mariupol. The epicenter of the attack was not near the people, so contact with the substance was minimal, which possibly saved lives\u2014but there are still consequences. Currently it's impossible to find out what substance poisoned people, because we are under complete blockade, and the site of the attack is under fire by the Russians to hide evidence of their crime.\u201d Regardless of the sudden international focus on the chemical attack, he went on to claim that thousands of civilians in the city had been killed and continued to be slaughtered by constant ongoing Russian airstrikes, naval bombardment, heavy flamethrower systems, artillery, and phosphorus munitions.[15][non-primary source needed] On 13 April 2022, it was confirmed by the official Twitter account of the Azov regiment that Prokopenko was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.[16] On 11 May 2022, Pope Francis met in the Vatican with the wives of Azov Regiment soldiers Kateryna Prokopenko and Yulia Fedosyuk.[17][18][19][20][21] On 16 May 2022, a social media post was released by Prokopenko stating: \"In order to save lives, the entire Mariupol garrison is implementing the approved decision of the Supreme Military Command and hopes for the support of the Ukrainian people.\" This statement follows Russia's decision to \"evacuate\" wounded Ukrainian soldiers from the Azovstal plant and for them to be taken to the DPR-controlled town of Novoazovsk for treatment.[22] On 20 May 2022, he surrendered to the Russian military along with the last defenders of the Azovstal plant, after stating in a final video message on Telegram: \"The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city.\" Since the Russian Duma is currently attempting to classify Azov as a terrorist organization, the question of whether Russia considers Prokopenko as a prisoner of war (POW) remains in doubt.[23][24] On 24 May, his wife Kateryna confirmed that he was in Russian captivity and that she had been able to talk to him on the phone.[25] He is married to Kateryna Prokopenko.[27]","Title":"Denys Prokopenko - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16418","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denys_Prokopenko"}
