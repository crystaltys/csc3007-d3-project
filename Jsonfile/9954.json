{"Content: ":"Primera Hora is a daily newspaper of Puerto Rico. It was established on November 17, 1997 by Carlos Nido and HÃ©ctor Olave. Distributed free of charge through a print edition from Monday to Friday, readers can get Primera Hora through subscription, in establishments and at traffic lights throughout the island. Reaching more than 200,000 people with its regionalized distribution, Primerahora.com is also the second most visited local news website in Puerto Rico.[1] Primera Hora also fleshed out questions raised by Puerto Rican politicians in 2002,[2] by publishing research findings and even conducting its own research during a national controversy over reggaeton music and perreo, a popular dance move associated with reggaeton. Primera Hora conducted its minor survey on how dancing perreo to reggaeton music affects youth, specifically young women in Puerto Rico.[3] This Puerto Rico\u2013related article is a stub.
