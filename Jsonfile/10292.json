{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Zimbabwe in March 2020. Some of Zimbabwe's provinces, especially Manicaland, Masvingo and Mashonaland East, also struggled with a malaria outbreak at the same time. Though malaria is treatable, the healthcare system faces drug shortages and increased strain with the spread of COVID-19.[3] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[4][5] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[6][7] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[8][6] Model-based simulations for Zimbabwe indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t has been stable below 1.0 since June 2021.[9]  Before there were any confirmed cases in the country, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had declared a national emergency, putting in place travel restrictions and banning large gatherings.[85][86] The country's defence minister, Oppah Muchinguri caused controversy by stating the coronavirus could be a divine punishment on Western nations for imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe.[87] On 23 March, President Mnangagwa announced additional measures: On 27 March the government announced that the country would go into a nationwide lockdown for 21 days from 30 March onwards.[92] The Victoria Falls viewing sites have also been closed as part of Zimbabwe and Zambia lock down measures.[93] Some of the restrictions of the 21-Day Lock down have been reversed; supermarkets are now allowed to sell alcohol once again.[93] On 18 April the Republic of Zimbabwe celebrate its 40th independence day under lock down for the first time in the country's history.[94] During the lockdown 201 malaria outbreaks were reported, 90 were controlled resulting in 131 people dying.[95] The IMF estimated that the Zimbabwean economy would probably contract by 7.4% in 2020 largely due to the impact of the pandemic.[96] Prevention and treatment was negatively impacted by a medical workers strike in the first quarter of 2020 due to a lack of PPE.[97]  On 22 February 2021, Zimbabwe launched their COVID-19 vaccination program using the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine.[98] As of 17 June 2022, 6,260,228 people have received their first dose, 4,598,703 have received their second dose, and 851,874 have received a third dose.[2] As of 11 June 2022, 41.5% of the total population received at least one dose.[99] Corruption is alleged to exist within the public vaccination program, with the priority for receiving vaccines being given to those willing to pay bribes to hospital staff, and members of Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU-PF. Vaccines are reportedly available within the private health care system at a cost of approximately $40 USD.[100]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10292","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Zimbabwe"}
