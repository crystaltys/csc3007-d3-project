{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Angola is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Angola in late March 2020, with the first two cases being confirmed on 21 March.[4] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[5][6] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[7][8] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[9][7] Model-based simulations for Angola indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t exceeded 1.0 until September 2020 but diminished to around 0.5 in the second half of 2021.[10]  Media related to COVID-19 pandemic in Angola at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Angola - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10282","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Angola"}
