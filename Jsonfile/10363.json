{"Content: ":"This article documents the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Tibet Autonomous Region. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] Although there were no suspected and confirmed cases in Tibet at the time, an Autonomous Region leadership group was established on January 27, with the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the chairman of the Autonomous Region as the group leaders, to respond to the novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the same time, Tibet declared a Level II major public health emergency response.[8] Starting on the same day, all tourist sites in Tibet were temporarily closed,[9] and all persons entering Tibet were required to be quarantined for 14 days in designated places.[10] On 29 January, Tibet escalated its major public health emergency response level to Level I.[11] On 29 January, Tibet reported its first suspected cases, a person from Suizhou, Hubei, who took a train from Wuchang railway station to Lhasa on 22\u201324 January.[12] On 30 January, the case was confirmed.[1] On 12 February, the patient was discharged after recovery from the Third People's Hospital of Tibet Autonomous Region. Thus, the number of active confirmed and suspected cases in Tibet decreased to zero.[2]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Tibet - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10363","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Tibet"}
