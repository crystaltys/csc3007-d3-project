{"Content: ":"Proceedings of the Royal Society is the parent title of two scientific journals published by the Royal Society. Originally a single journal, it was split into two separate journals in 1905: The two journals are the Royal Society's main research journals. Many celebrated names in science have published their research in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, including Paul Dirac,[1] Werner Heisenberg,[2] Ernest Rutherford,[3] and Erwin Schr√∂dinger.[4] All articles are available free at the journals' websites after one year for Proceedings B and two years for Proceedings A. Between 11 and 70 years after publication they are behind a paywall, and after that they enter the free digital archive.[5][6] Authors may have their articles made immediately open access (under Creative Commons license) on payment of an article processing charge. The journal started out in 1800 as the Abstracts of the Papers Printed in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London as an extension of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society which was first published in 1665.

As of 2017[update], the two series are called  Proceedings of the Royal Society A publishes peer-reviewed research articles in the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences.

The journal publishes predominantly research articles and reviews, as well as comments, replies, and commentaries. In 2005, Biology Letters (originally a supplement to Proceedings B), was launched as an independent journal publishing short articles from across biology.
