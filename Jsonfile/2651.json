{"Content: ":"The Battle of Aclea occurred in 851 between the West Saxons led by Æthelwulf, King of Wessex and the Danish Vikings at an unknown location in Surrey. It resulted in a West Saxon victory. Little is known about the battle and the most important source of information comes from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which recorded that: Aclea means Oak Field, as Asser explained. This should survive as Oakley and there are many examples of that name in England, but none survive in Surrey[2] except possibly for Ockley Common near Thursley.[3] Coordinates: 51°08\u203253\u2033N 0°21\u203247\u2033W﻿ / ﻿51.148°N 0.363°W﻿ / 51.148; -0.363  This article about a battle is a stub.
