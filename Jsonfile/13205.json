{"Content: ":"The August 2011 stock markets fall was the sharp drop in stock prices in August 2011 in stock exchanges across the United States, Middle East, Europe and Asia. This was due to fears of contagion of the European sovereign debt crisis to Spain and Italy, as well as concerns over France's current AAA rating,[1] concerns over the slow economic growth of the United States and its credit rating being downgraded. Severe volatility of stock market indexes continued for the rest of the year. Stocks Falling In August 2011, investors lost trillions due to many different variables causing the stock market to fall.[2] There was a debt crisis in Europe, uninspiring economic news, and a bust to U.S. credit rating which caused a fear of double dip recession.[3] August 4, 2011 was a below average day in the stock market but ended in the worst day since 2009.[4] Investors wanted to find safer ways to invest their money due to the 11 percent stock market fall in two weeks.[5] As the market was falling, the United States and Europe were failing to fix the economic crisis occurring.[6] Investors were moving their money to treasury bonds to increase the security of their investments.[7] Leading to the European Central Bank trying to recover the stock market drop which was unsuccessful.[8] This scared investors and did the opposite of what was wanted.[9] The Central bank intervened by buying bonds from small countries, but not Italy and Spain.[10] The Central bank would soon be overwhelmed by the huge amount of debt in these two countries.[11] Investors were more unnerved due to the European Commission President, Manuel Barroso.[12] Instead of downplaying the market crash he confirmed the fears of the stock market crash due to political paralysis.[13] There were tons of stocks in Europe being sold and then continues in the United States.[14] By Thursday, it caused more than 15 billions stocks to change hands.[15] Investors started to loss their faith in how reliable the corporate profiles were.[16] All of this resulted in the S.&.P 500 to fall 10.7 percent from July, 22 when it was at 1,345.[17] Standard & Poor's downgraded America's credit rating from AAA to AA+ on 6 August 2011 for the first time.[18] The US had a AAA rating since 1941.[19] Standard and Poor's said that it could go down further than AA+,[20][21] with Moody's also warning of a potential downgrade of the government's credit rating.[22] Gold increased in value up to US$1750.[23][24] Gold is typically considered a secure investment in times of economic uncertainty,[25] with other investors and traders also investing in foreign currencies, such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, also considered to be safe investments.[26] Japan: On 4 August, the Japanese government intervened in currency markets in order to combat the overvalued state of the Yen by spending between ¥400 billion and ¥500 billion to help achieve and maintain an exchange rate of roughly US$1 to ¥80, a level seen as crucial to help exporters compete.[27] Thailand: On 8 August, the SET Index dropped by 15.19 points (1.39%) to 1,078.19 points, with the SET50 Index and SET100 Index revealing a drop of 11.04 points (1.45%) to 750.11 points and 24.55 points (1.48%) to 1,636.53 points respectively.[28] Trading on 9 August saw greater slides, with the SET Index revealing 35.65 points (3.31%) down to 1,042.54 points, and similar results from the SET50 Index showing 25.19 points (3.36%) down to 724.92 points and the SET100 Index with 56.10 points (3.43%) down to 1,580.32 points.[29] France: The CAC 40 fell by 20% in two weeks.[30] It fell by 5.5% on 18 August 2011.

On 6 August, the market fell to its lowest point of 11,670.96, and by 15 August, it had recovered almost all of its losses going back to 12,693.61. This was partly due to the high number of resource companies listed on the TSX gaining due to soaring commodity prices such as gold.
