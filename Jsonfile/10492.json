{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Metro Manila is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus reached Metro Manila on January 30, 2020, when the first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed in Manila. Metro Manila is the worst affected region in the Philippines, where most cases are recorded in the country. A state of calamity and community quarantine have been in place in the region since March 15.[1] After a month of no new cases in the country, the first case of someone without travel history abroad was confirmed on March 5, a 62-year-old male who frequented a Muslim prayer hall in San Juan City, raising suspicions that a community transmission of COVID-19 is already underway in the Philippines. The man's wife was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 on March 7, which was also the first local transmission to be confirmed.[2][3] As of November 1, 2021, there have been 852,483 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila, with 10,277 deaths.[4] The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was recorded in Metro Manila on January 30, 2020. It involved a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the origin of the disease, who arrived in Manila after travelling to Cebu City and Dumaguete in central Philippines from Hong Kong.[5] Three days later, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that a second Chinese national tested positive for COVID-19, identified as the 44-year-old male companion of the first confirmed patient.[6] Both patients received treatment at Manila's San Lazaro Hospital with the latter being reported to have died from the disease on February 2, becoming the first known fatality outside China.[6] On March 6, the DOH reported the first case of local community transmission of the deadly virus, a 62-year-old Filipino man from suburban Cainta, Rizal, just east of Metro Manila, with no prior travel history to affected countries.[7] He and his 59-year-old Filipino wife were initially admitted to the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in San Juan where they were diagnosed with the virus before being transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa where they both died on March 11.[8] On March 12, 2020, following the declaration of a public health emergency, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire capital region under community quarantine for 30 days starting March 15, 2020.[9] Most areas in Metro Manila have also issued curfews to help limit the spread of the virus.[10] On March 16, an enhanced community quarantine order was issued by the president covering Metro Manila and the entire island of Luzon.[11] On April 7, DOH secretary Francisco Duque reported that Metro Manila's COVID-19 cases continued to rise as 80 percent of the country's 3,764 confirmed cases were from the region. Duque also identified the cities with the most number of cases by the third week of the mass quarantine: Quezon City with 583, Manila with 221, Makati with 160, Parañaque with 155, and San Juan with 134 confirmed cases. The cities with the most reported deaths so far were identified as Quezon City with 34, Manila with 30, San Juan with 24, Pasig with 15, and Caloocan and Parañaque with 14 fatalities each.[12] On the same day, President Duterte announced that the Luzon-wide quarantine measures have been extended to April 30.[13] It was further extended up to May 15. A modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) was then applied to NCR, Laguna, and Cebu City afterwards, while GCQ was raised to 41 provinces and 10 cities with moderate risk.[14][15] The first suspected case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was reported in January 2020. The case was that of a 5-year-old boy in Cebu, who arrived in the country on January 12 with his mother.[16] At that time, the Philippines has no capability to conduct tests to confirm suspected COVID-19 cases.[17][18] The boy tested positive for \"non-specific pancoronavirus assay\" by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa, and samples from the boy were sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing to determine the specific coronavirus strain.[16] The boy tested negative for COVID-19 but several suspected cases were reported in various parts of the country.[19] The RITM developed capability to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-19 cases. It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30.[17][18] On the same day, the Philippines confirms its first case of COVID-19 in Metro Manila and the entire country, a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 21.[20] She was hospitalized at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.[5] She sought a consultation due to a mild cough, and was already asymptomatic at the time of the announcement. The second case was confirmed on February 2, a 44-year-old Chinese man who was the companion of the first case. His death on February 1 was the first recorded outside China.[6] He suffered from coinfection with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[21] On March 6, the first case of community transmission is reported by the DOH, a 62-year-old Filipino man from nearby Cainta, Rizal, with no known history of travel abroad and who regularly visited a Muslim prayer hall in Greenhills, San Juan. The next day, on March 7, Taguig records its first COVID-19 case, a lawyer who works at Bonifacio Global City and has a history abroad of travelling to Japan.[22] On March 9, Marikina[23] Pasig,[24] and Quezon City[25] each record its first COVID-19 case. The cities of San Juan, Marikina, and Pasay suspended classes for all levels amid the announcement of the first case of community transmission in the metropolis.[26] The next day, on March 10, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the closure of all schools, colleges, and universities in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14.[27] The Metro Manila Council, consisting of the Metro Manila mayors and headed by chairman Danilo Lim, convene to discuss measures to prevent the spread of the virus as confirmed cases in the region climbed to 33.[28] On March 11, Caloocan records its first COVID-19 case.[29] The same day, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno goes into self-quarantine and isolates himself in the Manila City Hall after arriving from an official trip to London.[30] The following day, on March 12, Las Piñas records its first COVID-19 case.[31] Suspecting that community transmission is underway, President Duterte announces a partial lockdown on Metro Manila, placing the entire Metro Manila under community quarantine for thirty days beginning on March 15. The suspension of classes in all levels in Metro Manila is extended to April 12.[1] Incidents of panic buying are reported across the region, triggered by the president's partial lockdown order.[32] The local chief executives of Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela: Oscar Malapitan, Antolin Oreta, Toby Tiangco, and Rex Gatchalian, respectively, go into self-quarantine after learning they had come into contact with a confirmed coronavirus patient at the inauguration of the North Luzon Expressway\u2013Harbor Link in Caloocan.[33] A total of 56 checkpoints are set up in numerous points of entry to Metro Manila on the first day of the partial lockdown.[34] Following a directive from the Metro Manila Council and the confirmation of COVID-19 cases, the city mayors of Makati, Manila, Pasig, and San Juan declare a state of calamity.[35] On March 14, Mandaluyong records its first three COVID-19 cases.[36] It was followed by Muntinlupa on March 15,[37] Valenzuela on March 19,[38] Malabon on March 23,[39] and Navotas on March 28.[40] On March 16, President Duterte imposes an enhanced community quarantine covering the entire Luzon, including Metro Manila, suspending mass public transportation; restricting land, air, and sea travel; imposing strict home quarantine; and closing most private establishments until April 13.[11] Ninoy Aquino International Airport, except Terminal 1, closes following the suspension of domestic and international flights resulting from travel restriction impositions.[41] The Manila bourse becomes the first major market in the world to shut down over coronavirus fears. It suspends trading for two days following a global stock market crash which saw the main Philippine Stock Exchange index plunge more than 30 percent.[42] Several private hospitals in Metro Manila report operating at full-capacity due to the pandemic and urged patients to look for alternative hospitals.[43] By March 31, the Philippine National Police reports that 10,850 curfew violators have been apprehended across the region since the start of the enhanced community quarantines.[44] On April 1, the City of Manila reports its largest single-day increase in coronavirus infections so far with 41 new cases, bringing the city's total to 116.[45] In the same day, more than 800 Filipino repatriates from four virus-stricken cruise ships in the U.S. arrive at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.[46] The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) announced on April 2 that Metro Manila remains the worst hit by the coronavirus crisis in the country after 1,511 cases were confirmed in the region, or more than 50 percent of the total confirmed cases in the Philippines by that time.[47] COVID-19 inter-agency taskforce spokesman Karlo Nograles announces the mandatory wearing of face masks in public for residents in all regions under enhanced community quarantine in Luzon.[48] The Department of Health launches a 24/7 coronavirus hotline for Metro Manila residents.[49] On April 6, a ten-man medical team from China arrive in Manila to share their experience in prevention and control of the coronavirus disease,[50] while the Metro Manila Development Authority installed decontamination tents in all public hospitals and government offices across the region.[51] On April 3, the National Capital Region Police Office confirm its first COVID-19 casualty among its ranks.[52] On April 7, President Duterte approves an extension of the enhanced community quarantine in the region until April 30.[13] The Rizal Memorial Stadium in Malate was converted by the national government as a 116-bed COVID-19 emergency healthcare facility, with 108 more beds delivered by April 17.[53] The World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office in Manila express its approval of the quarantine measures as it claims it was able to prevent a large-scale community outbreak of the virus in the region.[54] On April 11, the first localized target mass testing began in Valenzuela City.[55] It was followed by City of Manila, Quezon City and Muntinlupa on April 14.[56][57] They were followed elsewhere in Metro Manila, including Parañaque (April 20),[58] Mandaluyong & Taguig (April 22),[59][60] and Makati (April 30).[61] The ECQ in Luzon was extended until May 15 in some areas. This includes Metro Manila, while other places were downgraded to GCQ. On May 16, Metro Manila was placed under a modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) until May 31, after the Philippine government revised its quarantine classifications in correspondence to on earlier announcement that \"Science and Economics will be considered for any changes of the lockdown measures.\" Selected establishments were opened, albeit operating at 50% of its workforce.[62][14][15] All Metro Manila mayors agree to recommend the region to shift to GCQ by June 1, while the local chief executives may still implement localized lockdowns only on places with high COVID-19 cases.[63] With hospitals almost reaching full capacity, the medical frontliners and the healthcare sector called for a two-week lockdown for Metro Manila and 4 neighboring provinces: Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal. This is meant to curb the rising cases and to avoid overwhelming hospitals. For two weeks, from August 3\u201318, Metro Manila and the four provinces were reverted to stricter lockdown. On October 14, seven out of the 127 hospitals in Metro Manila remained at full capacity. The bed occupancy for the region was 52.4 percent, down by 0.2 percent from October 6 which was at 52.6 percent. Cases in Metro Manila continues to decline as the region starts to reopen the economy and transportation.[64] During the holiday season, most laboratories were closed or in a limited testing capacity that caused the cases to drop. On December 22, a woman who arrived in Hong Kong from Manila tested for COVID-19 with her samples showing the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant Lineage B.1.1.7. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine[65] and the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine[66] on January 14 and 28, respectively. On February 19, the IATF-EID recommended the transition of Metro Manila from GCQ to the lowest tier of quarantine measures, the MGCQ, in March to help recover the country's economy. The recommendation was approved by a majority of Metro Manila mayors.[67] However, on February 23, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that there would not be a country-wide MGCQ without the access of the general public to COVID-19 vaccines.[68] As both South African and UK variants have been found in Metro Manila, cities within the region saw a sudden increase on infections. The reimplementation of curfews was put into effect.[69] Special lockdowns have also been set in places that reported a sudden increase of cases. on March 22, A bubble was initiated on the Parts of Metro Manila and Surrounding regions later to be called NCR+ Bubble to further prevent the spread, Checkpoints have been also been reimplemented for those leaving Metro Manila and the bubble itself and all Internet Cafe's, Spa's, Gym's were ordered to once again Close their businesses down to prevent further infections.[70] All cities in Metro manila has reported either one or two variants in their respective Cities.[71] A re-implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine was announced on a press conference on March 27 which was to take effect on March 29 12:01 am but with minor adjustments such as the earlier curfew implementation from 6 pm-5 am the next day and that Public transportation will still be available at a more limited capacity.[72] From August 7 to 20, Metro Manila was again placed on a two-week ECQ amidst the rising cases due to the Delta variant. It was downgraded to MECQ for August 21\u201331. The region was shifted to the new Alert Level system on September 15, 2021, starting with Alert Level 4. Alert Level 1 is currently imposed in the region since March 1, 2022.[73] Under this classification, there are no restrictions in indoor and outdoor capacities of activities and all establishments, persons, or activities are allowed to operate, work, or be undertaken at total on-site or venue seating capacity, given that health standards should be observed. \u201cFace-to-face\u201d classes for basic education are subject to the approval of the Office of the President.[74] The Department of Health earlier stated that Alert Level 1 could be considered as the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Previously, Alert Level 3 was imposed in the region from October 15 to November 4, 2021 and again from January 3 to 31, 2022 (amidst the ,[75][76] and Alert Level 2 from November 5, 2021 to January 2, 2022 and from February 1 to 28, 2022.[77][78] Before the partial lockdown on Metro Manila declared on March 12, President Rodrigo Duterte had initially suspended classes across all levels in Metro Manila from March 10 to 14 upon reaching a consensus with the Metro Manila Council (the mayors of Metro Manila) due to the rapidly increasing number of cases, especially in the area.[79] On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila, that begun on March 15 and will last until April 14. Under the partial lockdown:[80] Following the declaration of the partial lockdown, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) suspended the enforcement of the Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program, more commonly known as the number coding scheme.[81] The Metro Manila Council unanimously approved the imposition of the curfew in a joint resolution. All local governments, except for Marikina and Pateros, had adopted ordinances imposing the curfew in their respective cities, effective by March 20.[82] In that joint resolution, the council also ordered the closure of shopping malls and other establishments during the lockdown.[83] A total of 56 checkpoints were set up to man the borders of Metro Manila on the first day of the partial lockdown.[34] At 12 midnight, a total of 26,000 police and military personnel were deployed to contain the pandemic of COVID-19 in the region. Motorists were stopped randomly and asked for their identification along the borders in North Luzon Expressway, MacArthur Highway, and the National Road (Maharlika Highway). Some checkpoints lacked thermal scanners.[84] Following the moratorium on mass public transportation during the enhanced community quarantine, Vice President Leni Robredo launched free shuttle bus services for those individuals exempted from the quarantine, specifically health professionals, front line government officials, and essential service providers. Robredo's shuttle services travel five routes around Metro Manila, connecting the major hospitals.[85] To address concerns regarding the hoarding and panic buying of essential goods, some city governments issued ordinances to limit the amount of such goods an individual or establishment could purchase.[86][87][88] The Department of Health has on March 20, 2020, has announced that it has designated three health facilities as COVID-19 referral hospitals namely the UP-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) in Manila, the Dr. Jose M. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium in Caloocan and the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City. The UP-PGH has stopped admitting non-emergency cases and the Lung Center has dedicated one of its wings of 40 beds for COVID-19 patients. The Philippine Blood Center likewise will not admit any suspected COVID-19 cases with the health department encouraging the public to continue donating blood for COVID-19 patients with critical and severe conditions.[89] The national government announced on March 25 a cash aid for poor families affected by the pandemic in the region amounting to \u20b18,000 of monthly subsidy over two months as part of the \u20b1200 billion cash assistance program under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act signed by President Duterte.[90] Vice President Robredo converted a dormitory in Cubao, Quezon City, to provide free accommodations for front line health professionals during the enhanced community quarantine.[91] On March 26, the Department of Agriculture launched its first mobile farmers' market in the region, the Kadiwa on Wheels, in Quezon City, to ensure enough food supply amid the closure of most retail establishments due to the region-wide quarantine.[92] Various facilities in the metropolis are being prepared as quarantine sites for less serious COVID-19 cases. Among these are the Philippine International Convention Center, the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex, and the World Trade Center will be fully refurbish by April 12. The three facilities alone can accommodate around 2,000 COVID-19 patients. Other non-hospital facilities being considered as possible quarantine sites include the PhilSports Complex, Duty Free Philippines in Parañaque, Amoranto Stadium, and the Quezon Memorial Circle.[93] On March 12, the Metro Manila Council reached a consensus to implement city-wide curfews from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. the following day to be observed during the enhanced community quarantine, during which only \"essential movements\" for the purchase of essential needs or in cases of emergency are permitted during those hours. Commercial establishments are mandated to suspend operations before the start of the curfew at 8 p.m.[94] All local governments in Metro Manila have signed into effect ordinances to implement the curfew. The governments of Las Piñas,[95] Muntinlupa,[96] Navotas,[97] and Parañaque,[98] however, have since issued ordinances extending the implementation of the curfew to a full 24 hours. On April 2, IATF-EID chairman and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles urged the local governments of Luzon to require residents to wear face masks, face shields, or any improvised alternatives while out in public for the duration of the enhanced community quarantine.[99] In response, the mayors of Malabon, Mandaluyong,[100] Muntinlupa,[101] Parañaque,[102] Pasay, Quezon City,[103] and Valenzuela, each issued ordinances to implement the measure within their respective jurisdictions.[104] Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan announced on March 10 the suspension of several scheduled events in the city: the Miss Caloocan Pageant, Mega Job Fairs, City Development Council General Assembly, Outstanding Citizens Awards Night, and Family Day activities, to prevent the spread of the virus among large crowds.[105] On March 24, the city announced that it would impose window hours on residents for the purchase of essential goods.

Mayor Binay also announced that public school students, persons with disabilities, and senior citizens would also receive financial assistance from the government.[117] On March 18, Malabon Mayor Antolin Oreta ordered the city government to provide \u20b1520,000 ($10,252.26) to each barangay for the provision of food during the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine. Oreta also ordered the provision of \u20b16 million ($118,156.44) to the city's carinderia (food stall) owners for them to provide meals for 300 people every day for 15 days.[118] That same day, he called on Maynilad Water Services to divert the unused water supply of closed malls and other commercial establishments to residential areas.[119] Mayor Oreta endorsed all households in Malabon to the social amelioration program of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) mandated in the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, saying that \"COVID-19 spares no one, rich or poor.\" The DSWD had allotted packages for only 44,032 households in the city, but the Philippine Statistics Authority reported in 2015 that 86,000 households comprise the population of Malabon.[120] The Mandaluyong city council passed an ordinance on March 16 declaring the city under a state of calamity, after reporting three COVID-19 patients, six persons under investigation, and 125 persons under monitoring in the city.[36] On March 17, Mandaluyong Mayor Carmelita Abalos ordered the release of the thirteenth salary pay to all of the city's government employees.[121] Mayor Abalos stated that around 100,000 bags of relief goods would be distributed door-to-door to households in Mandaluyong.[122] Manila Mayor Isko Moreno declared a state of calamity in the city on March 15, following a directive from the Metro Manila Council, after the second and third COVID-19 cases were confirmed.[123] On March 16, the Manila Department of Social Welfare (MDSW) began rescuing street people, pavement dwellers, and other homeless people, as well as people living outside the city who were unable to retreat home following the imposition of the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine. They took refuge at the Delpan Sports Complex in Tondo. The city allocated \u20b1227.5 million ($4.45 million) from the its budget to assist families affected by the quarantine. MDSW Chief Re Fugoso ordered the lockdown of the Manila Boys Town Complex and the Manila Youth Reception Center in Ermita for the protection of the children and teenagers residing there amid the pandemic.[124] On March 18, Mayor Moreno ordered all lodging facilities in Manila to provide free accommodations for front line health workers, such as doctors and nurses, throughout the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine.[125] To financially help the city government employees, Mayor Moreno drafted a resolution ordering the release of their mid-year bonuses. Another resolution appropriating funds and giving cash assistance for the city's job order and contractualized workers was also enacted.[121] On March 19, the city deployed 189 electric tricycles to exclusively transport front line health workers to the city's public hospitals. Non-health workers would not be serviced in observance of the moratorium on mass public transportation. Drivers of electric tricycles would receive salaries from the city government.[126] The city also coordinated with the Department of Social Welfare and Development of the national government in sourcing food supplies for the city's families. Mayor Moreno has stressed that the city could only produce between 8,000 and 11,000 food packs, but would not suffice for the city's 350,000 families. On April 5, Isko Moreno signed an ordinance enacting the City Amelioration Crisis Assistance Fund (CACAF), allocating a total budget of \u20b1591 million ($12 million) for around 568,000 families, and distributing \u20b11,000 ($19.73) to each household.[127] A second tranche was given from May 20 to 21 for more than 680,000 families, some of which do not received from the first CACAF distribution.[128] On March 23, Mayor Isko Moreno launched an online survey via his Facebook page inquiring Manila residents about their health status in relation to COVID-19 and their recent travel history.

PLDT also assisted in augmenting the hotline facility at the Manila City Hall.[129] On April 3, the Manila City Council approved an ordinance penalizing discriminatory acts directed against coronavirus patients and other patients under evaluation, including discrimination of health workers on the basis of their medical condition.[130] The following day on April 4, Mayor Moreno ordered the temporary closure of the Ospital ng Sampaloc after five hospital staff contracted the virus.[131] On April 6, Mayor Moreno announced that he and several other government officials in the city would donate their salaries to the Philippine General Hospital to increase its financial capability amid the pandemic.[132] The Manila government partnered with the Department of Agriculture to launch the Kadiwa Rolling Store project, a mobile farmers' market that sells fresh products to residents amid the closure of retail establishments due to the enhanced community quarantine. The first unit was deployed to Santa Ana on April 6.[133] On April 13, the City of Manila announced that it is now capable of conducting localized mass targeted testing for COVID-19. The six city-owned district hospitals and the Delpan Quarantine Facility each can take up to 232 tests a day, which is capable of producing up to 1,624 swab tests weekly.[134] On the same day, the city placed Barangay 20 in Tondo on total lockdown for 24 hours, because its residents had been conducting leisurely activities such as boxing, gambling and cockfighting despite the Luzon-wide lockdown.[135][136] The city has placed the district of Sampaloc on \"hard lockdown\" from April 23 to 25, followed by the 1st District (western Tondo) on May 3 to 5. Residents are prohibited from leaving their homes. Both of these places have high number of cases and localized targeted testing was conducted during the lockdown.[137][138] The city government also built the Manila COVID-19 Field Hospital in Rizal Park, which began admitting patients on June 25, 2021. On July 6, the city reported that more than 50% of its COVID cases have recovered, but expects a rise in cases after the lifting of a 48-hour lockdown on 31 barangays whose COVID-19 cases are growing, and partly due to the aggressive mass testing being conducted by the City Health Department.[139] On July 15, Mayor Isko Moreno launched the city's drive-thru testing facility, where passengers in vehicles can undergo free COVID-19 testing near the Bonifacio Shrine in Ermita. The drive-thru facility is open to both residents and non-residents of the city, making it the first testing facility of its kind in the country.[140] Three days later, the city government opened a second drive-thru testing facility at the Quirino Grandstand.[141] Manila is also the first local government unit in the country to purchase and procure anti-COVID-19 medicines such as Molnupiravir, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Baricitinib, and Bexovid for aged 12 and above, all of which prevents mild to moderate cases from progressing into severe diseases. The medicines are given for free to both residents and non-residents as long as they coordinate with the Manila Health Department and provide prescription.[142][143][144] Manila was the only city in the National Capital Region that is not under COVID-19 Alert Level 4.[145] Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro on March 16 announced that his government would install misting and decontamination tents across numerous public spaces in the city.[146] The Marikina government pledged to provide households with free disinfectant solutions.[147] Following the moratorium on mass public transportation during the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine, the Marikina government launched on March 18 free shuttle bus services to ferry front line health professionals from across the city to its hospitals.[148] The Marikina government announced plans to set up a COVID-19 testing center. On March 16, Mayor Teodoro announced that around 3,000 testing kits would be procured and the government would partner with Manila Health Tek and the Philippine National Institutes of Health, to test \"patients under investigation\" (PUIs) and \"patients under monitoring\" (PUMs) for COVID-19.[146] Field testing was scheduled to begin on March 24. The procurement of a \u20b12.7 million ($53,222.42) polymerase chain reaction machine specifically for testing, along with 3,000 test kits worth \u20b14 million ($78,824.72) was also announced by the city government.[149] On March 26, Mayor Teodoro reported that the DOH rejected the usage of the city government's COVID-19 testing center because of its location, which had to be in a \"separate free-standing building\", but was located inside the Marikina City Health Office.
