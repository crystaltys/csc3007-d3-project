Nominees would be solely decided based on votes from the Recording Academy.[11] For the 2022 ceremony and during both voting rounds, the number of categories members of the Recording Academy were allowed to vote in was reduced to ten, on top of the four major categories. The ten categories could belong to up to three different fields, including the genre fields. The changes were made to \"help ensure the quality of voting\".[3] Drake was initially announced as a nominee for Best Rap Performance (for \"Way 2 Sexy\") and Best Rap Album (for Certified Lover Boy), but withdrew from contention for both awards on December 6, 2021.[12] The Recording Academy subsequently honored Drake's request and officially removed his nominations for both awards.[12] The ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on January 31, 2022, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

Prior to the performance, a short video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy concerning the circumstances of warfare and military activity in Ukraine was played.[23] Zelenskyy's appearance was seen by some as a way to make up for the rejection of the similar idea during the 94th Academy Awards the week before.[24] The In Memoriam segment was introduced by host Trevor Noah, with Cynthia Erivo, Ben Platt, Leslie Odom Jr., and Rachel Zegler performing multiple songs by American composer Stephen Sondheim during the segment, including \"Somewhere\" (from West Side Story), \"Send in the Clowns\" (from A Little Night Music), and \"Not a Day Goes By\" (from Merrily We Roll Along).[25]","Title":"64th Annual Grammy Awards - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2815","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64th_Annual_Grammy_Awards"}
