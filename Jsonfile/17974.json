{"Content: ":"Death Steps in the Dark (Italian: Passi di morte perduti nel buio, which translates as Death Steps Lost in the Dark) is a 1977 Italian-Greek giallo film directed by Maurizio Pradeaux.[1][2] Pradeaux directed only one other giallo, the 1973 Death Carries a Cane. An Italian reporter named Luciano (Leonard Mann) is on an express train in Greece when a murder occurs. As the train goes into a darkened tunnel, the murderer takes the opportunity to kill a woman on the train with a letter opener. Since the letter opener belonged to Luciano, the people on the train blame him for the girl's murder. With the aid of his Swedish girlfriend (Vera Kruska) and a criminal he meets along the way, Luciano tries to prove his innocence by solving the mystery and producing the real culprit.
