By Octumber 2021, Honduras reports 5.76 M doses administered it represents 24.5% of its total population. While other countries in the region already vaccinated up to a quarter of their populations.[63] Honduras is one of the recipients of vaccines distributed by the COVAX mechanism, which is a worldwide initiative that seeks equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. By end of May 2021, Honduras has received 238,000 doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford Vaccine and 253,832 doses have been administered nationwide.[64] The total supply of vaccines covers 7.5% of the Honduran population.[65] In contrast to other Latin American countries, Honduras, along with Guatemala, Nicaragua and Paraguay, has not received vaccine donations from China as a result of vaccine diplomacy. The reason for that is that these countries have diplomatic ties with Taiwan instead of China and recognize Taipei over Beijing.[66] Indeed, the Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández has expressed interest in opening a trade office for China in order to access more vaccines.[66] While neighbouring country El Salvador has received thousands of doses of Chinese vaccines, the number of contracted doses in Honduras remains very low and most of them come through the COVAX mechanism. The need for vaccine supply remains urgent, which has led the Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele to donate 34,000 doses to seven towns in Honduras where the mayors have posted pleas for vaccines on social media.[67]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Honduras - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10724","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Honduras"}
