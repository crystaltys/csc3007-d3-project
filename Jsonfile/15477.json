The global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, which began in 2020, has continued, and the year saw the lifting of COVID restrictions, and reopening of international borders. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II, has caused the displacement of 16.8 million Ukrainians (8 million internally displaced persons and 8.8 million refugees) and lead to international condemnations and sanctions, the withdrawal of hundreds of companies from Russia, and the exclusion of Russia from major sporting events.","Title":"2022 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15477","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022"}
