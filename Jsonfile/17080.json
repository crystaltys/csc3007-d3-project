{"Content: ":"The men's water polo tournament at the 1992 Summer Olympics was held from 1 to 10 August 1992, in Barcelona, Spain. Reigning world champion Yugoslavia had qualified for the tournament, but as it had formally dissolved in the interim, it did not participate. The successor countries did not participate for several reasons. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) could not participate due to the UN sanctions due to their aggression on Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia, which was the strongest among them at the time (the Croatian club was champion of Yugoslavia and European Champions' Cup winner), also did not participate in the water polo tournament. The position of Yugoslavia was replaced by Czechoslovakia.[1][2] Australia Greece France Netherlands  Head Coach: Ratko Rudić Head Coach: Dragan Matutinović Head Coach: Boris Popov","Title":"Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17080","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics"}
