Ariana Television Network gained international attention when Mohammad Nasir Fayyaz, a journalist and presenter of Ariana's hard-talk political debate show Haqiqat (The Truth in English), was detained by Afghan authorities on July 29, 2008. Fayyaz was critical of members of the country's cabinet at the time.[1] He was detained by the intelligence agency National Directorate of Security (NDS) whilst he was presenting the show, and was released after one day but again returned to detention. Amnesty International warned the Afghan government to protect press and media freedom from the NDS.[2] He was eventually released without charge and continued to present Haqiqat.","Title":"Ariana Television Network - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9928","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_News"}
