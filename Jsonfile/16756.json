The Brazilian militias emerged in the late 2000s, being made up of off-duty police officers with assistance from local businessmen who need protection from armed gangs.[6] The Comando Vermelho as a response began carrying out terrorist attacks against civilian targets between 27 and 31 December 2006, in these attacks 19 people died, 10 civilians, two policemen and 7 drug traffickers. As a response, the police do a loto of ride against the gang, killing more than 100 drug traffickers.[7][8] The militias began attacks between January 2007 and March 2008 against the Comando Vermelho, killing 20 drug traffickers.[9] The militias obtained a Caveirão from the police to use against drug traffickers in January of the same year.[10] According to some investigations, the militias finance their armed struggle with illegal activities, such as extortion, kidnapping, usury and racketeering, but also robbery, human trafficking, pimping, arms trafficking and doing terrorist attempts.[11][12][13] In May 2008, the militiamen, commanded by Coronel Jairo, kidnapped and tortured a troup of journalists from the Brazilian newspaper O Dia who were reporting the criminal activities perpetrated by the militiamen. After 7 hours of torture they were released.[14] In that same month, in the clashes between the Comando Vermelho and the militias there were 10 dead. Residents were threatened by the fighting groups and the president of an association for local residents was kidnapped and never found.[15] On 5 August, Carlos Alexandre Silva Cavalcante, the \"Gaguinho\", leader of a faction of the militias, was killed.[16] On August 20, 2008, militias killed 7 people in the Carobinha favela to try to blame Comando Vermelho for the massacre and get the support of civilians.[17] The Morro dos Macacos is one of the most violent favelas in Rio de Janeiro, the hill was invaded by CV on October 17, 2009, but it was also controlled by the ADA, who began to fight the CV to contend for territory, 5 gang members were killed in the clashes from 11 to 17 october. In order to stop the clashes between the two groups, about 150 men of the assault troops of the special department of the Polícia Militar were sent for patrol and containment activities. Precisely to prevent the intervention of the police in the feud, the criminals built makeshift barricades in the area with the means available (tires, various irons) and subsequently set them on fire.[18] On 17 october, in the morning, the rear propeller of a Fenix helicopter patrolling above the hill is hit by some shots fired by drug traffickers: according to some the weapon was a bazooka or a machine gun. The helicopter crashes, 2 soldiers die in the impact, another soldier die later.[19] The attack will start a very violent civil war between police, militias and gangs. From 17 to 25 October 2009, there were 45 war-related deaths.[20] After the battle, there were other clashes between militiamen and drug traffickers. Throughout the 2010 decade there were arrests and convictions against militiamen and drug traffickers involved in the conflict. The militias managed to conquer several territories in the hands of the Comando Vermelho, but some of them later returned to the gang after having reconquered it with violent shootings. In November 2010, another conflict occurred between the police and the CV, in this operation there were 41 deaths.[21] After his election for president of Bazil, Jair Bolsonaro supported the violent militias to kill drug dealers.[22] For the conflict, the CV recruits child soldiers, even the militias have begun to recruit child soldiers.[23][24] On February 9, 2020, a prominent militia faction leader, Adriano Magalhães da Nóbrega, also known as Capitan Adriano or Gordinho, was seriously injured in a police operation and later died in hospital.[25] On May 17, 2022, militias attacked a civilian helicopter with rifles while flying over the Rio area, no injuries were recorded but the helicopter was slightly damaged.[26]","Title":"Militias-Comando Vermelho conflict - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16756","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militias-Comando_Vermelho_conflict"}
