{"Content: ":"The 2022 monkeypox outbreak in Japan is a part of the larger outbreak of human monkeypox caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. According to the Minister of Health, Japan's first monkeypox case was reported in Tokyo on 25 July 2022. Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and some other animals.[2] Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over.[2] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from five to twenty-one days.[3][4] The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks.[4] There may be mild symptoms, and it may occur without any symptoms being known.[3][5] The classic presentation of fever and muscle pains, followed by swollen glands, with lesions all at the same stage, has not been found to be common to all outbreaks.[2][6] Cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems.[7] The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus. The variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is also in this genus.[8] Of the two types in humans, the West African type causes a less severe disease than the Central African (Congo basin) type.[9] It may spread from infected animals by handling infected meat or via bites or scratches.[10] Human-to-human transmission can occur through exposure to infected body fluids or contaminated objects, by small droplets, and possibly through the airborne route.[2][10] People can spread the virus from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and fallen off; with some evidence of spread for more than a week after lesions have crusted.[9] Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing a lesion for the virus's DNA.[11] An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox was confirmed on 6 May 2022, beginning with a British resident who, after travelling to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic), presented symptoms consistent with monkeypox on 29 April 2022. The resident returned to the United Kingdom on 4 May, creating the country's index case of the outbreak.[18] The origin of several of the cases of monkeypox in the United Kingdom is unknown. Some monitors saw community transmission taking place in the London area as of mid-May,[19] but it has been suggested that cases were already spreading in Europe in the previous months.[20] The first known case of the monkeypox outbreak in Japan was detected on 25 July 2022. According to the Ministry of Health, the index case was a man in his 30s who had recently traveled to Europe, and he had contact with someone who was later diagnosed with monkeypox.[21]","Title":"2022 monkeypox outbreak in Japan - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9894","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_monkeypox_outbreak_in_Japan"}
