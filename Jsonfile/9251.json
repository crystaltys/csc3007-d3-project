{"Content: ":"Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) is an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists.[1][2] It manifests as an allergic response to animal urine, specifically the major urinary proteins (Mups) of rodents, and can lead to the development of asthma.[3] A study of 5641 workers in Japan who were exposed to laboratory animals found 23.1% had one or more allergic symptoms; globally the prevalence among at risk workers is estimated between 11 and 30% [4] According to the National Institutes of Health, prevention of animal allergy depends on the control of allergens in the work environment. This involves a combination of measures to eliminate or control allergen exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment.[5] The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene,[6] known as Mus m 1, Ag1 or MA1,[7] accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. Similarly, the product of the rat Mup13 gene, Rat n 1, is also a potent human allergen.[3] One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Rat n 1.[8]","Title":"Laboratory animal allergy - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9251","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_animal_allergy"}
