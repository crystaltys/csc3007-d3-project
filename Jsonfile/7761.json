{"Content: ":"The Avarpi or Auarpoi or Avarni were Germanic tribe attested in Ptolemy's Geography. The attested Greek is Auarpoi. Avarpi is a scholarly transliteration into Latin, with some using Avarni on the assumption that the name refers to the Varni of Mecklenburg. However, Ptolemy uses Farodeinoi for Varini[citation needed] and clearly says that the Auarpoi are next to the Teutonikai and between the Sueboi and the Farodeinoi. This location is not precise, but is somewhere in the Pommern/Propommern region.  This article about an ethnic group in Europe is a stub.
