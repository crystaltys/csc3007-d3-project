{"Content: ":"The United Nations Office for Partnerships (UNOP) is a UN body that serves as the gateway for pursuing and building partnerships with the private sector, civil society organizations, academia, and other non-State actors in furtherance of the Sustainable Development Goals.[1] It was established in 2006 by Secretary General Kofi Annan.[2] Previous attempts to create the body had failed, as there were concerns that public-private partnerships were inconsistent with the intergovernmental nature of the UN.[2] The Office oversees the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships (UNFIP) and the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF). The United Nations Fund for International Partnerships (UNFIP) was established by then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan in March 1998 to serve as the interface between the United Nations system and the United Nations Foundation\u2014the public charity responsible for administering Ted Turner's $1 billion contribution in support of UN causes. The work of UNFIP is overseen by the UNFIP Advisory Board, which is chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General. The United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF) was established by the Secretary-General in July 2005 to support democratization around the world. It focuses on strengthening the voice of civil society, promoting human rights and ensuring the participation of all groups in democratic processes. Through the Fund, the Office supported almost 600 projects in more than 130 countries around the world, ranging from strengthening civil society leadership skills and promoting the participation of women and youth to media programmes that allow civil society to project its voice.[citation needed] The United Nations Democracy Fund was established during the 2005 World Summit as a United Nations General Trust Fund and launched in April 2006, with the United Nations Office for Partnerships/UNFIP providing administrative support and resource-sharing. Since then, the grant-making body has become clearly defined as a fund for civil society organizations. It is the only United Nations entity that has the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d in its name, the only United Nations body with the primary purpose of supporting democracy through empowering civil society and one of the youngest entities in the United Nations system. The large majority of project funds go to local civil society organizations in countries in both the transition and consolidation phases of democratization. By supporting the \u201cdemand\u201d rather than the \u201csupply\u201d side of democratization, the Fund plays a new, distinct and unique role in complementing and enhancing the more traditional work of the United Nations \u2014 the work with governments \u2014 to strengthen democratic governance around the world.[citation needed] A key part of the Fund\u2019s mission is to ensure that all levels of government are accountable to those they serve by increasing the knowledge, capacity, voice and reach of citizens\u2019 organizations. With the adoption in September 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Fund undertook to prioritize projects that, inter alia, hold governments accountable with regard to working to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.[citation needed]","Title":"United Nations Office for Partnerships - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9382","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_Partnerships"}
