{"Content: ":"Thamotharampillai Sivasithamparam (Tamil: தாமோதரம்பிள்ளை சிவசிதம்பரம்; 26 March 1926 \u2013 9 November 1992) was a Sri Lankan Tamil politician and Member of Parliament. Sivasithamparam was born on 26 March 1926.[1][2] He was the son of Thamotharampillai, a village headman from Mullaitivu in northern Ceylon.[1] He was educated at Trincomalee Hindu College.[1] Sivasithamparam married Nagambi.[1] They had three sons (Sugumaran, Srikanthan and Sivakumar) and two daughters (Vanetha and Kanchana).[1] Sivasithamparam was a Village Cultivation Officer (VCO).[1] Sivasithamparam stood as an independent candidate in Vavuniya at the March 1960 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament.[3] He was re-elected at the July 1960 parliamentary election.[4] He later joined the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC), serving as its youth leader.[5] He contested the 1965 parliamentary election as the ACTC candidate and was re-elected.[6] He was however defeated by the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) candidate X. M. Sellathambu at the 1970 parliamentary election.[7] On 14 May 1972 the ACTC, ITAK, Ceylon Workers' Congress, Eelath Thamilar Otrumai Munnani and All Ceylon Tamil Conference formed the Tamil United Front, later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).[8][9][10][11] Sivasithamparam was the TULF's candidate in Vavuniya at the 1977 parliamentary election and was re-elected.[12] Sivasithamparam and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Sivasithamparam forfeited his seat in Parliament on 5 October 1983.[13] On 30 September 1983 the Sri Lankan Army attacked Sivasithamparam's Madukulam farm, beating to death the farm manager Nadarajah and burning his body.[14] Fearing for his life, Sivasithamparam fled to India.[14] He later migrated to Canada where he died on 9 November 1992.[1]","Title":"T.
