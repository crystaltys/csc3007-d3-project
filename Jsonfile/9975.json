{"Content: ":"An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox, a viral disease, was confirmed in May 2022.[5] The initial cluster of cases was found in the United Kingdom,[6] where the first case was detected on 6 May 2022 in an individual with travel links to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic).[7] The outbreak marked the first time monkeypox has spread widely outside Central and West Africa. From 18 May onwards, cases were reported from an increasing number of countries and regions, predominantly in Europe but also in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.[14] On 23 July, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), raising the status of the outbreak to a global health emergency.[15][16] As of 28 July, there were a total of 20,846 confirmed cases.[17] Monkeypox is a viral infection that manifests a week or two after exposure with fever and other non-specific symptoms, and then produces a rash with lesions that usually last for 2-4 weeks before drying up, crusting and falling off.[7] While monkeypox can cause large numbers of lesions, in the current outbreak, some patients experience only a single lesion in the mouth or on the genitals, making it more difficult to differentiate from other infections.[18] In infections before the current outbreak, 1\u20133 percent of people with known infections have died (without treatment). Cases in children and immunocompromised people are more likely to be severe.[19] Monkeypox is most likely primarily spread through close contact, including close contact during sexual activity,[20] but it is not classified as a sexually transmitted disease as it does not require contact with genital fluids to spread.[21][22] As of 21 July, 98% of reported cases outside endemic regions in Africa occurred in the community of men who have sex with men, particularly those with multiple sexual partners, 75% occured in ethnically white people, and 41% in people with HIV/AIDS.[23][24] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized the importance of reducing stigma in communicating about the demographic aspects of monkeypox, specifically with regards to gay and bisexual men.[25] Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and some other animals.[26] Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over.[26] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from five to twenty-one days.[27][28] The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks.[28] There may be mild symptoms, and it may occur without any symptoms being known.[27][29] The classic presentation of fever and muscle pains, followed by swollen glands, with lesions all at the same stage, has not been found to be common to all outbreaks.[26][30] Cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems.[31] The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus. The variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is also in this genus.[32] Of the two types in humans, the West African type causes a less severe disease than the Central African (Congo basin) type.[33] It may spread from infected animals by handling infected meat or via bites or scratches.[34] Human-to-human transmission can occur through exposure to infected body fluids or contaminated objects, by small droplets, and possibly through the airborne route.[26][34] People can spread the virus from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and fallen off; with some evidence of spread for more than a week after lesions have crusted.[33] Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing a lesion for the virus's DNA.[35] In March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative led a tabletop exercise at the Munich Security Conference simulating hypothetical public health responses to the release of genetically manipulated strains of viruses, including monkeypox.[42] On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the monkeypox outbreak as a global health emergency as the number of infected cases rose above 17,000 people.[43][44] The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has alerted several members of the African Union in May 2022 about cases of monkeypox. The director of the Africa CDC, Ahmed Ogwell, said that Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria have reported 1405 endemic cases with 62 deaths during early 2022 to May 2022. The case fatality rate in these four African countries combined is 4.4%.[45] In an article in The Conversation, Oyewale Tomori pointed out that the number of monkeypox infections in Nigeria through 2021 is likely to be under-reported because much of the Nigerian population has been avoiding healthcare facilities due to fear of contracting COVID-19.[46] Nigeria's surveillance of various diseases, including monkeypox, had to focus on the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, missing many cases and resulting in a drop in official statistics.[47] As British health authorities reported the first case of monkeypox in the UK in May 2022, the Nigerian government has released to the public information and statistics on reported cases and deaths in the country. In the report of 9 May 2022, the NCDC stated that 230 cases were confirmed across 20 states and the Federal Capital Territory between 2017 and 2022. Rivers State was the most affected, followed by Bayelsa and Lagos. In the span from 2017 to 2022, the NCDC reported six deaths in six different states, making for a 3.3% case fatality ratio.[48] On 30 May, the first death from monkeypox was reported in Nigeria during 2022, the last time a death was reported in the country from this disease was in 2019.[49] The following table shows 2022 cases in countries which experienced endemic monkeypox before the current outbreak, as of 17 June according to the WHO:[50][51] Monkeypox is endemic to West and Central Africa.[56][57] Prior to the 2022 outbreak, the United Kingdom had recorded only seven previous cases of monkeypox,[58] all of which were imported cases from Africa or healthcare workers involved in their treatment. The first three such cases were in 2018,[58] followed by a further case in 2019[59] and three more in 2021.[60] The only major monkeypox outbreak to be recorded in a Western country prior to 2022 was the 2003 Midwest monkeypox outbreak in the United States, which did not feature community transmission.[61][62] This outbreak is of the West African clade, which has a reported case fatality rate of 1% according to the World Health Organization.[63] The genomic sequence of the virus associated with this outbreak was first published on 19 May by Portuguese researchers.[64] They confirmed that the monkeypox virus was of the West African clade, related to other previous international outbreaks in 2018\u201319.[65] The 2022 outbreak has a different pattern of spread compared to prior monkeypox outbreaks outside Africa.[66] Genetic evidence suggest the outbreak likely started in Nigeria.[67][68] Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, spread of the virus through close contact is more likely, with transmission during sexual activities being the most common route.[20] Most cases have been in men.[21] A significant proportion of cases, although not all, are in men who have sex with men (MSM), notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK,[21] with many cases diagnosed in sexual health clinics.[66] Cases are mostly in young and middle-aged men.[69] This points to transmission due to close contact during sex as being one route of transmission.[21] In May 2022, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) considered the monkeypox virus to be moderately transmissible among humans. According to the centre, among MSM who contracted the virus, the most common means of transmission is likely through sexual activity due to intimate contact with infectious skin lesions. The ECDC rated likelihood of transmission due to close contact, including sexual contact, as \"high\", but, without close contact, as low.[20] In Nature, Anne Rimoin and Raina MacIntyre speculate that the higher percentage of MSM affected is a result of coincidental introduction to the community and then sexual activity constituting \"close contact\" rather than the virus itself becoming sexually transmitted.[70] Monkeypox is not primarily a sexually transmitted disease.[21] As of 23 July, 99% cases outside endemic regions in Africa were in men. In this group, 98% of cases occurred in the community of men who have sex with men,[24] mainly those who have multiple sex partners (median of 5 partners in the previous 3 months). 75% were white, 57% were on pre-exposure prophylaxis, and 41% had HIV/AIDS, of which 96% were on antiretroviral therapy. 29% had another concomitant sexually transmitted infection, and in the previous month, 32% attended a sex on premises venue and 20% engaged in chemsex.[23] On 23 May, David Heymann, an advisor for the World Health Organization, said that the likely theory of how the outbreak started is transmission during sexual intercourse of gay and bisexual men at two raves in Belgium and Spain.[71] On 25 May, The Guardian stated that many scientists suspect the disease was circulating across Europe before reaching the MSM community, possibly misdiagnosed or detected only in isolated cases; four cases were diagnosed in 2018 and 2019, all in individuals recently arrived from Nigeria.[72] The UK Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group[73] warned that the virus could reach wildlife and become endemic as a result.[74][75] In the beginning of May 2022, a case of monkeypox in a British resident who had travelled to Lagos and Delta State in Nigeria,[76] in areas where monkeypox is considered to be an endemic disease, was reported. The person developed a rash on 29 April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4 May,[58] and presented to hospital later the same day. Monkeypox infection was immediately suspected, and the patient was hospitalised at a specialist clinical unit of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust[58] and isolated, then tested positive for the virus on 6 May.[76] Testing of patient swab samples by polymerase chain reaction revealed the outbreak to be of the West African clade of monkeypox, which is the less deadly of the two known monkeypox variants with a case fatality rate of around 1%.[76] Extensive contact tracing of people who had been in contact with the index case both on the international flight from Nigeria to the United Kingdom and within the country following their arrival was carried out, with potential contacts advised to remain aware of the symptoms of monkeypox and immediately isolate if any were to develop within 21 days of the contact event.[76] Following this contact tracing effort, the World Health Organization (WHO) considered further transmission of the virus within the United Kingdom to be of \"minimal\" risk.[76] Contact tracing was extended to Scotland on 14 May according to Public Health Scotland. A \"small number\" of people in Scotland were ordered to self-isolate following close contact with the person initially reported to have been infected, although overall risk to the general public remained \"very low\".[58] On 12 May two new cases of monkeypox were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), both in London,[77] living together in the same household, with no known link between either of them and either the index case or travel to endemic regions. One of the new cases was hospitalised at St Mary's Hospital, while the other case with milder symptoms was said to be self-isolating at home.[77] On 17 May, another four cases of monkeypox were confirmed by the UKHSA in three Londoners and a person in North East England who had previously travelled to London.[78] Unusually, none of these new cases had any known contact history with the previous three confirmed cases, which suggested a kind of transmission that had not been seen before,[79] a wider community transmission of the virus in the London area. The UKHSA stated that the risk to the general public remained \"very low\".[78][80] Patients with active monkeypox infection were confirmed to be hospitalised at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne and at the Royal Free Hospital and Guy's Hospital in London.[78] Also on 20 May, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid reported that another eleven cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the country to twenty. UKHSA reported on 10 June that 311 of the 314 cases where sex was known were men, and that all of the 151 infected persons who filled out an additional questionnaire and answered questions about sexual practices were men who have sex with men, abbreviated MSM.[81] Dr. Susan Hopkins from the UKHSA urged watchfulness among men who have sex with men.[82] The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advised people who have had close contact with a person infected with monkeypox to self-isolate for 21 days.[83] Further cases in multiple countries outside the endemic area were reported through the second half of May 2022. On 18 May, Portugal reported 14 cases of monkeypox.[84] In Spain, there were seven confirmed cases as of 18 May.[85] On the same day, the United States confirmed its first 2022 case of monkeypox and Canada reported 13 suspected cases.[86][87] On 19 May, Sweden, Belgium[88][89] and Italy confirmed their first cases.[90] On 20 May, Australia,[91][92] Germany, France and the Netherlands confirmed their first cases.[93][94][95] In the remainder of May, multiple European countries[96][97][98][99] and Israel confirmed their first cases.[100][10] The United Arab Emirates[101] and Mexico also confirmed their first cases.[102] On 23 May, Dr. Sue Hopkins, the chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency, announced that 37 new monkeypox cases had been confirmed, more than doubling the total confirmed in the UK to 57 cases.[103] On 25 July, Japan reported its first case of Monkeypox. Smallpox vaccines containing vaccinia such as Imvanex (Jynneos) and ACAM2000 can provide around 85% effectiveness against monkeypox.[104] This protection level is calculated from studies using smallpox vaccines tested in late 1980 in Africa.[105][106][107] The UKHSA has begun using Imvanex as post-exposure prophylaxis for close contacts of known cases.[108] According to the CDC the vaccination with Jynneos/Imvanex is \"[a]dministered as two subcutaneous injections four weeks apart.\" while the vaccination with ACAM2000 is \"administered as one percutaneous dose via multiple puncture technique with a bifurcated needle.\"[104] However, ACAM2000 is not recommended for potentially immunocompromised persons due to high replication competency of vaccinia while JYNNEOS is recommended for potentially immunocompromised persons due it containing an attenuated, non-replicating orthopoxvirus, Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN).[109][104] On 25 May, disease experts from the NICD in South Africa said they saw no need for mass vaccination, because they believe cases will not explode as they did in the COVID-19 pandemic.[110] In reaction to the current outbreak of monkeypox, a number of countries have stated they are buying vaccines and/or releasing vaccines from national stockpiles for use in the outbreak. In May 2022, the US,[111][112] Spain,[113] Germany[114] and the UK[115] all announced purchases of smallpox vaccine. On 24 May, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director Jennifer McQuiston confirmed the United States is releasing some of their Jynneos vaccine supply from their Strategic National Stockpile for people who are \"high-risk\".[116][117] On 23 June, the New York City Department of Health announced a clinic at the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic to offer the two dose JYNNEOS vaccine to \"...all gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (cisgender or transgender) ages 18 and older who have had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the last 14 days.\"[118] As of May 2022, public health authorities have aimed to target resources and education to affected groups, but avoid stigma which could discourage people with symptoms or who have been exposed from seeking help.[69] LGBTQ+ rights groups have issued statements advising media to avoid stigmatising marginalised groups such as men who have sex with men.[119][120] On 22 May, UNAIDS urged communicators to avoid stigma by taking an evidence-based approach, reiterated that the disease can affect anyone and that risk is by no means limited to men who have sex with men.[121] On 24 May, The Washington Post published an article that pointed out the lack of global attention to the disease when it only affected Africans, compared to the attention directed at it when a small number of cases started affecting Western countries.[122] Some also objected to pictures used in media coverage of mild illnesses in Europe that featured severe cases in sub-Saharan Africans.[122] Misinformation and conspiracy theories spread online in various social media networks.[123][124] In an article published by the BBC in May 2022 countering misinformation about the monkeypox outbreak, journalist Rachel Schraer noted that social media accounts and news outlets from different countries including China, Russia, Ukraine and the United States have been promoting the idea that the outbreak was caused by a lab leak or that monkeypox is being used as a bioweapon.[125] The Institute for Strategic Dialogue stated about this as \"Reviving the spread of a set of cut-and-paste... conspiracies\", referring to conspiracy theories used during the COVID-19 pandemic.[67][126] The BBC also made it clear that the genetic sequences of the virus, as far as is known, date back to a West African strain.[67] On 20 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened an emergency meeting of independent advisers to discuss the outbreak and assess the threat level.[127] Initial assessments expressed the expectation of the outbreak to be contained, and of low impact to the general population in affected countries.[5][128] Its European chief, Hans Kluge, expressed concern that infections could accelerate in Europe as people gather for parties and festivals over the summer.[129] On 1 June, a WHO statement acknowledged that undetected transmission had occurred for some time,[130] and called for urgent action to reduce transmission.[131][132] On 14 June, the WHO announced plans to rename the monkeypox virus in order to combat stigma and racism surrounding the disease.[133] A meeting convened on 23 June determined that the outbreak did not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern for the time being,[134] but that decision was overturned by a later meeting on 23 July.[135] This is a table of confirmed and suspected monkeypox cases outside of African countries where the virus is endemic. It does not include countries where suspected cases were reported but later discarded such as Afghanistan,[201][202] Costa Rica,[203] and Fiji.[204] Countries listed below had only suspected cases at the time of reporting. Some countries reported confirmed cases after reporting suspected cases (i.e. Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Ecuador, Peru). Countries listed several times reported suspected cases again after they discarded suspected cases before.","Title":"2022 monkeypox outbreak - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9975","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_monkeypox_outbreak_in_North_America"}
