{"Content: ":"Boyhood a.k.a. A Record of Youth (少年期, Shōnenki) is a 1951 Japanese drama film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita. It is based on a collection of letters by writer Isoko Hatano.[2][4] When a family of Tokyo war evacuees arrives at the outskirts of Suwa, they are met with hostility by most villagers. The father, an English professor who had to quit lecturing due to his liberal views, opposes his son Ichirō's wish to enlist at a military school. Ichirō, who previously had to suffer mockery at school for alleged cowardness, is now confronted with his new schoolmates' reluctance and bullied by the son of the local military commander. He is also at odds with his father because of his father's staying at home and reading, while the mother works for the family's income. After Japan's defeat, the commander's son tries to kill Ichirō before committing suicide himself for the inflicted \"shame\", but Ichirō can fend him off. The ending hints at more peaceful times lying ahead for the family. The screenplay for Boyhood is based on a compilation of letters exchanged between child psychologist and writer Isoko Hatano and her son in 1944\u20131946. The book was published in 1950 and became a nationwide bestseller. An English translation was published in 1962.[5][6]","Title":"Boyhood (1951 film) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16884","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyhood_(1951_film)"}
