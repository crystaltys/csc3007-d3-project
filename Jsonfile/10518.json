{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the kingdom was confirmed by the Ministry of Health on 2 March 2020[2][3] and in the following months, the kingdom held the highest number of confirmed cases in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[4] The kingdom announced the suspension of all domestic and international travel on March 21; domestic travel being reinitiated on May 21. After curfews and lockdowns were placed on several administrative levels, the number of daily confirmed cases shrunk dramatically and by June 21, all curfews were lifted through a three-phase program enacted throughout the country, except the city of Mecca.[5] By mid-July, the kingdom was seeing more daily recoveries than cases. The Hajj took place with only 10,000 socially-distanced pilgrims allowed to take part in the annual pilgrimage, which fell during the last week of July and the first week of August.[6] The economy of Saudi Arabia also suffered a heavy impact; a budget deficit of 9 billion US dollars was reported in the first quarter of 2020 caused by the decline in oil prices and the economic effects of the pandemic.[7][8] Several measures were taken to help stimulate the economy, including increasing the value-added tax from 5% to 15%, effective 1 July,[7][8] and cutting spending by 100 billion riyals (US$26,600,000,000).[9] As of September 7, the kingdom has seen a little over 320,000 confirmed cases with more than 4,000 deaths attributed to the virus, and international air travel is still suspended. A budget deficit of 40.768 billion riyals was posted by the government in its third quarter of 2020, which was reportedly more than half of the deficit calculated in the previous quarter. The change in figures resulted following the spike in non-oil revenue, which kicked off a continued fall in oil income. The economy is said to further shrink by 3.8% in the remaining months of 2020, as per government estimates due to the impact of coronavirus crisis on the global demand for crude. Riyadh plans to cut down on its spending in 2021 to 990 billion riyals.[10] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a group of people in the city of Wuhan, Hubei in China which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[11][12] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[13][14] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[13][15] From 3 January 2020 to 14 April 2022, there have been 752,188 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia with 9,062 deaths, reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO).[16]  In March 2021, the Saudi Ministry of Health reported that Saudi Arabia is witnessing a huge rise in the number of active and critical cases of COVID-19.

The kingdom stated that those involved will be subject to legal accountability and heavy penalties will be imposed on them.[63] On 10 May 2020, Saudi Arabia announced suspension of the 1000 riyals/month cost-of-living allowance from 1 June, and an increase in the value-added tax from 5% to 15% from 1 July.[7][8] The Kingdom will also cut spending by 100 billion riyals (US$26,600,000,000).[9] The measures are due to a budget deficit of US$9,000,000,000 in the first quarter of 2020, decline in oil prices, and the economic effects of the pandemic.[7][8] Official data reported on 30 September 2020 by Reuters showed that Saudi Arabia's economy declined by 7% in both Oil and non-oil sector in the second quarter following coronavirus pandemic. General Authority for Statistics said \u201cThe private sector and the government sector recorded a negative growth rate of 10.1% and 3.5%, respectively.\u201d Unemployment in the Kingdom also reportedly hit a record high, i.e. 15.4%.[64] According to analysts, recovering from such a hit might be more difficult due to budget constraints as a result of declining oil prices.[65] At the start of the pandemic, oil prices decreased to below $20 a barrel in April after Saudi Arabia entered an oil price war. While a truce among the world's top oil producers has pushed the price of oil up to $40 a barrel, this figure is still almost half the price of oil per barrel at the start of 2020. Furthermore, oil prices are significantly lower than the $76 a barrel the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Saudi Arabia requires in order to balance its budget this year. The kingdom obtains more than three-quarters of its earnings from oil. The IMF expects the Saudi economy to contract by about 7 percent this year and increase growth by 3.1 percent in 2021.[65] On 27 December 2020, the Kingdom's Ministry of Health announced more than 700,000 people had registered to receive the coronavirus vaccine since the vaccination registration campaign began on 17 December.[66] On 29 December 2020, the Kingdom's Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah, told Al Arabiya, coronavirus vaccines are set to reach all regions of Saudi Arabia within three weeks.[67] On 19 January 2021 Saudi Arabia approved AstraZeneca and also Moderna vaccines for use against the Coronavirus.[citation needed] In March 2021, Saudi Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah said that the Kingdom will provide the vaccinations to the pharmacies for free knowing that more than 100 vaccination facilities have opened around the country.[68] On March 9, the total of vaccination centres became 32 after opening 26 news centers by Asir Health Affairs.[69] On March 25, 2021, Saudi Arabia said that all domestic workers affiliated with recruitment firms in Saudi Arabia should get the vaccine. Otherwise, they have to provide a weekly negative PCR test result at the expense of the employer.[70] In April 2021, Saudi Arabia postponed the appointments of the second dose for COVID-19 vaccines in order to make sure that more residents can receive the first dose.[71] By April 14, Saudi Arabia had vaccinated 6,450,278 people.[72] In May 2021, Saudi authorities said that, starting August 2021, attending events, whether social, scientific, economic cultural or other, and entering any government or private establishment will require having the COVID-19 immunization.[73]  ","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10518","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Saudi_Arabia"}
