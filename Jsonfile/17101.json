{"Content: ":"The Czechoslovakia national football team (Czech: Československá fotbalová reprezentace, Slovak: Československé národné futbalové mužstvo) was the national football team of Czechoslovakia from 1920 to 1992. The team was controlled by the Czechoslovak Football Association, and the team qualified for eight World Cups and three European Championships. It had two runner-up finishes in World Cups, in 1934 and 1962, and won the European Championship in the 1976 tournament. At the time of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the team was participating in UEFA qualifying Group 4 for the 1994 World Cup; it completed this campaign under the name Representation of Czechs and Slovaks (RCS, Czech: Reprezentace Čechů a Slováků, Slovak: Reprezentácia Čechov a Slovákov) before it was disbanded. The present-day Czech Republic national football team is recognized as the successor of the Czechoslovakia team.[2][3] The country of Slovakia is represented by the Slovak national team. While part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bohemia played its first international on 5 April 1903, a 2\u20131 loss for Hungary in Budapest. On 7 October, Hungary came to Prague for a 4\u20134 draw. The two countries played three more matches up to 1908 \u2013 including Bohemia's only victory \u2013 and Bohemia played its last match on 13 June 1908, losing 4\u20130 at home to England.[4] After World War I, an independent Czechoslovakia entered its football team for the 1920 Olympic event in Antwerp, opening with a 7\u20130 win over Yugoslavia on 28 August. They then beat Norway 4\u20130 the next day in the quarter-finals and France 4\u20131 in the semi-finals on the 31st. However, in the final against Belgium on 2 September, the Czechoslovaks left the field 2\u20130 down after 40 minutes in protest with the English referee John Lewis, and were not given a medal.[5] Czechoslovakia returned for the 1924 Olympics in Paris and defeated Turkey 5\u20132 in the first round, but were eliminated in the second 1\u20130 against Switzerland in a replay after a 1\u20131 draw.[4] The nation entered the World Cup for the first time in 1934, and won its qualifier against Poland after its neighbour withdrew following a 2\u20131 Czechoslovak win in the first leg. At the finals in Italy, Czechoslovakia advanced past Romania, Switzerland and Germany to reach the final, where it lost 2\u20131 to the host country after extra time. Oldřich Nejedlý won the Golden Shoe with five goals in the tournament.[6] Czechoslovakia qualified for the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France with a 7\u20131 aggregate victory over Bulgaria, and reached the quarter-finals with a 3\u20130 win over the Netherlands in Le Havre. In the quarter-final against Brazil, known as the Battle of Bordeaux for its rough play, Czechoslovakia lost the replay 2\u20131.[7] In 1939, under the German occupation name of \"Bohemia\", the team played three matches, defeating Yugoslavia 7\u20133 and drawing with both Ostmark (occupied Austria) and Germany itself.[4] After an absence from the 1950 qualification campaign, Czechoslovakia qualified for 1954 by topping its qualifying group unbeaten against Bulgaria and Romania with three wins and a draw. However, in the finals in Switzerland, it was eliminated from a strong group after defeats to Uruguay and Austria.[4] It also topped its qualifying group for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, ahead of Wales and East Germany. They opened their finals campaign on 8 June with a 1\u20130 defeat to Northern Ireland in Halmstad, followed by a 2\u20132 draw with reigning champions West Germany and a 6\u20131 win over Argentina. On 17 June, Czechoslovakia lost a play-off to advance into the knockout stages 2\u20131 to Northern Ireland in Malmö.[4] On 5 April 1959, Czechoslovakia played the first ever qualifying match in a UEFA European Championship, losing 2\u20130 away to the Republic of Ireland but eventually advancing 4\u20132 on aggregate. Subsequent victories over Denmark (7\u20133 aggregate) and Romania (5\u20130 aggregate) put the country into the four-team finals in France. It lost 3\u20130 to the Soviet Union in the semi-final but gained third place with a 2\u20130 win over the hosts at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille.[8] Czechoslovakia qualified for the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile by defeating Scotland 4\u20132 after extra time in a play-off in Brussels, Belgium, after finishing level in their qualifying group. In the group at the finals, Czechoslovakia opened with a 1\u20130 win over Spain from a Jozef Štibrányi goal, and then drew 0\u20130 with holders Brazil. In the last group game on 7 June, Václav Mašek put Czechoslovakia ahead against Mexico in 12 seconds; the team lost 3\u20131 but advanced nonetheless.[9] After goalkeeper Viliam Schrojf's performance, a goal from Adolf Scherer in Rancagua was enough to beat Hungary in the quarter-final, and two more late goals by him against Yugoslavia put Czechoslovakia into their second World Cup final. In the final at the Estadio Nacional de Chile in Santiago, Josef Masopust put Czechoslovakia ahead after 15 minutes by finishing Scherer's pass, but Brazil soon equalised and exploited Schrojf's errors to win 3\u20131. Masopust's inspiration was awarded with the 1962 Ballon d'Or.[10] Czechoslovakia did not go to the 1966 FIFA World Cup, with Portugal topping their qualifying group, nor did they qualify for the European Championships of 1964 and 1968. On 3 December 1969 they defeated Hungary 4\u20131 in Marseille in a play-off to reach the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, having finished joint top of their qualifying group. Czechoslovakia lost all three of their matches in the 1970 World Cup, in a group featuring holders England and eventual winners Brazil.[4] After missing out on the 1972 European Championship and the 1974 World Cup, Czechoslovakia reached the 1976 European Championship in Yugoslavia, topping a group featuring England, Portugal and Cyprus and then defeating the Soviet Union 4\u20132 in a play-off. In the semi-final in Zagreb, they advanced after beating the Netherlands 3\u20131 after extra time. In the final on 20 June at Crvena Zvezda Stadium in Belgrade, Czechoslovakia led 2\u20130 before the game went to penalties at a 2\u20132 draw. Antonin Panenka scored the winning penalty with a chip,[11] subsequently referred to by his name when executed by other players.[12] Czechoslovakia did not qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, as Scotland won their group.[13] The country did qualify for Euro 1980, and by coming second in its group behind West Germany faced the hosts Italy in a third-place play-off, which it won on sudden-death penalties at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.[14] At the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, Czechoslovakia was eliminated in the group stage after draws with Kuwait and France and losing 2\u20130 to England. The country's last major tournament was the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, where in the group it opened with a 5\u20131 win over the United States before defeating Austria with a Michal Bilek penalty, enough to advance despite losing 2\u20130 to the hosts at the Stadio Olimpico. In the last 16 at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, a hat-trick from Tomáš Skuhravý featured in a 4\u20131 in over Costa Rica. Czechoslovakia was eliminated on 1 July in a quarter-final at the San Siro, losing 1\u20130 from a Lothar Matthäus penalty against eventual winners West Germany. Later that month, manager Dr Jozef Venglos who had led Czechoslovakia in the tournament was appointed as the first foreign manager in English football, at Aston Villa.[15]","Title":"Czechoslovakia national football team - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17101","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia_national_football_team"}
