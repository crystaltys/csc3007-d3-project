{"Content: ":"Arkéa\u2013Samsic is a UCI ProTeam cycling team based in Rennes, France that participates in UCI Continental Circuits races and UCI World Tour races when receiving a wild card. The team was founded in 2005.[4] In 2014 they received a wildcard invitation to the 2014 Tour de France.[5] In September, of the same year, the team announced they had formed a partnership with the amateur cycling team Brest Iroise Cyclisme 2000 (BIC 2000) to act as its reserve team.[6] The team took part in the 2015 Tour de France and again in 2016, having been selected as a wildcard once again.[7] For 2016 and 2017 the team was named Fortuneo Vital Concept.[8][9] On 1 June 2017 Vital Concept announced that it would cease sponsorship after 30 June. Oscaro stepped in as naming sponsor and the team became known as Fortuneo\u2013Oscaro from 1 July.[10] After six months Oscaro stepped aside, being replaced by Samsic [fr], with both naming sponsors signing deals through to the end of the 2020 season.[11] For the 2018 season onwards, the team signed the WorldTour rider Warren Barguil and built the team around him. The team is running under the name of Arkéa\u2013Samsic starting with the 2019 season.[3] For the 2020 season, the team signed former Movistar rider Nairo Quintana.[12] The team launched a women's team in 2020.[13] After the 2020 edition of the Tour de France, it was announced that an investigation into Arkéa-Samsic had been started due to suspected doping.[14] French prosecutors said there was a \"discovery of many health products including drugs (...) and especially a method that could be qualified as doping.\"[15]","Title":"Arkéa\u2013Samsic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8459","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark%C3%A9a%E2%80%93Samsic"}
