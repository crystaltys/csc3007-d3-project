{"Content: ":"Alexis Arquette (born Robert Arquette; July 28, 1969 \u2013 September 11, 2016) was an American actress. Arquette was born in Los Angeles,[1] the fourth of five children of Lewis Arquette, an actor and director,[2][3][4] and Brenda Olivia \"Mardi\" (née Nowak), a Jewish[5] actress, poet, theater operator, activist, acting teacher, and therapist. Lewis's family's surname was originally \"Arcouet\";[6] Lewis's father was comedian Cliff Arquette, who went by the stage name of Charley Weaver. Arquette was distantly related to American explorer Meriwether Lewis.[7][3] Actors Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia, and David Arquette are her siblings. In 1982, at the age of 12, Arquette's first acting gig was as \"this little kid who's on a ride with all these women and whatnot\" in the music video \"She's a Beauty\" by The Tubes.[8] In 1986, Arquette debuted on the big screen in an uncredited role as Alexis, the androgynous friend and bandmate of sexually ambivalent teenager Max Whiteman (Evan Richards) in Down and Out in Beverly Hills.[9] Arquette, in the earlier years of her career, primarily performed as a female impersonator, frequently under the name \"Eva Destruction\". Later in her career, Arquette made public that she had begun the process leading to sex reassignment surgery.[10] To this end, Arquette had publicly declared that she considered her gender to be female. At 19, Arquette played trans sex worker Georgette in the screen adaptation of Last Exit to Brooklyn.[11] The majority of Arquette's film work was in low-budget or independent films. In total, Arquette starred in more than 40 movies, including I Think I Do, Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror, and Sometimes They Come Back... Again. Arquette also starred as a crack addict opposite Tim Roth in Jumpin' at the Boneyard, as a teenage boy seeking revenge for a horrible childhood in the New Zealand-shot horror fantasy Jack Be Nimble, and as a murderous drag queen in the low budget comedy Killer Drag Queens on Dope.[12][13] Arquette also had supporting roles in Pulp Fiction, Threesome and Bride of Chucky,[14] and she played a Boy George fanatic, George Stitzer, in the Adam Sandler\u2013Drew Barrymore film The Wedding Singer, singing \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\" over and over. Her role as Georgina, a Boy George impersonator, in another Sandler\u2013Barrymore film, Blended, was a reference to that role. In 2001, Arquette returned to New Zealand to play Roman emperor Caligula in two episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess.[citation needed] That same year, Arquette guest starred in the Friends episode \"The One with Chandler's Dad\", in which she directly interacted with her sister-in-law, Courteney Cox. Also in the same year, she cameoed in Son of the Beach.[citation needed] In September 2005, VH1 announced Arquette as one of the celebrity house-guests on the 6th season of The Surreal Life. On January 31, 2007, Arquette was a featured celebrity client and guest judge on the première episode of Bravo's reality show Top Design.[15] Arquette also made a cameo appearance in the music video for Robbie Williams' song \"She's Madonna\".[16] In 2004, Arquette expressed an interest in undergoing gender-transitioning medical treatment in the form of hormone therapy and, ultimately, gender-affirming surgery. She completed her transition in 2006.[17] Her experience was documented in the film Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother, which debuted at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[18] Arquette was a vocal supporter of other transgender people, including Chaz Bono, who transitioned shortly after Arquette.[17] Arquette contracted HIV in 1987.[19] In later life, Arquette suffered from ill health as a result of being HIV-positive.[19][20][21] Amid these increasing complications, Alexis began presenting again as a man in 2013.[20] Brother David Arquette said that Alexis was \"gender suspicious\", and alternately felt like a man or a woman at different times.[22][23][24] Arquette was placed in a medically induced coma and died on September 11, 2016, surrounded by close family, at the age of 47. Arquette was serenaded with David Bowie's \"Starman\".[25][26][27] Official cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by myocarditis stemming from HIV.[19][28]","Title":"Alexis Arquette - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19537","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Arquette"}
