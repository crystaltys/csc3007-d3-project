On May 2, 2012, it was announced that Erika Christensen, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Piscopo had joined the cast of the film.[1] It was also announced that Burt Reynolds had joined the cast, but he later dropped out.[2] Principal photography began in early May 2012 in Los Angeles, California.[1] How Sweet It Is was panned by critics, receiving a 0% rating from 6 reviews on aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[3] Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: \"Brian Herzlinger's How Sweet It Is, an ode to the healing powers of musical theater, misfires so badly at the beginning that it takes a while to notice when it goes from godawful to sweetly awful. Mr. Herzlinger, who wrote the script with Jay Black, comes out swinging, with cut-rate gags and unpleasant clichés, not to mention the treacly number that plays over the opening credits.\"[4] Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times also gave a negative review, writing: \"Piscopo - one of the two break-out stars in the 1980s class of Saturday Night Live [the other was Eddie Murphy] \u2013 isn't just too good for this film, he's too good to be giving it this much effort.\"[5] Chris Packham from The Village Voice wrote: \"Like the climactic musical itself, the film pivots on silly people and absurd situations that demand total, unhinged commitment.\"[6]","Title":"How Sweet It Is (2013 film) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18664","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Sweet_It_Is_(2013_film)"}
