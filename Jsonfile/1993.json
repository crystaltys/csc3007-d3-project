{"Content: ":"The arrector pili muscles, also known as hair erector muscles,[1] are small muscles attached to hair follicles in mammals. Contraction of these muscles causes the hairs to stand on end,[2] known colloquially as goose bumps (piloerection).[3] Each arrector pili is composed of a bundle of smooth muscle fibres which attach to several follicles (a follicular unit).[4] Each is innervated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.[4] The muscle attaches to the follicular stem cell niche in the follicular bulge,[3][4][5] splitting at their deep end to encircle the follicle.[6] The contraction of the muscle is involuntary. Stresses such as cold, fear etc. may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, and thus cause muscle contraction.[4] Contraction of arrector pili muscles have a principal function in the majority of mammals of providing thermal insulation.[4] Air becomes trapped between the erect hairs, helping the animal retain heat. Erection of the porcupine's long, thick hairs causes the animal to become more intimidating, scaring predators.[citation needed] Pressure exerted by the muscle may cause sebum to be forced along the hair follicle towards the surface, protecting the hair.[7] Arrector pili muscles also stabilise the base of the hair follicle.[5][6] Skin conditions such as leprosy can damage arrector pili muscles, preventing their contraction.[8] The term \"arrector pili\" comes from Latin. It translates to \"hair erector\".[1] Insertion of sebaceous glands into hair shaft Cross-section of all skin layers","Title":"Arrector pili muscle - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1993","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrector_pili"}
