{"Content: ":"The role of open-source intelligence (OSINT) in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has attracted significant attention.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Open-source intelligence (also known by its acronym OSINT) refers to the gathering and analysis of intelligence based on publicly available sources of information. In the early hours of 24 February, just before the start of the invasion, OSINT researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey used Google Maps to track a significantly large traffic jam on a road in Russia leading to the Ukrainian border. Jeffrey Lewis subsequently tweeted \"someone\u2019s on the move.\" An hour later, Russian troops began the invasion.[7][8] Netherlands-based investigative journalism group Bellingcat has published interactive maps of destroyed civilian targets and has worked on authenticating potential documentation of war crimes.[9][10][11] Oryx gained international prominence through its work during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, counting and keeping track of material losses based on visual evidence and OSINT from social media.[12][13][14] It has been regularly cited in major media, including Reuters,[15] BBC News,[16] The Guardian,[17] The Economist,[18] Newsweek,[19] CNN,[20] and CBS News.[21] Forbes has called Oryx \"the most reliable source in the conflict so far\", calling its services \"outstanding\".[22][23][24] Because it reports only visually confirmed losses, Oryx's tallies of equipment losses have formed absolute minimum baselines for loss estimates.[25][26]","Title":"Open-source intelligence in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16375","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine"}
