{"Content: ":"The 1999 Istanbul Summit was the 6th Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) summit and was held in Istanbul, Turkey from November 18 until November 19, resulting in the adoption of the Istanbul Summit Declaration and the signing of the Charter for European Security.[1] Also in Istanbul, 30 OSCE states signed the Agreement on the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which amended the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe to reflect the changes since the end of the Cold War. There was a verbal clash between Russia and the West concerning NATO intervention in the Kosovo Conflict and the beginning of the Second Chechen War. The Transnistria conflict, the Abkhaz\u2013Georgian conflict and the Georgian\u2013Ossetian conflict were also discussed.
