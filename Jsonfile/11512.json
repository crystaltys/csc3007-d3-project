{"Content: ":"In biology, a monotypic taxon is a taxonomic group (taxon) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon.[1] A monotypic species is one that does not include subspecies or smaller, infraspecific taxa. In the case of genera, the term \"unispecific\" or \"monospecific\" is sometimes preferred. In botanical nomenclature, a monotypic genus is a genus in the special case where a genus and a single species are simultaneously described.[2] In contrast an oligotypic taxon contains more than one but only a very few subordinate taxa. Just as the term monotypic is used to describe a taxon including only one subdivision, the contained taxon can also be referred to as monotypic within the higher-level taxon, e.g. a genus monotypic within a family. Some examples of monotypic groups are: In the order Amborellales, there is only one family, Amborellaceae and there is only one genus, Amborella , and in this genus there is only one species, namely Amborella trichopoda. Beluga \u201ckissing\u201d a human trainer, both are monotypical in their genera. The family Cephalotaceae has only one genus, Cephalotus, which contains only one species, Cephalotus follicularis, the Australian pitcher plant.","Title":"Monotypic taxon - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11512","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_taxon"}
