Following a three-year stint with the Rabobank Continental Team, van Baarle signed with Garmin\u2013Sharp, for the 2014 and 2015 seasons.[9][10] In 2014, van Baarle won the Tour of Britain; he gained the yellow jersey on the seventh stage, and successfully defended the jersey on the eighth and final stage.[11][12] He was named in the start list for the 2015 Tour de France.[13] Between 2015-2020 Van Baarle had some high places, consistently in the Tour of Flanders, but no major wins aside from the ITT in the 2018 National Championships. In early 2021 he won Dwars door Vlaanderen and late in the year took 2nd in the UCI World Championships. A week later he entered 2021 Paris-Roubaix, which was rescheduled due to the Covid pandemic, and finished outside the time limit. Also in 2021 he started and finished the Tour de France for the 6th time. In 2022 he had his best ever finish in a Cycling monument when he finished 2nd in the race where he had always had good results, the Tour of Flanders. A few weeks later he won his first Monument when he launched a successful solo attack in Paris-Roubaix, finishing nearly two minutes ahead of 2nd place Wout Van Aert.[14]","Title":"Dylan van Baarle - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8552","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_van_Baarle"}
