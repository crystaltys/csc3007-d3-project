It runs Guy's Hospital in London Bridge, St Thomas' Hospital in Waterloo, Evelina London Children's Hospital, two specialist heart and lung hospitals, Royal Brompton and Harefield and community services in Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. Guy's Hospital was first established as an NHS Trust including University Hospital Lewisham but in 1993 Lewisham became independent and Guy's and St Thomas' joined together.[2] In December 2013 it was announced that a proposed merger with King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust foundation trusts had been suspended because of doubts about the reaction of the Competition Commission.[3] In 2019 it was closely involved with Kings, with which it shares its chair, Sir Hugh Taylor, its strategy director and IT director. In 2013 the Trust established a unique multidisciplinary consultancy now called Lexica, that enables public and private sector organisations to transform their environments to create better health. Lexica re-invest profits within the Trust. Lexica provides specialist advisory services in health and life science sectors across healthcare strategy + planning, property, cost, project and programme management, Net Zero and infrastructure solutions.

The first one opened in April 2019.[8] This was part of a plan for an Orthopaedic Centre of Excellence in a deal worth up to £310 million, but the plan was dropped in 2022 because of the \u2018impact of covid\u2019.[9] The Trust offers a range of services privately including assisted conception, services for children and maternity. Other complex care specialties including cardiology, vascular and thoracic surgery, gynaecology, general surgery and medicine are available at the Westminster Unit.

The Trust built a £100 million integrated cancer centre in conjunction with HCA Healthcare near London Bridge in 2016.[10] The Trust entered into a contract with Johnson & Johnson in November 2017 for £310 million thought to run for 10 years. It includes a \"managed service agreement\" for the procurement of prosthetics, surgical instruments and other consumables for orthopaedic surgery and the development of eight new operating theatres on the Guy's hospital site.[11]","Title":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9759","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy%27s_and_St_Thomas%27_NHS_Foundation_Trust"}
