{"Content: ":"CIS Member State The chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Kyrgyzstan (Russian: Председатель Кабинета министров Киргизской Республики; Kyrgyz: Кыргыз Республикасынын Министрлер Кабинетинин төрагасы, romanized: Kyrgyz Respublikasynyn Ministrler Kabinetinin Töragasy), formerly known as the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz: Кыргыз Республикасынын премьер-министри, romanized: Kyrgyz Respublikasynyn premyer-ministri) chairs the Cabinet of Ministers of the Kyrgyz Republic. Until 2010, the president was in a stronger position than the prime minister in Kyrgyzstan, but after the 2010 constitutional referendum, the state transitioned to a parliamentary system, placing greater power in parliament and the cabinet at the expense of the president. This was reverted in 2021 after the Kyrgyz constitutional referendum. Kubatbek Boronov was the acting prime minister from 16 June 2020, succeeding Muhammetkaliy Abulgaziyev after his resignation due to his cabinet's heavy corruption case. Following election protests, Boronov resigned and was replaced on 6 October 2020 by Sadyr Japarov and again by Artem Novikov on 14 November 2020 to 3 February 2021.
