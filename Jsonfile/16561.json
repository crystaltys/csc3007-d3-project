{"Content: ":"Valery Dmitrievitch Bolotov (Russian: Вале́рий Дми́триевич Бо́лотов, IPA: [vɐˈlʲerʲɪj ˈdmʲitrʲɪjɪvʲɪdʑ ˈbolətəf]; Ukrainian: Вале́рій Дми́трович Бо́лотов; 13 February 1970 \u2013 27 January 2017)[1] was a Ukrainian leader known for his involvement in the Donbas War in eastern Ukraine, and as the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic. Little is known about Bolotov's life prior to 2014; in a video of him voting in a local referendum, he presents a Ukrainian passport which indicates that he was born in Taganrog, Rostov Oblast on 13 February 1970. In 1974, he moved to Stakhanov, in the Luhansk Oblast, eastern Ukraine.[2] Bolotov claimed to be a senior sergeant of the Soviet Airborne Troops in Vitebsk (presumably the 103rd Guards Airborne Division), and between 1989 and 1990 participated in a number of conflicts, including those in Tbilisi, Yerevan and Karabakh.[3] He later became the head of the airborne veterans group, while no one of the Luhansk Oblast group cell can confirm it.[3] Bolotov worked as a manager and director at a meat factory and used to run a small business.[2] Before the pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Bolotov was a representative of Oleksandr Yefremov who supervised illegal mining in the region.[4] In 2014, Bolotov became a leader of an armed group during the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. On May 13, 2014, Bolotov survived an assassination attempt as assailants fired automatic weapons towards his car, wounding the militant leader.[5] Bolotov was then briefly captured by the Ukrainian army on May 17 after he attempted to re-enter Luhansk following his having received treatment for his injury at a hospital in Russia.[6] However, armed supporters of the Luhansk People's Republic attacked the Ukrainian army checkpoint where Bolotov was being held shortly afterwards and successfully freed the \"People's Governor\".[6] He resigned from the position on 14 August 2014.[7] Bolotov was found dead on 27 January 2017 in his own home in Moscow, Russia.[1] The causes of his death are currently being investigated.[needs update] The preliminary results of clinical tests showed an acute heart failure as reason of death.[8][9][10] His wife later claimed that he may have been poisoned.[11] Though more detailed report of the local police office claimed that there were no obvious signs of the acute heart failure and only small atherosclerotic plaques were identified instead.[12] It is known that before death he was complaining to his wife about his health deterioration which happened right after drinking a cup of coffee at the business meeting in company with two men he allegedly knew.[13] It became later known that Bolotov met with ex-speaker of the People's council of the LNR Alexey Karyakin and Valery Alexandrovich as Valery had said and added also that the meeting was appointed by request of Bolotov himself.[14] Bolotov's corpse was later tested for the presence of the poisoning drugs in his body at the request of his wife, but as of 2018 the results are unknown.[12] Bolotov was married and had two children.[3]","Title":"Valery Bolotov - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16561","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Bolotov"}
