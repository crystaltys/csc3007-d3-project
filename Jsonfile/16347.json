With Russia's membership valid through 2023,[13] the Russian delegation announced it had quit the Human Rights Council earlier that day in expectation of the vote.[14]","Title":"United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/3 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16347","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-11/3"}
