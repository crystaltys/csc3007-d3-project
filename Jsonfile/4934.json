{"Content: ":"The Christian Party was an American fascist political party founded by William Dudley Pelley in 1935.[1] He chose the 16 August 1935 as the founding date, because it was a so-called \"pyramid date\".[2] The party can be considered the political wing of Pelley's paramilitary organization, the Silver Legion of America. It ran with Pelley as its candidate for the 1936 presidential campaign[3] (Silver Legion member Willard Kemp was the vice presidential candidate). Pelley gained just 1,600 votes in the election.[4] The party was quickly dissolved after the United States entered World War II. There is also a current Christian Party that was founded in 2009 by a group of self-described \"Christian Constitutionalist patriots\"[5] in Mobile, Alabama.
