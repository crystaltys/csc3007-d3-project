{"Content: ":"The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, also known as the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is a standing committee of the U.S. House of Representatives with jurisdiction over bills and investigations concerning the foreign affairs of the United States.[1] Since 2021, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee has been Gregory Meeks of New York. The Committee has a broad mandate to oversee legislation regarding the impact of national security developments on foreign policy; war powers, treaties, executive agreements, and military deployments abroad; foreign assistance; arms control; international economic policy; and other matters.[1] Many of its responsibilities are delegated to one of six standing subcommittees, which have jurisdiction over issues related to their respective region in the world. The Committee also oversees the U.S. Department of State, American embassies and diplomats, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. During two separate periods, 1975 to 1978 and 1995 to 2007, the Foreign Affairs Committee was renamed the Committee on International Relations;[2] its duties and jurisdiction remained unchanged. Its counterpart in the Senate is the Committee on Foreign Relations.
