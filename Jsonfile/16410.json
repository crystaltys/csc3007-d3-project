{"Content: ":"Saint Javelin is a concept meme depicting various religious figures carrying the FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank weapon that has become popular as a \"meme of resistance\" during the Russo-Ukrainian War. The meme was started initially by Christian Borys and became famous around the world, eventually resulting in other similar memes. The meme boosted morale and was used in merchandise products, resulting in more than a million dollars being raised to assist humanitarian charities assisting Ukraine after it was invaded by Russia in 2022. The meme was invented by Journalist Christian Borys who is Ukrainian-Polish Canadian, initially as a lightweight meme for use on stickers. Borys had worked extensively with a particular Ukrainian charity and decided to make a brand that may assist the charity.[1][2] Borys is currently based in Toronto but had previously been based in Ukraine as a journalist, in the initial conflict from 2014. While there he freelanced for various countries, and was particularly moved by the plight of orphans and widows from the Donbass secessionist conflict.[3] The meme itself depicts a stylised Madonna (mistakenly claimed to be Mary Magdalene or based on Saint Olga of Kiev by some sources),[4][5][6][7] cradling a rocket launcher. The Virgin Mary, as depicted in the promotional campaign, is represented in a traditional Orthodox icon style.[8] Whilst in the standard artistic Madonna, Mary would often (but not always) be depicted cradling the baby Jesus in her arms, in this case, she is instead cradling an anti tank weapon. The humour of the meme is the unlikely circumstance of Mary, the Mother of God, in traditional 1st century AD clothing and style, destroying Russian Main battle tanks with a modern anti-tank weapon.[9] The weapon depicted is a US-made FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank weapon, that has been donated in large numbers and seeing active use in Ukraine against Russian armour. It is commonly known as a \"Javelin\".[10] Generally in recent art, The Maddona and other traditional figures have been depicted in similar fashion, holding modern items that contrast with the traditional representation of the religious figure, including sneakers, gold plated AK 47s, etc.[11] Rather than traditional coloured robes, hers are dark green to resemble military clothing, and while her halo was red in an earlier version, it was later changed to blue and yellow, to represent Ukraine.[12] The meme has got mainstream popularity to the point where it has become a bona-fide recognised symbol of Ukrainian resistance.[13] The design was created by Ukrainian graphic designer Evgeniy Shalashov, who is based in Lviv and was employed by Borys. It is an adaptation of a 2012 painting by US artist Chris Shaw, that was already well known. Shaw himself was suprised to find in February of 2022, he \u201cwoke up to find an image of \u2018Saint Javelin\u2019 going viral all over the internet as a meme,\u201d a digital alteration of his 2012 painting, \u201cMadonna Kalashnikov.\u201d Shaw noted that the alteration was done without his permission, but has also stated that it is used for charity so the results are positive.[14] The campaign while initially small, became popular and broadened its reach to raise, up until March 2022, $1.1 million dollars.[15][16][17] Christian Borys helped develop the image - known as \"Saint Javelin\" - which depicts the Virgin Mary cradling a US-made FGM-148 anti-tank weapon. These missiles are among the arms being sent by Western allies to Ukrainian forces to aid in their fight. The marketer and ex-journalist has stated that the response to the campaign, which sells the image on everything from tote bags to sweatshirts, flags and stickers, has been \"overwhelming\", with thousands of orders coming in each day.[18][19] All the money from these sales goes directly to charities that assist Ukraine. As of March 2022, he had plans for the \"Saint Javelin\" campaign to become a full-time effort and hoped to hire permanent staff so it can continue to support reconstruction efforts for decades after the current conflict ends. Borys did the initial effort before the full invasion, on the 7th of December 2021.[20] He thought of the meme as a humourous way of simply selling stickers, and expected to sell 50 or so, to be able to make a small donation of $500. After Russian troops invaded, the world's attention turned to the conflict, and he had very quickly raised $40,000 in a short period.[21] The campaign also included other \"saints\", holding various other weapons, including a German saint wielding a German anti tank weapon \"Saint Panzerfaust\" and The Madonna wielding a British anti tank weapon \"Saint NLAW\". The meme has joined other pro Ukraine memes of resistance made popular by the internet, including \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself\".[22]","Title":"Saint Javelin - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16410","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Javelin"}
