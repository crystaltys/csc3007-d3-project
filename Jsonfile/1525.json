{"Content: ":"Gavialidae is a family of large semiaquatic crocodilians with elongated, narrow snouts. Gavialidae consists of two living species, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii), both occurring in Asia. Many extinct members are known from a broader range, including the recently extinct Hanyusuchus. Gavialids are generally regarded as lacking the jaw strength to capture the large mammalian prey favoured by crocodiles and alligators of similar size so their thin snout is best used to catch fish, however the false gharial has been found to have a generalist diet with mature adults preying upon larger vertebrates.[1] The family Gavialidae was proposed by Arthur Adams in 1854 for reptiles with a very long and slender muzzle, webbed feet and nearly equal teeth.[2] It is currently recognized as a crown group,[3] meaning that it only includes the last common ancestor of all extant (living) gavialids (the gharial and false gharial) and their descendants (living or extinct). Traditionally, crocodiles and alligators were considered more closely related and grouped together in the clade Brevirostres, to the exclusion of the gharials. This classification was based on morphological studies primarily focused on analyzing skeletal traits of living and extinct fossil species.[4] However, recent molecular studies using DNA sequencing have rejected Brevirostres upon finding the crocodiles and gavialids to be more closely related than the alligators.[5][6][7][3][8] The new clade Longirostres was named by Harshman et al. in 2003.[5] In addition, these recent molecular DNA studies consistently indicate that the false gharial (Tomistoma) (and by inference other related extinct forms) traditionally viewed as belonging to the crocodylian subfamily Tomistominae actually belong to Gavialoidea (and Gavialidae).[5][9][10][6][7][3][8] As its name suggests, the false gharial was once thought to be only distantly related to the gharial despite its similar appearance. The false gharial and other tomistomines were traditionally classified within the superfamily Crocodyloidea as close relatives of crocodiles, based solely on morphological evidence.[9] A 2018 tip dating study by Lee & Yates simultaneously using morphological, molecular (DNA sequencing), and stratigraphic (fossil age) data established the inter-relationships within Crocodilia,[3] which was expanded upon in 2021 by Hekkala et al. using paleogenomics by extracting DNA from the extinct Voay.[8] The tip dating analysis resolved the extinct Thoracosaurus and similar extinct close relatives (\"thoracosaurs\") as outside of Gavialoidea due to the large time difference. They concluded that that the only possible explanation for the morpholigcal data placing thoracosaurs within the gharial lineage was a significant amount of homoplastic convergence between thoracosaurs and Gavialis.[3] The below cladogram from latest study shows Gavialidae's placement within Crocodylia: extinct basal Alligatoroids\u2020 Caiman Melanosuchus Paleosuchus Alligator \"Crocodylus\" megarhinus\u2020 Crocodylus Mecistops Osteolaemus Kentisuchus\u2020 Maroccosuchus\u2020 Paratomistoma\u2020 Dollosuchoides\u2020 Tomistoma cairense\u2020 Gavialis Tomistoma Here is a more detailed cladogram that shows the proposed phylogeny of Gavialidae including extinct members:[11] Crocodyloidea \u2020Maroccosuchus zennaroi \u2020Megadontosuchus arduini \u2020Dollosuchoides densmorei \u2020Xaymacachampsa kugleri \u2020Kentisuchus astrei \u2020Kentisuchus spenceri \u2020Tomistoma cairense \u2020Tomistoma coppensi \u2020Maomingosuchus petrolica Tomistoma schlegelii, false gharial \u2020Tomistoma lusitanica \u2020Gavialosuchus eggenburgensis \u2020Melitosaurus champsoides \u2020Tomistoma calaritanum \u2020Tomistoma gaudense \u2020Thecachampsa carolinensis \u2020Thecachampsa antiqua \u2020Paratomistoma courti \u2020Penghusuchus pani \u2020Toyotamaphimeia machikanensis \u2020Hanyusuchus sinensis \u2020Eosuchus lerichei \u2020Eosuchus minor \u2020Ocepesuchus eoafricanus \u2020Eothoracosaurus mississippiensis \u2020Thoracosaurus macrorhynchus \u2020Thoracosaurus neocesariensis \u2020Aktiogavialis puertoricensis \u2020Eogavialis africanum \u2020Argochampsa krebsi \u2020Piscogavialis jugaliperforatus \u2020Ikanogavialis gameroi \u2020Siquisiquesuchus venezuelensis \u2020Dadagavialis gunai \u2020Gryposuchus neogaeus \u2020Gryposuchus croizati \u2020Aktiogavialis caribesi \u2020Gryposuchus pachakamue \u2020Gryposuchus colombianus \u2020Rhamphosuchus crassidens \u2020Myanmar gavialid \u2020Gavialis lewisi \u2020Gavialis bengawanicus Gavialis gangeticus, gharial \u2020Siwalik Gavialis  Family Gavialidae \u2020 Indicates extinct group","Title":"Gavialidae - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1525","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavialidae"}
