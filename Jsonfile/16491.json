{"Content: ":"Ukrainian Armed Forces Attacks on civilians The Battles of Sievierodonetsk were a series of battles between Ukrainian troops and Luhansk People's Republic formations during the War in Donbas in and around the Eastern Ukrainian cluster of cities of Rubizhne, Lysychansk, and Sieverodonetsk for control. Although the battle derives its namesake from the city, there was no fighting in Sieverodonetsk itself, in comparison to the successive battle in 2022. On 22 May 2014 a convoy from the 30th Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the city of Rubezhnoye. After that, it turned towards Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Along the way, the convoy was fired upon with grenade launchers and small arms by LPR separatists from the detachment Pavel Leonidovich Dryomov [ru]. During the battle, Ukrainian Armed Forces lost two infantry fighting vehicles and a cargo Ural with an anti-aircraft gun in the back.[citation needed] At the end of May 2014, there was heavy fighting between LPR separatists and units of the National Guard of Ukraine. The media reported on the use by the Ukrainian army of mortars, howitzers, Tulpan self-propelled mortars and Grad multiple launch rocket systems. On 22 July 2014 the LPR separatists retreated from Severodonetsk. Units of the National Guard of Ukraine entered the city.[1][2] As of 23 July 2014, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard of Ukraine continued to engage in street fighting with the separatists. According to the fighters of the National Guard, they found one howitzer, more than 50 kilograms of plastids, 15 high-explosive shells and other ammunition in the city.[3] The fighting continued until 24 July, when in the city of Lisichansk, a Colonel of the NSU[clarification needed] Alexander Vitalyevich Radievsky [ru], who was posthumously awarded the rank of Major General, was killed by separatists[citation needed].
