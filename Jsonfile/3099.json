{"Content: ":"Tokio Hotel is a German rock band, founded in 2001 by singer Bill Kaulitz, guitarist Tom Kaulitz, drummer Gustav Schäfer, and bassist Georg Listing.[10] Their sound encompasses multiple genres, including pop rock, alternative rock, and electronic rock. They have had four number one singles and have released three number one albums in their native country. The band has sold more than 10 million records worldwide.[11] After recording an unreleased demo-album under the name \"Devilish\" and having their contract with Sony BMG Germany terminated, the band released their first German-language album, Schrei, as Tokio Hotel on Universal Music Germany in 2005. Schrei sold more than half-a-million copies worldwide[12] and spawned four top-five singles in both Germany and Austria. In 2007, the band released their second German-language album, Zimmer 483, and their first English-language album, Scream, which have combined album sales of over 2.5 million copies worldwide and helped win the band their first MTV Europe Music Award for Best InterAct. The former, Zimmer 483, spawned three top-five singles in Germany while the latter, Scream, spawned two singles that reached the top-twenty in new territories such as France, Portugal, Spain and Italy. In September 2008, they won their first MTV Video Music Award, for Best New Artist. Tokio Hotel became the first German band ever to win an award at the MTV VMAs and to also win awards at the MTV Latin America Awards. They also picked up the Headliner award at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and the award for Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009. They won for Best World Stage Performance on 7 November 2010 at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Madrid. In July 2011, they became the first German band to win an award at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan. Their most recent work is the 2017 album Dream Machine, which received mixed reviews. Twin brothers Bill Kaulitz and Tom Kaulitz along with drummer Gustav Schäfer and bass-guitarist Georg Listing formed the band in 2001[13][14] under the name Devilish, and they soon began playing in talent shows and small concerts.[15] After Bill Kaulitz's participation in a children's Star Search in 2003 at age thirteen (which he lost in the quarter-final), he was discovered by music producer Peter Hoffmann. Devilish changed their name to Tokio Hotel: \"Tokio\", the German spelling of the Japanese city Tokyo, due to a love of the city, and \"Hotel\" due to their constant touring and living in hotels.[13] Soon after Sony BMG took them under contract, Hoffmann hired David Jost and Pat Benzner into the team of creators and authors, and had them give the teens instruction on songwriting and instrument playing; most of the songs of the first album were written by Hoffmann, Jost and Benzer (including the singles \"Scream\" and \"Rescue me\" which were completely written by them), only the single \"Unendlichkeit\" was written completely by Tokio Hotel themselves. Shortly before release of their first album, Sony terminated their contract. In 2005 Universal Music Group took Tokio Hotel under contract and developed a marketing plan. Their first single, \"Durch den Monsun\" (\"Through the Monsoon\"), quickly rose in the charts, appearing on the German official Media Control single chart at No. 15 on 20 August 2005 and eventually reaching No. 1 on 26 August 2005; it also reached No. 1 on the Austrian singles chart. Their second single, \"Schrei\" (\"Scream\"), climbed to the No. 5 position in the German charts. These two songs were written by singer Bill Kaulitz together with their group of producers Peter Hoffmann, David Jost, Pat Benzer and Dave Roth. Their debut album, Schrei, was released on 19 September 2005, and was certified triple gold by the BVMI in 2006 for selling over 300,000 copies in Germany.[16] In 2006, a third and fourth single, \"Rette mich\" (\"Rescue Me\") and \"Der letzte Tag\" (\"The Final Day\"), were released; both reached No. 1 as well. \"Der letzte Tag\" contained a B-side called \"Wir schließen uns ein\", which was also accompanied by a music video. The first single off their second album Zimmer 483 (Room 483), called \"Übers Ende der Welt\" (later re-released in English under the name \"Ready, Set, Go!\"), was released on 26 January 2007 and quickly reached No. 1 in Germany and Austria, and No. 2 in France. Zimmer 483 was released in Germany on 23 February 2007, along with a deluxe edition of the album containing a DVD. The album's second single, \"Spring nicht\" (\"Don't Jump\") was released on 7 April. The tour accompanying the release of the album, The Zimmer 483 Tour, scheduled to start in March 2007, was delayed by two weeks because the band members wished to have a different stage design. A third single, \"An deiner Seite (Ich bin da)\" (\"By Your Side\"), was released on 16 November. The single contains the B-side \"1000 Meere\" (\"1000 Oceans\"), for which a music video was also produced.[by whom?] On 28 April 2008 Tokio Hotel released their single \"Heilig\" but no music video for the single was released, because of the tight schedule they had. Tokio Hotel's first English-language album, Scream, was released on 4 June 2007 throughout Europe. In Germany, the album was released as Room 483 in order to emphasize the continuity with their last German album Zimmer 483. Scream contains English versions of a selection of songs from Tokio Hotel's German-language albums Schrei and Zimmer 483. \"Monsoon\", the English-language version of \"Durch den Monsun\", was the first single from the album. \"Ready, Set, Go!\" (the translation of \"Übers Ende der Welt\") was released as the album's second single and \"Don't Jump\" (the translation of \"Spring nicht\") as the third single. A video for \"Scream\", the English-language version of their 2005 hit \"Schrei\", was also recorded, and was released to the iTunes Store in early March 2008. Tokio Hotel gave their first concert in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2007. \"Ready, Set, Go!\" was released in the UK as the band's first single on 27 August 2007. The song reached No. 77 in the UK Singles Chart. Tokio Hotel won an MTV Europe Music Award for Best InterAct on 1 November 2007 and were also nominated for Best Band. They performed \"Monsoon\" at the event. Tokio Hotel released their first US single, simply called \"Tokio Hotel\", in late 2007. The single contains the tracks \"Scream\" and \"Ready, Set, Go!\", and was available exclusively at Hot Topic stores. Their second US single, \"Scream America\", was released on 11 December 2007. The single contains the track \"Scream\" and a remix of \"Ready, Set, Go!\" by AFI's Jade Puget. In February 2008, the band toured North America for five dates, starting in Canada and finishing up in New York.[3] After Tokio Hotel had appeared and performed live on MuchMusic while touring in Canada, \"Ready, Set, Go!\" entered the MuchOnDemand Daily 10, a countdown of videos chosen by viewers. It remained there for over a week, then returned to the top of the MOD Daily 10 chart on 8 April. \"Scream\" was released in Canada on 25 March and in the US on 6 May. The \"1000 Hotels\" European Tour began on 3 March 2008 in Brussels and continued through locations including the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Serbia and Scandinavia. It was scheduled to finish on 9 April; during the concert in Marseille, France, on 14 March, Bill started to experience vocal problems.[17] He let the audience sing more frequently than normal, and instead of the original 21 songs on the set list, the band played only 16 songs. Bill apologized, in German, for his bad singing and explained that he was sick. Two days later, the band cancelled the Lisbon, Portugal concert minutes before it was supposed to commence. The rest of the \"1000 Hotels\" Tour and a scheduled North American Tour were cancelled after the band's manager announced in Bild that Bill Kaulitz had to undergo surgery to remove a cyst on his vocal cords.[18][19] Bill Kaulitz had been putting strain on his voice after playing 43 concerts in the 1000 Hotels tour without a break.[20] He had to undergo larynx surgery on 30 March to remove a cyst that had formed on his vocal cords.[21] The cyst resulted from a throat infection that had gone untreated.[22] Following his surgery Bill could not speak for ten days and had four weeks of vocal rehabilitation.[23] If Bill had continued singing the rest of the tour, his voice would have eventually been permanently damaged.[17][24] Tokio Hotel started performing again in May 2008[25] and after that they embarked on a second part of their 1000 Hotels European Tour, adding many open-air concerts and wrapping up the tour on 13 July in Werchter in Belgium. In August 2008 Tokio Hotel embarked on a second tour of North America, including a performance at the Bamboozled festival in New Jersey. The band's music video for \"Ready Set Go!\" was nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards,[26] where they won the award for Best New Artist.[27] They returned to North America in October 2008 for a month-long tour of concerts and record-store signings. In December 2008 a behind-the-scenes DVD called Tokio Hotel TV \u2013 Caught on Camera was released. It contains footage from Tokio Hotel TV and backstage feature-stories of the previous year on disc one entitled \"History \u2013 The very best of Tokio Hotel TV!\". A deluxe edition contains a second disc entitled \"Future \u2013 The road to the new Album!\" which features footage of the band on promotion tours and preparing for their third studio album.[28] In between the North American tours, the band returned to their record studio in Hamburg to record their third studio album, Humanoid, which was released on 2 October in Germany and 6 October 2009 in the U.S.,[29][30][31] despite earlier statements predicting a March/April 2009 release or a May/June 2009 release.[32][33][34] The album was recorded in both German and English, with both versions released simultaneously worldwide.[33][34] On 10 August, it was announced on MTV News that the first German single would be \"Automatisch\" and that its English counterpart, \"Automatic\", would be released as a first single in the United States. On 20 August, MTV Buzzworthy released a video which previewed \"Automatic\" and Cherrytree Records announced that the English version of the song would be released in the US on 22 September.[35][36] Nevertheless, the video for the single was released on 3 September. On 2 November 2009 Tom's blog announced that the second English single would be \"World Behind My Wall\" and that its German counterpart, \"Lass uns laufen\", would be the second German single.[37] The music videos for both versions were released on 14 and 15 December. The group toured thirty-two cities in Europe from 22 February to 14 April 2010. On 24 June 2010, the live music-video for their single, \"Dark Side of the Sun\", was released on the band website. On 20 July 2010, they released their second live album, Humanoid City Live, from Milan, Italy. On 22 November 2010, their new song \"Hurricanes and Suns\" premiered on the Greek radio-station Mad Radio. It was included in the bonus track on all versions of Tokio Hotel: Best Of, a compilation album of their most successful songs. On 13 December 2010 their Best of was released in Germany. It was released internationally the next day. 2 December was the World Premiere of the video for \"Hurricanes and Suns\" on the official Tokio Hotel website. Tokio Hotel performed their first concert in Asia (excluding their concert in Israel) at the Audi Showcase in Singapore, followed shortly by the TM Connects With Tokio Hotel event in Malaysia, promoting the sales of their album Humanoid.

They performed in Tokyo on 15 December 2010, after their South American tour concluded in Distrito Federal, Mexico on 2 December 2010. In February 2011 Tokio Hotel travelled to Japan to complete a second promo tour. A number of television appearances and media interviews took place between 8 and 11 February. On 28 April 2011 they received the \"Fan Army FTW\" award at the MTV O Music Awards, the network's first online award-show. A clip of Bill and Tom thanking their fans played after the winner was announced. On 24 June 2011 Tokio Hotel performed in Japan at \"The Next Premium Night Tokio Hotel in Tokyo\". Audi A1 presented the event, and 150 fans were chosen to win tickets to attend the show. The event was the band's first acoustic performance in Japan. On 25 June 2011 the band performed live at the MTV Video Music Aid Japan in Tokyo. The show, formerly called the \"Video Music Awards Japan\", was used as a music benefit to raise money for the Japanese Red Cross in order to help those affected by the 2011 earthquake. Not long after finishing the \"Welcome to Humanoid City Tour\", Bill and Tom, with their manager David Jost, moved to Los Angeles and continue to live there. On 18 May 2012 Far East Movement released an album named \"Dirty Bass\", featuring the song \"If I Die Tomorrow\", which includes vocals by Bill. On 5 January 2013, Tom Kaulitz confirmed on the \"BTK Twins\" app (which was recalled in November) that a new album would be released in 2013.[38] During MTV's Musical March Madness 2013 Tournament, Tokio Hotel promised to release their new album \"if they repeat as March Madness Champs\".[39] Although they did not win the award, and despite inactivity, the band managed to gather a considerable amount of support from their fanbase. Once again, Tokio Hotel announced that they were planning to release a new single on 27 October 2013 and the album the following month.[40] However, neither the album nor any new singles were released during that year. On 22 January 2014, the band's producer, Peter Hoffman, announced that recording for the new album had been completed and that they were in the process of selecting the track list. He stated that there was no release date yet, but the album would come out later in 2014.[41] On 3 April, the band informed their fans via Facebook and Twitter about their recent website update, which included an official video teaser of them working on their upcoming album and never-before-seen photos of the members.[42] After the comeback of Tokio Hotel TV, the band announced on Twitter that the album had been finished and was currently in the hands of the label.[43] On 3 September 2014 Bill Kaulitz announced via his Instagram account that the name of the new album would be Kings of Suburbia and it would be released on 3 October.[44] On 12 September, Tokio Hotel released a music video for the song \"Run, Run, Run\" from their new album.[45] \"Girl Got a Gun\" was also released as a second promotional song on 19 September, followed by a music video on 23 September.

The band had only completed three venues on their North America and Latin America tour and the rest of the tour was since cancelled at the last minute before their show in Ecuador due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns worldwide. All photos, videos and content were removed from Tokio Hotel's official Instagram account early August 2020, and older photos of the band were uploaded instead. This was later revealed to be due to the 15th anniversary of the release of the band's debut single \"Durch den Monsun\" on 15 August 2005. During a live chat on Spotify, the band confirmed that new versions of \"Durch den Monsun\" and \"Monsoon\" will be released some time in Autumn 2020 as a celebration of the single's 15th anniversary. \"Durch den Monsun 2020\" and \"Monsoon 2020\" were respectively released on 2 October 2020[49] and 16 October 2020.[50] Bill also confirmed that a new German-language song will be released later this year, and that a new tour is planned in 2021 for Europe and other continents.

On 6 March 2022 the band postponed their Beyond the World Tour until Spring 2023 in the wake of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. A message written on their official Instagram page reads: \"Dear Aliens, we are currently discussing on a daily basis what is appropriate to share and how to carry on with our music.
