{"Content: ":"Saurichthyiformes is an extinct order of ray-finned fish which existed in Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and North America, during the late Permian to early Middle Jurassic.[1][2][3][4] Saurichthyiiformes comprise two families, Saurichthyidae and Yelangichthyidae. Whereas Yelangichthyidae is monotypic, Saurichthyidae includes at least two genera, Saurorhynchus and the very speciose Saurichthys.[5] Additionally, the subgenera Costasaurichthys, Eosaurichthys, Lepidosaurichthys, and Sinosaurichthys are frequently used to group species. Saurichthyiforms were highly successful predators, and with Yelangichthys possibly even included durophagous forms. Species are known from both marine end freshwater deposits. They had their highest diversity during the Early and Middle Triassic.[6] Modified from Maxwell et al.[21] (also see Renesto et al.[22], Argyriou et al.[23] and Gardiner et al.[24]) Neopterygii Acipenseriformes? \u2020Birgeria \u2020Yelangichthyidae \u2020Eosaurichthys \u2020Lepidosaurichthys \u2020Saurichthys rieppeli \u2020Saurichthys dawaziensis \u2020Saurichthys grignae \u2020S. minuta \u2020S. longimedialis \u2020S. longipectoralis \u2020C. costasquamosus \u2020C. paucitrichius \u2020Saurichthys macrocephalus \u2020Saurichthys curionii \u2020S. brevirostris \u2020S. calcaratus \u2020S. deperditus \u2020S. striolatus   This article about a Triassic fish is a stub.
