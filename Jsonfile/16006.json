{"Content: ":"The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine led to widespread international condemnation by political parties and international organisations, as well as by people and groups in the areas of entertainment, media, business, and sport, where boycotts of Russia and Belarus also took place.[1] The landmarks lit up in Ukrainian colors included: The Empire State Building, the New York State Assembly, the Pennsylvania State Capitol, the Missouri State Capitol, the Niagara Falls, CN Tower, 3D Toronto sign, downtown Dallas skyline including Reunion Tower and Omni Dallas Hotel, Calgary Tower, the Memorial Bridge, the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, the Acosta Bridge, the Zakim Bridge, the Terminal Tower, the Obelisco de Buenos Aires, the London Eye, the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, Brandenburg Gate, the Fisherman's Bastion, the Palazzo Marino, Cybele Palace, Nelson's Column, the Ludwigsburg Palace, the Øresund Bridge, the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower, St Andrew's House, Wembley stadium, the Crown Buildings, the Senedd building, the SIS Building, 10 Downing Street, St George's Hall, the Royal National Theatre, Ely Cathedral, Blackpool Tower, Somerset House, the Oxo Tower, Bratislava Castle, Grassalkovich Palace, Petřín Lookout Tower, Sarajevo City Hall, the Mole Antonelliana, the Belém Palace, Stenbock House, Palace of Culture and Science, Cotroceni Palace, Vukovar water tower, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, Sebitseom, the N Seoul Tower, Taipei 101, Kaohsiung Music Center, numerous landmarks in Melbourne including Flinders Train Station, the Sydney Opera House, as well as ministries of foreign affairs in Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, and the United Kingdom.[315][316][317][318] Following the invasion, multiple sports events were moved out of Russia and Belarus, suspended, or cancelled. UEFA, the European association football governing body, announced that the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final would be moved from Saint Petersburg to Paris.[404] The Russian Grand Prix for the 2022 Formula One Championship was suspended[405] and it was cancelled on 1 March.[406] The International Federation of Sport Climbing announced the suspension of the Boulder and Speed World Cup in Moscow, 1\u20133 April, with intent to relocate and reschedule the event.[407] The International Ski Federation announced that all remaining events in Russia were cancelled.[408] The World Curling Federation announced that the 2022 European Curling Championship, scheduled for 19\u201326 November, will no longer be held in Perm.[409] The ATP chose to move the St. Petersburg Open tournament.[410] On 27 February 2022, FINA announced that they withdrew Russia's hosting rights for the 2022 World Junior Swimming Championships.[411] On 1 March 2022, the International Volleyball Federation withdrew Russia's hosting rights of the 2022 Men's World Championship scheduled for August and September.[412] The invasion affected Ukraine's participation at the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing, China, with International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons describing transporting the Ukrainian team to Beijing as being an enormous challenge.[413][414] On 2 March 2022, Parsons confirmed the team should be able to compete at the Games.[415] The International Olympic Committee (IOC) condemned Russia's \"breach of the Olympic Truce adopted by the UN General Assembly\". Although the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing concluded four days prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the truce by its terms was set to last until seven days after the 2022 Winter Paralympics concluded in mid-March. IOC President Thomas Bach called for peace. The IOC stated they are greatly concerned about the Olympic community in Ukraine.[495] The IOC Executive Board initially proposed to sanction Russia and Belarus by stripping both countries' rights to host sporting events, and banning the use of their national flags and anthems.[496] The IOC later called on individual federations to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in any international events until further notice.[497] The IOC also withdrew the Olympic Order from Vladimir Putin.[498] On 2 March, the International Paralympic Committee initially said that Russian and Belarusian athletes would be allowed to participate under a neutral flag, with their results not counting in the medal standings.[499][500] As a result of criticism by several National Paralympic Committees, who threatened to boycott the games, the IPC announced on 3 March that they were altering their earlier decision, and banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the 2022 Winter Paralympics.[501][502] In response to Putin's \"denazification\" as his justification of his military campaign, organizations and museums dedicated to the Holocaust memorial such as Yad Vashem,[564] the Auschwitz Museum in Poland and the US Holocaust Museum condemned the invasion and the remark as exploitation of history.[565][566] However, the criticisms of exploitation of the Holocaust history were not against Russia alone. President Zelenskyy's attempt to compare the potential war crimes committed by Russia such as the Bucha massacre with the Holocaust was denounced by the chair of Yad Vashem and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett while demonstrating their sympathy towards Ukraine.[567] One of the chief rabbis in Kyiv, Moshe Reuven Azman, released a video on Telegram on 2 March 2022 in which he accused Putin of committing war crimes and denied Putin's claim that Ukraine was run by Nazism, reinforced by the fact that there were not a single nationalist party in Ukrainian Parliament by the time of the invasion. He pleaded people in Russia to rise and protest Kremlin for the invasion.[568][569] As a consequence of the Russian invasion, polls have shown a very large shift in from the public towards support for both Finland and Sweden to join NATO.[570] The poll, conducted by NPR/Ipsos between 18 and 21 March 2022, found that only 36% of Americans approved the Biden administration's response to the invasion.[571] A Pew Research Center poll found that 72% of Americans had confidence in Zelenskyy's handling of international affairs.[572] In China,[573][574] India,[575][576] Indonesia,[577] Malaysia,[578] Africa,[579] Latin America,[580] and the Arab regions, many social media users showed sympathy for Russian narratives due in part to distrust of US foreign policy.[581] According to a report published by the US-China Perception Monitor, 75% of Chinese respondents said they agreed or strongly agreed that supporting Russia in the conflict was in China's national interest.[582] A study performed by Airlangga University revealed that 71% of Indonesian netizens supported the invasion.[583] This support was due to affection for Putin's strongman leadership, as well as anti-US and anti-Western political alignments.[584] As of 18:40, 2 May 2022 (UTC), this article is derived in whole or in part from Taiwan News.
