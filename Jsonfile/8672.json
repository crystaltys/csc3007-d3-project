Anthony Turgis, who had attacked in the final kilometre to try to bridge the gap to Mohorič, stayed ahead of the chasing group to finish second, with Mathieu van der Poel winning the sprint for third from the aforementioned group.[5][6] All eighteen UCI WorldTeams and the top two UCI ProTeams from the 2021 season, Alpecin\u2013Fenix and Arkéa\u2013Samsic, were automatically invited.[7][8] The next best ProTeam from the 2021 season, Team TotalEnergies also received an automatic invitation, while four additional UCI ProTeams received wild card invitations.[9] Among these teams was Gazprom\u2013RusVelo, but on 1 March 2022, the UCI revoked the licences of Russian and Belarusian teams due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[10] Twenty-four teams participated in the race.[11] Of these teams, Bora\u2013Hansgrohe and Lotto\u2013Soudal, with six riders each, were the only teams to not enter a full squad of seven riders.[12] Team BikeExchange\u2013Jayco was reduced to six riders with one non-starter.
