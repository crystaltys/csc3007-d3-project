Komen for the Cure, supervising all aspects of initial growth. On December 2, 2009, Brinker was appointed CEO.[1] In late January 2012, a public turmoil arose around the Foundation's policy decision to stop funding most Planned Parenthood offices, resulting in an apology from Brinker and a revised policy by the first week of February 2012.[8] On June 17, 2013, Judith A. Salerno replaced Brinker as CEO.[9] Brinker is currently serving as the World Health Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for Cancer Control.

First Lady Laura Bush joined the participants and the White House was illuminated in pink for the occasion.[12] As Chief of Protocol, Brinker expanded the role of the office through outreach programs intended to foster better relationships with the Diplomatic Corps. The effort, known as Diplomatic Partnerships[13] involved over 60 events, including \"Experience America\", where the Diplomatic Corps traveled throughout the United States to meet with business and civic leaders.[14][15] Brinker served as United States Ambassador to Hungary from September 2001 to 2003.[16] For the first time, she held a conference on the trafficking and exploitation of workers that health ministers from the neighboring Balkan States attended. She also raised awareness about breast cancer among Hungarian women by leading a march over the Chain Bridge in Budapest. The bridge was illuminated in pink for the occasion.[17] While ambassador, Brinker began to collect Hungarian art. Her collection spans 100 years, from just before the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the present and has been on display at several museums around the United States. The collection is one of the largest outside of Hungary.[18][19][20][21] Hungarian President Ferenc Mádl decorated Brinker with the Order of Merit, Medium Class, Cross Adorned with Star, for her work in advancing bilateral relations and in recognition of her charity activities.[22][23] The Promise Fund of Florida[24] was created by Ambassador Nancy G.
