{"Content: ":"Damn (stylized as DAMN.) is the fourth studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on April 14, 2017, through Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Lamar assembled numerous artists and producers to produce the album, including executive producer and Top Dawg Entertainment label-head Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, Sounwave, DJ Dahi, Mike Will Made It, and Ricci Riera, as well as further production contributions from James Blake, Steve Lacy, BadBadNotGood, Greg Kurstin, The Alchemist, and 9th Wonder, among others. The album features guest vocals from singers Rihanna and Top Dawg singer Zacari, along with Irish rock band U2. The album has been categorized as conscious hip hop, a genre Lamar incorporated on his previous studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly. The album also incorporates elements of trap, contemporary R&B, and pop. Prior to the album's release, Lamar released a promotional single, \"The Heart Part 4\". In the months that followed, Lamar released three singles from the album; \"Humble\" was released in March 2017, \"Loyalty\" in June 2017, and \"Love\" in October 2017, the first of which became Lamar's first number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 as a lead artist. Damn received widespread critical acclaim, with many naming the album one of the best albums of 2017 and the decade. The album became the first non-jazz or classical work to earn a Pulitzer Prize for Music and won Best Rap Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards, as well receiving a nomination for Album of the Year at the ceremony. The album topped the US Billboard 200 with 603,000 album-equivalent units earned in its first week and topped the chart of Canada while reaching number two in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in May 2018 and was the Billboard Year-End number one album of 2017. In 2020, the album was ranked 175th on Rolling Stone's updated list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The beat for \"Humble\" was developed by Mike Will with the intention of recording with Gucci Mane, but later showed it to Kendrick Lamar. After recording, it was initially agreed upon that it would be released on Mike Will's debut album Ransom 2, but others convinced Lamar to keep it for his own next album.[1] \"DNA\" was the second song from the album to be recorded by Lamar and Mike Will, after \"Humble\". After the first verse of \"DNA\" was recorded with the beat that Mike Will had already prepared, Lamar started rapping the second verse a cappella, requesting that Mike Will build the beat around the rap. Lamar proposed that it sound like \"chaos\", and Mike Will put together the second half of the song with the intention to make it \"sound like he's battling the beat\".[1] Lamar has said in interviews that the ability to play the album in reverse tracklist order was \"premeditated ... in the studio\": \"It plays as a full story and even a better rhythm. It's one of my favorite rhythms and tempos within the album\".[2] Damn has been characterized as conscious rap[3] with elements of trap,[4][5][6] R&B[6][7] and pop.[6] On April 11, 2017, Lamar revealed the cover artwork for Damn.[8][9] The album cover was designed by Vlad Sepetov, who created the album covers for Lamar's last two projects \u2013 To Pimp a Butterfly and Untitled Unmastered. Sepetov described Damn's cover as \"loud and abrasive\" and \"not uber political like To Pimp a Butterfly but it has energy\".[10] Sepetov goes on to say the decision to put the Parental Advisory sticker in its unconventional position was so it could be a part of the design instead of an \"afterthought\".[10] Billboard listed the cover as one of the best of 2017, dubbing it \"both meme-able and memorable\".[11] In a radio interview on June 29, 2017, Lamar revealed the original title for the album was going to be What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth, but eventually settled on Damn. He stated the working title \"didn't read right\".[12] Lamar went on to say about its final title, \"There was so many different ways you could put it in my head. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. The loudness of the record. When I think about \"DNA\", when I think of \"Humble\", when I think these records, it just felt like that.\"[12] On March 23, 2017, Lamar released a promotional single, \"The Heart Part 4\", which contained lyrics hinting at a possible April 7 release date for his fourth studio album.[13] On April 7, 2017, the album was made available for pre-order and confirmed to be released on April 14.[14][15] On April 11, Lamar revealed the track listing for Damn.[8][9] On December 8, 2017, Lamar released the Collectors Edition of the album.

Weingarten, an author for Rolling Stone, said, \"Much like the recent A Tribe Called Quest record, Damn. is a brilliant combination of the timeless and the modern, the old school and the next-level. The most gifted rapper of a generation stomps into the Nineties and continues to blaze a trail forward\".[39] In his review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune states, \"Damn. strips down the rhythms to their essence, flavored with the occasional cameo (notably Rihanna and U2). Lamar's voice does most of the heavy lifting, playing multiple roles and characters. His supple singing complements a variety of rap tones and textures\".[33] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave a positive review, stating \"Tart and punchy. ... Sometimes boisterous, sometimes swampy, rarely fanciful album\u2014it's Mr. Lamar's version of the creeping paranoia that has become de rigueur for midcareer Drake. And yet this is likely Mr. Lamar's most jubilant album, the one in which his rhymes are the least tangled\".[41] Eric Renner Brown of Entertainment Weekly said, \"After delving into the personal on 2012's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and going broader on Butterfly, Lamar has found a middle ground on Damn. that yields some of his most emotionally resonant music yet\".[35] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote: \"If it seems a more straightforward listen than To Pimp a Butterfly, there's a cheering sense that this doesn't equate to a lessening of musical ambition. There's none of that album's wilfully jarring quality \u2013 its sudden, anxious musical lurches and abrupt, short-circuiting leaps between genres \u2013 but the tracks on Damn still feel episodic and expansive. Whether Damn will have the same epochal impact as To Pimp a Butterfly remains to be seen, but either way it sounds like the work of a supremely confident artist at the top of his game.\"[36] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stating that Damn \"is the work of a future all-time great in full command of his powers\".[34] Leonie Cooper of NME said, \"Damn. is by far his shortest release to date \u2013 but the ideas, thoughts and feelings it contains are massive, weighty things, from sexual tension to deep, dark depression\".[37] In Pitchfork's review of Damn, Matthew Trammell writes Damn \"is a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick's destiny in America\".[38] Writing for The A.V. Club, Evan Rytlewski concluded, \"Lamar trusts every idea to stand on its own. When you're making art this substantial, vital, and virtuosic, there's no need to wrap a tidy bow around it\".[32] In a mixed review, A. Harmony of Exclaim! wrote that Damn \"is the first time in Lamar's career that he hasn't broken new ground, explored old themes in new ways or exhibited sonic growth\".[42] In the United States, Damn debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 603,000 album-equivalent units in its first week of release, becoming his third consecutive album after To Pimp a Butterfly (2015) and Untitled Unmastered (2016) to reach the nation's summit.
