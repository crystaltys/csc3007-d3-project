{"Content: ":"Barry Whitley Sinclair MNZM (23 October 1936 \u2013 10 July 2022) was a New Zealand cricketer. He played 21 Test matches for New Zealand national team as a specialist batsman from 1962\u201363 to 1967\u201368, and captained the team from 1966 to 1968. Sinclair was born in Wellington on 23 October 1936.[1] He attended Rongotai College in his hometown.[2] He was first selected to play for Wellington when he was eighteen.[3] Sinclair played for Wellington from 1955\u201356 to 1970\u201371.[2] His first century came against Northern Districts in 1963\u201364, when he made 102 not out, out of a team total of 138 for 5, to take Wellington to a five-wicket victory almost single-handedly.[4] His highest first-class score was 148, captaining Wellington against the Australians in 1966\u201367, out of a total of 365 for 7 on the first day.[5] Sinclair scored three of his six first-class centuries in Tests, though never played in a winning Test side. He captained New Zealand in three Tests (the Second and Third Tests against England in 1965\u201366, and the First Test against India in 1967\u201368) and also in the four-match series against the visiting Australian team in 1966\u201367 and on the brief tour to Australia in 1967\u201368. He retired from international cricket in 1968 to concentrate on work.[2] Sinclair's highest Test score was 138 against South Africa in Auckland in 1963\u201364, made in 345 minutes out of a team total of only 263.[6] It was the only century by either side in the three-Test series; at the time, it was the highest Test score ever attained by a New Zealander in New Zealand.[7] He took two Test wickets in ten overs, both against Pakistan in Lahore in 1964\u201365, after scoring 130 in the first innings.[8] Sinclair's short stature was sometimes exploited by pace bowlers. However, he learned how to handle short-pitched deliveries. He was a neat, tidy batsman notable for his cutting and on-drives.[2] Christopher Martin-Jenkins described him thus: \"Fair-haired and one of the smallest cricketers ever to appear [for] New Zealand, Barry Sinclair was a sound and often fluent right-handed batsman with an indomitable spirit and an excellent field at cover.\"[9] Sinclair was made the inaugural patron of the New Zealand Cricket Players\u2019 Association in 2010.[10] Five years later, he was voted a Legend of Wellington Sport.[2] In the 2016 Queen's Birthday Honours, Sinclair was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to cricket.[11] Sinclair died on 10 July 2022 aged 85.[1][3]","Title":"Barry Sinclair - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17563","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sinclair"}
