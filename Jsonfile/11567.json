{"Content: ":"See text Coccolepidae Berg, 1940 Coccolepididae is an extinct family of ray-finned fish, known from the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, most of which were originally referred to the type genus Coccolepis. They had a widespread distribution, being found in North and South America, Australia, Asia and Europe. They are mostly known from freshwater environments, though several were marine. They are morphologically conservative, and have poorly ossified endo and exoskeletons, which usually results in poor preservation. This makes it difficult to distinguish species.[1] They are generally small fish, with the largest known specimens reaching a length of 210 mm.[2] Historically, they have been classified as members of \u201cPalaeonisciformes\u201d, a paraphyletic grouping of all non-neopterygian fish, due to their plesiomorphic conservative morphology closely resembling those of many other groups of primitive fish.[3] They have been suggested to be relatives of the Acipenseriformes within the Chondrostei.[1][2] After[1][2] ","Title":"Coccolepididae - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11567","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolepididae"}
