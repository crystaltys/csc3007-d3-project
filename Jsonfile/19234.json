{"Content: ":"Charles X Gustav of Sweden The Battle of Warsaw (German: Schlacht von Warschau; Polish: Bitwa pod Warszawą; Swedish: Tredagarsslaget vid Warschau) took place near Warsaw on July 28\u2013July 30 [O.S. July 18\u201320] 1656, between the armies of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden and Brandenburg. It was a major battle in the Second Northern War between Poland and Sweden in the period 1655\u20131660, also known as The Deluge. According to Hajo Holborn, it marked \"the beginning of Prussian military history\".[7] In the battle, a smaller Swedish-Brandenburg force, but with the fire superiority of infantry and artillery gained victory over a Polish\u2013Lithuanian force superior in numbers, though in the long term the victory achieved little. Polish\u2013Lithuanian losses were insignificant, since the Polish noble levy promptly and unbroken retreated from the battlefield. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian forces, commanded by King John II Casimir of Poland, comprised about 24\u201325,000 regulars, which included only 950 Winged Hussars (8 banners), 2,000 Tatars and 10\u201313,000 of the noble levy (pospolite ruszenie), altogether some 40,000 men of which only about 4,500 were infantry.[1]:\u200a173\u200a The allied armies of Sweden and Brandenburg, commanded by King Charles X of Sweden and Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg, were only 18,000 strong, comprising 12,500 cavalry (60 squadrons), and 5,500 infantry (15 brigades), which included 8,500 Brandenburg men.[1]:\u200a174\u200a Second in command of Brandenburg's forces was Otto Christoph von Sparr. John II Casimir ferried his army across the Vistula River[1]:\u200a173\u200a and met the approaching Swedish-Brandenburg force on its right bank, about five kilometers to the north of the suburb of Praga. Charles X had initially hoped to destroy the Lithuanian and Tatar forces before they joined up with the remainder of the Commonwealth army, but this plan failed. Some officers of Brandenburg considered the Polish\u2013Lithuanian forces to be overwhelming in numbers and instead advocated a retreat. Charles marched his allied army down the right (east) bank of the Vistula on 28 July and assaulted the Polish army.[1]:\u200a174\u200a However, the Polish infantry had dug into a narrow corridor along the river bank, which prevented them from being dislodged.[1]:\u200a174\u200a Charles, wheeling left, moved his entire army to the Polish right, through the Białołęka Forest onto a narrow plain, consolidating his position before the Polish hussars could react.[1]:\u200a174\u200a Aleksander Polbinski's 800 hussars drove into the three lines of cavalry, reiter, guarding the flanks of Charles' infantry.[1]:\u200a174\u200a The hussars broke through the first line of Uppland and Småland regiments, but deprived of support, they were stopped by the flank fire of the Swedish regiments.[1]:\u200a174\u200a As a result of the attack, Charles Gustav was in danger and wounded.[8] The kozacka cavalry, the pancerna, did not participate in the attack, being held in reserve.[1]:\u200a174\u200a Seeing that the Swede-Brandenburg allies held their ground, John II Casimir withdrew his army across the Vistula bridge, covered by his cavalry.[1]:\u200a174\u200a The Swede and Brandenburg allies occupied the open plain and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian cavalry escaped along the Vistula and John Casimir abandoned Warsaw again.[1]:\u200a174\u200a The Brandenburg and Swedish allies occupied Radom on 10 Aug., and the Brandenburg garrisons replaced the Swedes in Wielkopolska, but then they refused to support the Swedes any further, forcing Charles to withdraw north to Royal Prussia.[1]:\u200a174\u200a John Casimir quickly regrouped at Lublin.[1]:\u200a177\u200a The Battle of Warsaw is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"Warszawa 30 V-1 VII, 28\u201330 VII 1656\".
