{"Content: ":"The Cullen\u2013Harrison Act, named for its sponsors, Senator Pat Harrison and Representative Thomas H. Cullen, enacted by the United States Congress on March 21, 1933, and signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt the following day, legalized the sale in the United States of beer with an alcohol content of 3.2% (by weight) and wine of similarly low alcohol content, thought to be too low to be intoxicating, effective April 7, 1933. Upon signing the legislation, Roosevelt made his famous remark, \"I think this would be a good time for a beer.\"[1][2] According to the Cullen\u2013Harrison Act, states had to pass their own similar legislation to legalize sale of the low alcohol beverages within their borders. Roosevelt had previously sent a short message to Congress requesting such a bill. Sale of even low alcohol beer had been illegal in the U.S. since Prohibition started in 1920 following the 1919 passage of the Volstead Act.[3] Throngs gathered outside breweries and taverns to celebrate the return of 3.2 beer.[4] The passage of the Cullen\u2013Harrison Act is celebrated as National Beer Day every year on April 7 in the United States.
