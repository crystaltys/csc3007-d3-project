{"Content: ":"Vladimir Putin's meeting table is a white-topped oval beech table that was installed in the Kremlin in the late 1990s, during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin.[1] It is reported that the table is 6 metres (20 feet) long, made from a single sheet of beech wood, and supported on three hollowed wooden stands. It is lacquered white and is gold-plated on the side.[2] OAK Furniture, a business from Cantù, Italy, has claimed to have made the table, as part of a deal furnishing parts of the Kremlin between 1995 and 1997. OAK has produced a picture of the table in a book published in 1999.[2] However, a Spanish retired cabinet maker says he made the table in c. 2005.[2] In 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the table in meetings with world leaders, among others Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and António Guterres.[3][4][5] Putin was pictured seated at one end of a very long white meeting table, with the other participants seated far away from him at the other end. Putin has also been pictured attending similarly distanced meetings with his own officials at other long tables.[6] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the table became a subject of numerous internet memes.[7] It has been speculated that Putin chooses to use the long table in an attempt to intimidate and to project an image of power, or for fear of contracting COVID-19.[3][8][9] Putin has been pictured attending meetings in close proximity with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping in the same period.[10] Media related to Vladimir Putin's meeting table at Wikimedia Commons This Russia-related article is a stub.
