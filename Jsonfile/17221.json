{"Content: ":"Guy is a 2018 French comedy film directed, written and starring Alex Lutz. This is a mockumentary of a 73-year-old French pop singer, \"Guy Jamet\" (Alex Lutz), whose heyday was three or more decades ago, touring to promote a new album of covers. Pretending to film a documentary about him is Gauthier (Tom Dingler), who suspects Guy may be his biological father based on a letter written by his recently deceased mother that he (Gauthier) discovered. Guy is a \"compilation of a number of classic\" French crooners, and the film is made up of interviews by Gauthier of Guy with references to French TV shows and personalities. These are interrupted by performances of Guy's soft, sentimental pop songs before enthusiastic audiences during his tour.[3] The Hollywood Reporter considered Guy to be \"A sparkling, ironic salute to age and passing time\".[3]  This article related to a French film of the 2010s is a stub.
