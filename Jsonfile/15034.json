Parliament is elected by universal vote, equal directly, secret and freely expressed. The President of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova is elected by the Parliament, with a minimum of 52 votes. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova, on a proposal of the Central Electoral Commission, decides to validate or invalidate the mandate of the Member of Parliament. The mandate is invalid in the case of violation of electoral legislation. The Parliament is meeting at the convening of the Speaker of the Parliament within 30 days of the elections. Parliament's mandate is prolonged until the legal meeting of the new composition. During this period the Constitution cannot be amended and organic laws cannot be adopted, amended or abrogated.[1] Parliamentary elections took place on 11 July 2021.[2] The snap parliamentary elections resulted in a landslide win for Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS).[3] The Parliament staff ensures an organizational, informational and technological assistance to activity of the Parliament, the Standing Bureau, standing committees, parliamentary factions and of deputies. The structure and the personal record of the parliament staff are approved by the Parliament. According to the Constitution of Moldova (1994), the Parliament is the supreme representative organ and the single legislative authority of the state. The right of legislative initiative belongs to the Members of Parliament, to the Speaker (excepting proposals to revise the Constitution) and to the Government. In exercise of this right MPs and the President of the state present to Parliament draft papers and legislative proposals, while the Government presents draft papers. In order to form the working bodies and to organize the activity of the parliament, deputies form parliamentary factions composed of at least 5 deputies elected on the basis of lists of electoral contestants, as well as parliamentary factions with the same numerical composition as independent deputies. The parliamentary factions are constituted within 10 days after the legal constitution of the parliament. The 101 deputies elected on 11 July 2021 at the 2021 Moldovan parliamentary election constitute 3 main parliamentary factions as follows:[4] Permanent Bureau The Parliament Building was formerly the meeting place of the Central Committee of the Moldovan branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and was built between 1976 and 1979.
