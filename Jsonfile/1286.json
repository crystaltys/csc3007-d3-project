{"Content: ":"see text The sweat bee genus Lasioglossum is the largest of all bee genera, containing over 1700 species in numerous subgenera worldwide.[1][2] They are highly variable in size, coloration, and sculpture; among the more unusual variants, some are cleptoparasites, some are nocturnal, and some are oligolectic. Most Lasioglossum species nest in the ground, but some nest in rotten logs.[citation needed] Social behavior among species of Lasioglossum is extraordinarily variable; species are known to exhibit solitary nesting, primitive eusociality, and social parasitism. Colony sizes vary widely, from small colonies of a single queen four or fewer workers to large colonies of >400 workers and perennial life cycles.[3] The genus Lasioglossum can be divided into two informal series based on the strength of the distal veins of the forewing.[4] The Lasioglossum series (or strong-veined Lasioglossum) is mostly composed of solitary or communal species, even if some species like L. aegyptiellum show signs of division of labour indicative of eusociality.[1] The Hemihalictus series (or weak-veined Lasioglossum) includes species with a wide range of sociality.[5][3] The Hemihalictus series is composed of species which are solitary, communal, primitively eusocial, cleptoparasitic, or socially parasitic.[citation needed] Eusocial species may have small colonies with only one or a few workers or large colonies with dozens of workers. Large colony sizes occur in L. marginatum, which forms perennial colonies lasting five or six years, with hundreds of workers; this species is the only halictine bee with perennial colonies.[3] A list of subgenera (modified from Michener's Bees of the World): Lasioglossum series: Australictus, Callalictus, Chilalictus, Ctenonomia, Echthralictus, Glossalictus, Lasioglossum s. str., Leuchalictus, Oxyhalictus, Parasphecodes, Pseudochilalictus, Rubrihalictus, Urohalictus. Hemihalictus series: Acanthalictus, Austrevylaeus, Dialictus, Evylaeus, Hemihalictus, Homalictus, Paradialictus, Sellalictus, Sphecodogastra, Sudila. Subgeneric classification of Lasioglossum remains controversial, with disagreement among experts on the number and extent of subgenera. Two of the better-known species are the European Lasioglossum malachurum and the North American species Lasioglossum zephyrus.","Title":"Lasioglossum - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1286","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasioglossum"}
