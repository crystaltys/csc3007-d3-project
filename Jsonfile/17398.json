{"Content: ":"Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈɡɾemju futʃiˈbɔw ˌpoɾtw ɐleˈɡɾẽsi]), commonly known as Grêmio, is a Brazilian professional football club based in Porto Alegre, capital city of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. The club plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, the second division of the Brazilian football league system, and the Campeonato Gaúcho, Rio Grande do Sul's top state league. The club was founded in 1903 by European immigrants Englishman Andy Fairbank and German Paul Cochlin. The club's home ground is the Arena do Grêmio, to which it moved in 2013, having previously played at Estádio Olímpico Monumental since 1954. Grêmio also became Champions of the Intercontinental Cup, after beating Hamburger SV in 1983 (2\u20131).[2][3][4] Also, Grêmio is the Brazilian club that has won the most Copa CONMEBOL Libertadores de América (3) titles alongside São Paulo FC, Santos, and Palmeiras.[5] As of 2017, Grêmio was ranked number one in the CBF club rankings[6] and is listed by Forbes as the third most valuable football club in the Americas with an estimated value of $295.5 million.[7] Grêmio has won 41 Campeonato Gaúcho, 2 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, 1 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, 1 Supercopa do Brasil, 1 Copa Sul and 5 Copa do Brasil. Internationally, Grêmio has won 1 Intercontinental Cup, 3 Copa Libertadores de América, 2 Recopa Sudamericana and 1 Sanwa Bank Cup.[8] Grêmio usually plays in a tricolor (blue, black and white) striped shirt, black shorts and white socks, which originated the team's nickname. Grêmio has a fierce rivalry with Internacional, which is widely considered the most heated in Brazil[9][10] and one of the most heated in the world.[11][12] Matches between the two teams are known as Grenal. On 7 September 1903, Brazil's first football team, Rio Grande, played an exhibition match in Porto Alegre. An entrepreneur from Sorocaba, São Paulo, named Cândido Dias was besotted with the sport and went to watch the match. During the match, the ball deflated. As the only owner of a football in Porto Alegre, he lent his ball to the players and the match resumed. After the match, he talked to the local players about how to start a football club. On 15 September 1903, 32 people, including Cândido Dias, met at Salão Grau, a local restaurant and founded \"Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense\". Most of the founding members were part of the city's German community.[13] Carlos Luiz Bohrer was elected as first president.[14] The club's first match took place on 6 March 1904, against Fuss Ball Porto Alegre, the first of two matches played that day. Grêmio won the first match 1\u20130. Unfortunately, the name of the player who scored the club's first goal is lost to history. The trophy Grêmio won that day, the Wanderpreis, is still displayed at the club's museum. Within 5 months the club had inaugurated the Baixada, its first home. On 18 July 1909, Grêmio beat Internacional 10\u20130 on the latter's debut game. Grêmio's goalkeeper Kallfelz reportedly left the field to chat with fans during the match. Even now this victory is remembered with pride by Gremistas (Grêmio supporters). The match was the starting point for a rivalry that rages on to this day. Grêmio was one of the founding members of the Porto Alegre football league in 1910, and in 1911 won the league for the first time. On 25 August 1912, in a city league match, Grêmio beat Sport Clube Nacional of Porto Alegre 23\u20130. Sisson scored 14 goals in the match to record Grêmio's biggest ever win. In 1918, Grêmio became a founding member of the Fundação Rio-Grandense de Desportes (later known as Federação Gaúcha de Futebol), a federation that organized the first state championships in Rio Grande do Sul. The first championship was scheduled for 1918, but the Spanish flu epidemic forced the event to be postponed until 1919. In 1921, a year after the arrival of legendary goalkeeper Eurico Lara, Grêmio won its first state championship. On 7 July 1911, Grêmio beat Uruguay's national team 2\u20131. In 1931, Grêmio became one of the first teams in Brazil to play matches at night after installing floodlights at Estádio Baixada. On 19 May 1935, Grêmio became the first team from Rio Grande do Sul to beat a team from the state of São Paulo (considered the strongest Brazilian league at the time) by defeating Santos 3\u20132. Grêmio was also the first club outside Rio de Janeiro state to play at the Maracanã Stadium, defeating Flamengo 3\u20131 in 1950. During this period, Grêmio started to earn a reputation abroad. In 1932 it played its first international match in Rivera (Uruguay). In 1949, the match against Uruguay's Nacional ended in a 3\u20131 win for Grêmio and the players received a hero's welcome on their return to Porto Alegre. In that same year, Grêmio played for the first time in Central America. Between 1953 and 1954, Grêmio travelled to Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia, a tour dubbed \"the conquest of the Americas\". On 25 February 1959, Grêmio defeated Boca Juniors 4\u20131 in Buenos Aires, becoming the first foreign team to beat Boca at La Bombonera. In 1961, Grêmio went on its first European tour playing 24 games in 11 countries: France, Romania, Belgium, Greece, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Denmark, Estonia and Russia. The Gremistas (Grêmio fans) were growing in number. 1946 saw the first appearance of the club's motto \"com o Grêmio onde o Grêmio estiver\" (\"with Grêmio wherever Grêmio may be\"), which was later written into Grêmio's official anthem. An anthem penned by Lupicinio Rodrigues, a samba-cancao composer who became one of the most famous and revered Grêmio fans. The anthem celebrates the Gremistas reputation for attending all Grêmio matches, regardless of the difficulties and obstacles they might have to overcome to see their club. In the late 1950s, Grêmio joined the Taça Brasil, as the Brazilian league was known at the time. The team reached the Taça Brasil semi-finals in 1959, 1963 and 1967. In 1968, the team won its first international title in a friendly cup with teams from Brazil and Uruguay. In 1954, Grêmio inaugurated what was at the time the biggest private stadium in Brazil, the Olímpico Stadium. In 1971, the Taça Brasil championship was replaced by the Campeonato Brasileiro with the first goal ever scored in the Campeonato Brasileiro coming from Grêmio's Néstor Scotta, an Argentine, in a match against São Paulo at Estádio do Morumbi.[15] Grêmio maintained a series of respectable results in Campeonato Brasileiro, usually achieving a top half finish. Grêmio's first dominant period in South American football began in the early 1980s. Propelled by the completion of their new stadium, the Olímpico Monumental. Grêmio won its first Campeonato Brasileiro on 3 May 1981, after defeating São Paulo at the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo. The scores in the two-leg final were 2\u20131 at Olímpico and 1\u20130 for Grêmio at Morumbi. The winning goal was scored by striker Baltazar. Earlier, on 26 April 1981 Olímpico had its biggest attendance ever, when 98,421 fans watched Grêmio lose to Ponte Preta 0\u20131 in the Campeonato Brasileiro semi-final. 1983 was the most successful year in Grêmio's history. First, Grêmio won the South-American Copa Libertadores, after a consistent yet eventful campaign. One of the matches of the semi-final, the 3\u20133 draw against Estudiantes at Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium, became legendary for its belligerence on and off the pitch and is dubbed the \"Batalha de La Plata\" (\"Battle of La Plata\").[16][17] In the finals, Grêmio beat the 1982 South America and World champions Peñarol from Uruguay, with a 1\u20131 draw in Montevideo and a 2\u20131 win in Porto Alegre. The winning goal was scored by César just before the end of the match. A year later, Grêmio was runner-up in the Copa Libertadores final, being defeated by Argentina's Independiente. Also in 1983, Grêmio won the Intercontinental Cup after defeating Hamburger SV of Germany 2\u20131.[18] Renato Portaluppi scored both goals. With Uruguayan defender De León and goalkeeper Mazaropi also earning club legend status on the back of their performances in the Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup. Porto Alegre, was deafened by the gremista's chant of: \"The Earth is Blue\". Soon after winning the Intercontinental Cup, Grêmio beat America of Mexico in Los Angeles, and won the Los Angeles Cup. In 1989, Grêmio won the first Copa do Brasil, a Brazilian knockout cup featuring football teams from all around the country. After humiliating Flamengo with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg of the semi-finals, Grêmio defeated Sport Recife in the final, with a 0\u20130 draw in Recife and a 2\u20131 win in Porto Alegre. In 1991, after a poor season, Grêmio was relegated for the first time to the Brazilian Second Division[19] but gained immediate promotion back to the Campeonato Brasileiro's elite the following season (1993). After this return to form, 1994 saw Grêmio win its second Copa do Brasil, defeating Ceará in the two-leg final (0\u20130 and 1\u20130), the solitary goal scored by striker Nildo. This win kickstarted the club's Tokyo Project. On December 11, 1994, Grêmio had to play three matches in a single day during the 1994 Campeonato Gaúcho, with kick-off times of 2PM, 4PM, and 6PM, due to their extensive schedule. They won two and drew the third match, using a total of 34 different players.[20] In May 1995, under head coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, Grêmio were runners-up in the Copa do Brasil, losing the final match to Corinthians 0\u20131 at Olímpico Monumental. In August, a few days after beating arch-rivals Internacional for the state title with a reserve squad, the club won the Copa Libertadores for the second time. Defeating Atlético Nacional of Colombia 3\u20131 in Porto Alegre and drawing 1\u20131 in Medellín. The tournament was marked by fierce matches against Palmeiras in the quarter-finals. Palmeiras had perhaps the best squad on the competition, with players such as Rivaldo, Cafu, Edmundo, César Sampaio, Antônio Carlos, Roberto Carlos and Mancuso. They were soundly beaten by Grêmio in the 1st leg in an epic 5\u20130 match with a hat-trick from Mário Jardel. Palmeiras beat Grêmio 5\u20131 in the return leg, with Jardel's lone strike proving enough to see Grêmio through to the Semi-finals. This qualified the club to the World Club tournament where Grêmio pushed a talented Ajax (Featuring Patrick Kluivert, Overmars, Van Der Sar and Kanu) into extra time and penalties despite being a player down. Early 1996 saw Grêmio win the Recopa Sudamericana, beating Argentina's Independiente 4\u20131. On 15 December 1996, Grêmio won its second Campeonato Brasileiro, defeating Portuguesa in the final. Portuguesa won the first match at home 2\u20130, and therefore Grêmio was forced to win the final match at Porto Alegre by the same score or more. Grêmio got to 2\u20130, with midfielder Ailton scoring the second goal a few minutes before the final whistle. Grêmio won the title due to their higher finish in the league. In 1997, Grêmio won their third Copa do Brasil title. In the finals against Romário's Flamengo, Grêmio won on away goals after a 0\u20130 draw in Porto Alegre and a 2\u20132 draw in Rio de Janeiro. Four years later, in 2001, Grêmio won their fourth Copa do Brasil, defeating Corinthians. The first leg of the final, in Porto Alegre, finished with the score of 2\u20132. The second game in São Paulo ended with a 3\u20131 Grêmio victory, in a match which is regarded as one of the finest in Grêmio's history. In 2004, after performing poorly for two consecutive seasons in the Série A, Grêmio finished bottom of the league and were relegated to Campeonato Brasileiro's Second Division.[21] Grêmio's promotion battle was difficult, with only two clubs able to qualify for promotion to the First Division. On 26 November 2005, at Estádio dos Aflitos, Recife, Grêmio had four players sent off and two penalty given kicks against them in a tumultuous match that has become known as \"The Battle of the Aflitos\" (\"A Batalha dos Aflitos\", \"Aflitos\" being the name of Náutico's home field). Bruno Carvalho bounced the first penalty bounced off the post in the first half when Grêmio still had 11 players on the field; the second was saved by goalkeeper Galatto when had been reduced to 7 men. Within 72seconds of Galatto saving the penalty 17-year-old Anderson had made a run down the left flank to slot the ball into the back of the net to score Grêmio's winning goal. A goal that sealed the Série B championship and promotion to the Série A. On 9 April 2006, at Estádio Beira-Rio, Grêmio won the state championship against Internacional, preventing them from winning a fifth title in a row. Playing away, Grêmio managed to obtain a 1\u20131 draw in the second leg of the final, enough to secure the title on away goals. Grêmio players said after the match that there were more than 50,000 Internacional fans in Beira Rio's Stadium and they could still hear the noise made by 6,000 Gremistas. In 2007, at Estádio Olímpico Monumental, Grêmio won the Campeonato Gaúcho once again this time against Juventude. Also in 2007, Grêmio reached the final of the 2007 Copa Libertadores. Throughout the campaign the team overcame away losses by putting in heroic home performances and earning the moniker of Imortal Tricolor. This also pumped up the fans who even after a heavy 3\u20130 away defeat to Boca Juniors formed huge lines to buy tickets for the final game in Porto Alegre. with some of the fans queuing for four days or more. Unfortunately fan fervor wasn't enough with Riquelme's magnificent performance handing Boca Juniors a 2\u20130 win and the Copa Libertadores title. In 2008, after the sudden firing of their head coach Vagner Mancini, the club hired Celso Roth. Within a month they had prematurely dropped out of both the domestic cup (Copa do Brasil) and their state championship (Campeonato Gaúcho). This led to the team going through a state of crisis and, soon after, major renovation. They were expected to finish in the bottom half of the Campeonato Brasileiro but managed to finish in second place. For many supporters, even that was considered a failure as in the first half of the championship, the team was in fine form and even considered the best in the country. At the halfway point of the season the team had a 10-point lead over second place that they would eventually surrender in the final games of the season. 2012 marked the last year of the club's former stadium, Olímpico Monumental. Fan expectations were high but were not matched by the team's performance. Grêmio did, however, qualify for the Libertadores the following year. In 2014, the club once again qualified for the Copa Libertadores de América and signed Enderson Moreira as the new manager.[22] However, after a successful campaign in the group stage, Grêmio failed in the competition and were eliminated by San Lorenzo in the Round of 16.[23] A few days before, the club was defeated 6\u20132 on aggregate by their biggest rival, the Internacional, in the finals of the Campeonato Gaúcho.[24] With nothing more than a regular campaign at the beginning of the Série A, club president Fábio Koff signed Luiz Felipe Scolari as the new coach of the team. The club also invested in Giuliano, the biggest hiring of the year.[25] In 2015, former Grêmio player Roger Machado was hired as the new manager. A short lived but initially successful run, Machado's time with Grêmio saw them qualify for the 2016 Copa Libertadores with a finish in the Campeonato Brasileiro in 3rd place. Machado oversaw a famous victory over beat bitter rivals Internacional with a 5\u20130 drubbing in \"Grenal\" No. 407. Nonetheless, towards the end of the year, the team began to show a lack of organization, especially in its defensive system. As fan support dwindled, Roger announced his resignation after a 3\u20130 loss against Ponte Preta in September 2016. Renato Portaluppi replaced him and under his guidance a resurgent Grêmio became champions of the Copa do Brasil against Atlético Mineiro in a 4\u20132 aggregate score, making them the Brazilian club with the most titles in this tournament (5). After this historic feat, fans affectionately nicknamed Grêmio the \"Rei de Copas\" (King of Cups). In 2017, Grêmio won their third Libertadores, after defeating Club Atlético Lanús 1\u20130 at Arena do Grêmio, followed by a 2\u20131 victory in Estadio Ciudad de Lanús. Luan was named the player of the tournament, while goalkeeper Marcelo Grohe performed spectacularly with a heroic, almost impossible save in the semi-final match against Barcelona Sporting Club. They became the third Brazilian club to win a third Copa Libertadores, after São Paulo and Santos. The club went on to represent CONMEBOL at the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup, held in the United Arab Emirates. Grêmio beat Pachuca 1\u20130 in a tight semi-final, the goal coming from Everton in extra-time. They were beaten 0\u20131 by Real Madrid in the final. Grêmio once again finished 4th in the 2018 Campeonato Brasileiro securing a place in the Copa Libertadores de América having been knocked out in the semi-final of the tournament on goal-difference in 2018 by a late River Plate goal to end the match 2\u20132. The goal was scored from a penalty, given on review of a handball by the VAR from Matheus Bressan in the 95th minute.[26] Bressan was subsequently transferred.[27] In the hours following the match it was revealed that River Plate manager Marcelo Gallardo had broken the rules of his touchline ban at half-time by entering the River dressing room. Grêmio appealed the result within 24 hours of the final whistle based on this information. It took CONMEBOL 2 days to deliberate, deciding that the result should stand, with Gallardo receiving a $50,000 fine and a 4-match suspension (1 from the Bombonera Stadium for the first leg of the Libertadores final against Boca Juniors and 3 subsequent touchline bans).[28] River Plate would go on to win the Copa Libertadores de América after further controversy. According to the club, the gold star represents the victory in the World Club Championship; the silver represents the three South American competition victories; and the bronze one represents the National competitions. There is also a gold star in Grêmio's flag that represents a player, Everaldo, the sole Grêmio player in the 1970 Brazilian World Cup winning team. The first club flag was unveiled by the club during the opening ceremony for the Baixada stadium. At that time, it had a horizontal stripe of blue, black and white, with a medallion on the left top corner. The Brazilian Flag was the inspiration for the Tricolor's standard from 1918 to 1944. Grêmio's anthem is one of the most critically acclaimed in all of Brazilian football, other than the anthems of the clubs from Rio de Janeiro (all composed by Lamartine Babo), it is the only football anthem composed by a renowned composer, Lupicínio Rodrigues. Featuring a vivid melody in the style of a march, the anthem features the famous verses: Até a pé nós iremos / para o que der e vier / mas o certo é que nós estaremos / com o Grêmio onde o Grêmio estiver (Even on foot we will go / against all obstacles / but we sure will be / with Grêmio wherever Grêmio may be). Grêmio supporters boast that Grêmio, as the anthem hints, has never played without supporters anywhere in the world. Eurico Lara, a goalkeeper who played for the club in the 1920s and in the 1930s, is mentioned in the anthem, where he is called the immortal idol (or craque imortal, in Portuguese). Grêmio tricolour scheme is made up of blue, black and white, an unusual colour combination for football shirts. The first Grêmio kit was inspired by English club Exeter City. At the time, the original kit included a black cap, striped shirt in blue and havana (a variation of brown), white tie, white shorts and black socks. Subsequently, the uniform was changed to blue and black due to the lack of havana fabric. Soon after, vertical white stripes were included in the kit creating a pattern that is used to the present day. The Grêmio colors are set in the club statute as so; Grêmio kits throughout its history:[29] It was in the early 1980s that Grêmio received its first official sponsor, with the Brazilian Olympikus providing sports equipment. The partnership lasted until early 1983, when, on account of the brilliant moment that had been living in your history, the Grêmio has signed a contract with a German Adidas to supply. However, the partnership was short-lived, as in 1985, with the end of the contract with Adidas,a new supplier emerged, returning to the national level with Penalty. In 1987, for the first time in its history the Grêmio signed a sponsorship agreement for stamping the shirt, with Coca-Cola. This turn in their campaigns unprecedentedly exchanged their traditional red logo for black, because this color belongs to International, its biggest rival, and be vetoed at Grêmio. Sponsorship of Penalty and Coca-Cola persisted with Grêmio for nearly a decade until, in 1995, the soft drink brand left the main sponsor of the shirts, which was assumed by Tintas Renner, until 1997. In 1998, General Motors assumed this position, exposing numerous names of vehicles throughout the partnership. At the beginning of the 21st century, Penalty left the club, with the Italian Kappa providing sports equipment. In 2001, for the payment of debts, Grêmio closed an agreement with the state government of Rio Grande do Sul, exposing Banrisul banking mark on his shirt. However, after payment, it was Banrisul who assumed the payments and became the master sponsor of the club. In 2005 the contract with Kappa came to an end, after this, kits were the responsibility of another German in club history, Puma. Also from this era, Grêmio opened more spaces for smaller sponsors, with the first being Tramontina, Unimed, TIM and the return of Coca-Cola. In 2011, once again changing the supplier of sports equipment occurs, this time taking the Brazilian Topper, under the value of \u20ac4.8 million per season, which operates in the South American market, with a contract until the end of 2014. Beginning in 2015 season, the British company Umbro supplied sports equipment of Grêmio, paying the value of \u20ac6 million per year.[30] Grêmio's original stadium was the Estádio Olímpico Monumental, as it is called today. It was inaugurated on 19 September 1954 as Estádio Olímpico. At the time it was the largest private stadium in Brazil. Estádio Olímpico's first game was between Grêmio and Nacional from Uruguay; Grêmio won by a score of 2\u20130, with both goals scored by Vítor. In 1980 a second tier was added to the Olímpico, and the stadium was renamed the Olímpico Monumental. The first game at the renamed Olímpico Monumental was played on 21 June 1980, when Grêmio beat Vasco da Gama by a score of 1\u20130. Estádio Olímpico Monumental has an attendance record of 98,421 people for the game against Ponte Preta on 26 April 1981. Estádio Olímpico Monumental has 40 luxury booths which hold 10 people, and 5 booths which hold 20 people. It also has 140 places in a Tribune of Honor. It has 28 seats reserved for handicapped fans, 22 of which have space for people accompanying them. The Estádio Olímpico Monumental's Parking lot has space for 700 vehicles. In 2012, Grêmio moved into their new stadium, Arena do Grêmio, a big multi-use stadium in Porto Alegre. Its capacity is 55,225 and is one of the most modern venues in South America. The first location for training used by Grêmio was the additional field built next door of Estádio Olímpico Monumental. However, it can not be exactly characterized as a training centre. In 2000 the construction of the first training centre of the club, the CT Hélio Dourado, in Eldorado do Sul, in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre was completed, but, because of it being located quite far away, it ended up being used for club's Academy. In 2014,the construction of the new training center of Grêmio, the CT Luiz Carvalho, located next to the Arena do Grêmio, in Porto Alegre was finished. It is adjacent to the Guaíba River, and has one of the most beautiful views of the city with the stadium and a cable-stayed bridge in the background. Grêmio has around 8 million fans in the country, meaning that, in terms of ranking, the club is the 6th most supporters in the Brazil. Grêmio associates 92,000 people. The largest group of Grêmio supporters is Geral do Grêmio, the first and largest Brazilian barra brava,[31] movement similar to European ultras, but with unique characteristics of Latin America. The group was created during the year 2001 with Grêmio fans watching games from the seats behind the southern goal at Estádio Olímpico Monumental (an area of the stands called \"Geral\", as in \"general\", where tickets had lower costs). Over the following years, more people joined the movement, and they decided to collectively call themselves by the name of the area from where they watched the games. A unique and traditional feature of the crowd is running down the stand (a movement called the \"avalanche\"), pressing against the fence when a goal is scored as a way to also embrace the players in celebration. Being a barra brava, the Geral do Grêmio has differences with the ultras. On games they bring a band consisting of percussion and blowing instruments, dictating the rhythm of the chants throughout the game, never stopping or sitting. Banners and flags are exhibited in the length of the sector in which they are located inside the stadium, bringing a unique identity to their supporters. Also, wherever possible, they use flare, smoke bombs, fire extinguishers, among other materials to encourage the team on the field. In the Arena do Grêmio, which opened in December 2012, the lower northern stand was built with no chairs, with the Geral crowd and its \"avalanche\" celebration in mind. Later the avalanche celebration was made impossible by the addition of security metal bars. As the years went on, Grêmio and another important Brazilian football club, Internacional, started to form a rivalry. Soon the games between these two clubs got their own name, Grenal, and resulted in record attendance. Now the games fill the streets of Porto Alegre with football-crazed fans. In 1935, Eurico Lara, who was Grêmio's goalie, conceded a penalty kick. When the Internacional player was about to kick it, Lara's brother stopped the game and reminded him of his doctor's recommendation that he didn't overexert himself. He didn't listen. Soon the Internacional player took the shot. Lara caught it, but as soon as he did he fell sideways and didn't move. He was substituted after the wondrous save, and Grêmio won the game. But unfortunately he died two months later as a result of the fatigue from that game. Lara has been immortalized in the club anthem.
