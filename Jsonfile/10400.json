The total number of cases reported as of Apr 2022, is 1,867,572 consisting of 26,158 deaths and 1,840,342 who have recovered.[1] On 22 March, Delhi observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew (the Janata curfew) along with 75 districts in India, at the directive of the Prime Minister.[2][3] A nationwide lockdown was later issued for 21 days from 24 March.[4] Thousands of \"stranded migrant workers\" from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar gathered in the Anand Vihar Bus Station on 29 March 2020, trying to get back home after the nationwide lockdown was imposed.[5] More than 3000 people from a religious gathering in the Nizamuddin Markaz Mosque (in the Nizamuddin West area) were quarantined after suspicions that they had come in contact with infected people. 1300[citation needed] Tablighi Jamaat were part of this crowd, including foreigners in Markaz.[6][7][8] It was reported that air quality index of Delhi improved on 28 March 2020, after the lockdown had reduced traffic.[9] In April 2021, with cases increasing daily, CM Arvind Kejriwal announced a weekend curfew in Delhi every weekend. Notably, the traffic in the capital city decreased by a large amount. On 19 April 2021, Delhi turned the weekend curfew to a week-long lockdown.[10] The lockdown was extended several times - on April 25, May 2, May 9, May 15 until May 24 (as updated on May 19).[11] Now lockdown is unlocked on 8 June.[1] The Tablighi Jamaat wanted to meet in Vasai, Maharashtra, but an outbreak of COVID-19 caused them to relocate to Nizamuddin West. The Nizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held the religious congregational program (Ijtema) in Nizamuddin West, Delhi.[24][25][26] The Delhi Government's order that no seminars, conferences or any big event (beyond 200 people) should be held was ignored.[27][28] Many foreign speakers violeted safety protocols, including misuse of tourist visa for missionary activities, and not quarantining for two weeks.[29] At least 24 of the attendees had tested positive for the virus among the 300 who showed symptoms by 31 March 2020.[30] It is believed that the sources of infection were preachers from Indonesia.[31] Many had returned to their states, and also provided refuge to foreign speakers without the knowledge of local governments.[32] Eventually, local transmissions started, especially in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir and Assam. The entire Nizamuddin West was cordoned off by the Police as of 30 March, and medical camps were set up.[33] 167 of the attendees were quarantined in a railway facility in southeast Delhi amid concerns over their safety and over transmission of the virus. The Tablighi Jamaat gathering emerged as one of India's major coronavirus hotspots,[34] On 18 April 2020, Central Government of India said that 4,291 cases (or 29.8% of the 14,378 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India) were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, and these cases were spread across 23 states and Union Territories.[35] Questions have been raised as to how the Delhi Police allowed this event to proceed in the midst of a pandemic,[36] while a similar event was prohibited in Mumbai by the Maharashtra Police.[37] Once the COVID-19 lockdown came into effect in Delhi from 22 March onwards, the missionaries remaining in the Nizamuddin Markaz were trapped, and the functionaries began to seek assistance from the authorities for their evacuation.[38] Around 22,000 people that came in contact with the Tablighi Jamaat missionaries had to be quarantined.[39] On 31 March 2020, an FIR was filed against Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi and others by Delhi Police Crime Branch under Section 3 (penalty for offence) of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and 120b (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.[40][41][42] On 8 April 2020, the Delhi Police traced Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi in Zakirnagar in South-East Delhi, where he claimed to be under self-quarantine.[43] Many other members of the missionary group have also been booked for allegedly helping spread the disease, including by hiding in mosques, a police official claimed. The Government of India has denied that it is singling out Muslims.[44] On 12 March 2020, the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal declared COVID-19 an epidemic in Delhi.

Conferences and seminars of more than 200 people were also banned. The deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia invoked the example of the religious superspreader in South Korea, and said that the Delhi government was determined to prevent such incidents.[47] On 16 March, the ban was strengthened to all gatherings over 50 people, including those for religious, social, cultural, political, academic, sports etc. reasons.[48] On 19 March, Kejriwal announced that all restaurants will be closed until March 31 in view of the ever increasing cases of coronavirus.

This made it difficult for the Delhi government to make further plans for reopening. After reaching the lowest recorded cases in October, doctors began to express concerns that the city could turn out to be the epicentre of India's first wave of winter infections, with cases by mid-November being the highest since COVID-19 began.[64] On 31 December 2020 and 1 January 2021, curbs were placed preventing public gatherings at night for New Year's Eve.[65] The Delhi government issued an order making a seven-day quarantine mandatory for all asymptomatic individuals arriving in the city via planes and trains.[66] For symptomatic individuals, immediate COVID-19 testing on arrival, institutional quarantining until the result is out, moving to a hospital or a COVID-19 Care Center depending on symptoms if positive, and home isolation for 14 days in case of a negative result.[66] RWAs undertook regular sanitization drives with the help of the civic bodies, enforced social distancing, distributed masks and reined in those who were repeatedly violating norms.[67] On 23 March, the CM of Delhi had announced that 4 lakh people will get free food in Delhi from 24 March.[68] On 4 April, the Delhi Government had started to provide free food for 6.5 lakh people, including distressed migrant workers who were jobless in the current lockdown.[69] To provide food across all areas of Delhi, and to maintain physical distance, hygiene and sanitation, the government had converted night shelters and schools into free food distribution centers.[69] On 5 April, it was reported that out of 71 lakh ration card holders in Delhi, 60% had received ration.[70] As per the government until 5 April, 50,000 to 60,000 people who do not have ration cards, have applied for coupons to avail 5 kg of wheat, rice and sugar as free of cost.[ambiguous][70] Some people complained about the distribution of rations in a video conference with area MLAs including other party.
