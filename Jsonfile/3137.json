{"Content: ":"Night Time, My Time is the debut studio album by American singer Sky Ferreira, released on October 29, 2013, by Capitol Records. The album was originally set to be released in 2011, following the singles \"17\", \"One\", and \"Obsession\". However, they became commercial failures and caused her label to postpone the album repeatedly. As a result, many recording sessions were held for the album; some of which went towards two extended plays (EP), As If! (2011) and Ghost (2012). The final result includes work from Ferreira and producers including Ariel Rechtshaid, Justin Raisen, and Dan Nigro, which marks a departure from her previously released material. Musically, it is an indie rock and synth-pop album that explores 1980s pop music, 1990s grunge, and various styles of rock, while its lyrics convey themes such as failure, love, and anger. The album cover, shot by film director Gaspar Noé, portrays a topless Ferreira in a shower. Night Time, My Time received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its sound; it has been recognized by numerous media outlets as one of 2013's best albums and was ranked by Pitchfork as number 43 in a list of the 200 best albums of the 2010s. It was a modest success commercially; it debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 45 and on the Australian Albums Chart at number 40. Night Time, My Time was preceded by the digital release of its lead single \"You're Not the One\", accompanied by a music video. Capitol Records also issued \"24 Hours\" and \"Boys\" as free digital promotional singles, and although it was not released as a single, a music video was filmed for the album's title track. After releasing the tracks \"17\", \"One\", and \"Obsession\", Ferreira announced that her debut studio album would be released on January 11, 2011.[1] However, Ferreira's budget was dramatically reduced which led to the cancellation of the record;[2][3] such release was substituted with the extended play (EP) As If!, which was released on March 22, 2011.[4] In November 2011, Ferreira announced that her debut studio album would be released in 2012, with a lead single planned to precede its release that February.[5] The following month, she revealed that she was currently in the studio, working in her debut album with Jon Brion throughout 2012, and \"possibly\" with Shirley Manson and Greg Kurstin.[6] In early 2012, Ferreira renamed the LP Wild at Heart,[7] and confirmed \"24 Hours\" and \"Swamp Girl\" would be included in it.[8] Another song, entitled \"Lost in My Bedroom\", surfaced online that March.[9] After releasing the music video for the track \"Red Lips\" in June, she stated that she had renamed the record once again, changing its title to I'm Not Alright.[10] The album was also briefly referred to as I Will.[11] Ferreira began working with Ariel Rechtshaid, whom she contacted and met after Rechtshaid had heard \"One\" and subsequently \"liked\" Ferreira's Facebook page.[12][13] After her single \"Everything Is Embarrassing\" unexpectedly became popular on indie-oriented music blogs, Ferreira released another EP, Ghost, on October 16, 2012.[3][12][14] In early 2013, Ferreira intended to release an album composed of a mixture of tracks she had written and recorded with Brion and those she had written and recorded with Rechtshaid.[12][15] After the album experienced more delays, Ferreira decided to keep recording with Rechtshaid and co-producer Justin Raisen in order to make the album more cohesive in sound, dropping the Brion-produced tracks from the record.[12] After her record label refused to fund the album's recording sessions any further, Ferreira did so herself, with money she had earned from her modeling career to cover the costs of recording and equipment for these sessions.[3][16] A majority of the album's content was completely recorded, mixed, and mastered in just a few weeks during August 2013.[3][17][18] On August 29, 2013, Ferreira posted a photograph on her Facebook page indicating that the record was complete.[19] Night Time, My Time is an indie rock and synth-pop album,[20][21] exploring different musical styles of those heard on Ferreira's second EP Ghost (2012).[22] While the latter had a more \"relaxed\"[20] sonic atmosphere\u2014featuring electropop, synth-pop and acoustic styles[23]\u2014the album incorporates 1980s pop and 1990s grunge,[22] while also drawing inspiration from 1970s art rock and 1980s psychedelic rock, new wave, and post-punk.[24][25][26] The songs occasionally include guitars and \"hard-hitting\", as on \"I Will\" and \"You're Not the One\"; however, the album incorporates diverse music genres, including new wave on \"Love in Stereo\" and \"24 Hours\",[26][27] and ska on \"Kristine\".[28] Amongst other elements in the album's songs, are arcade game samples.[20] The atmosphere of the album was said to evoke records of Best Coast, Garbage, and Siouxsie and the Banshees with \"distorted tracks\".[29] Ferreira, who mostly sings in a low register,[27] explores a multitude of lyrical themes. A prominent one is failure,[25] provoked by record label manipulation and oppression.[3] Ferreira stated that the record was her try at getting the listeners to \"know [her]\", and further said that in the record, she felt like herself and that she had control over such lyricism.[3] However, another scope of themes is present on the record, such as love, inconstant relationships and feminism.[21][26] Her personality is reflected through an array of states of spirit\u2014frustration and anger are contrasted with vulnerability, \"redemption\" and self-confidence.[21][26][28][30][31] Night Time, My Time was named after lines spoken by Laura Palmer in the film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992).[32] Most of the people who had a problem with [the cover art] were men. At this point, I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry. But I'm making art and doing things that are true to my work. I'm not trying to sell my body, but it's my body to sell if I did want to! This kind of cover isn't even what sells \u2013 what sells is your face, shot by a fashion photographer, but I didn't want to do something like that. I do that all the time. \u2014 Ferreira on the controversy generated by the album's artwork[33] The artwork for Night Time, My Time was photographed by Argentine director Gaspar Noé at Hotel Amour in Paris,[17] and was unveiled by Ferreira on October 10, 2013.[34] It depicts the close-up of a topless Ferreira, whose left breast is exposed and is wearing a cross necklace, inside of a green-tiled shower.[35] She originally considered using another picture for the album artwork, and was additionally encouraged by Capitol Records to choose an older photograph where she was seen with \"long blonde hair [...] sitting on a bed looking cute [...] in a black dress looking pretty\". Ferreira ultimately selected the topless image because she felt it more accurately reflected the nature of the record.[18] The artwork for the album on most streaming services is censored and does not show her breasts. The uncensored version is available on the cover of the vinyl release. Night Time, My Time was released as a digital download through the iTunes Store in the United States on October 29, 2013,[36] where it was exclusively available until November 5, 2013.[37] It was additionally made available for pre-order on CD and LP formats, although Ferreira publicly criticized Capitol Records when they were unavailable for its initial release and announced that she would self-fund the creation of vinyl versions.[38] Following the launch of her third extended play Night Time, My Time: B-Sides Part 1 in November, her MyPlayDirect store began selling bundles that included a green translucent vinyl pressing, a compact disc, a digital download, and a poster of the album artwork.[39] Ferreira announced that the pre-ordered copies of Night Time, My Time were shipped on November 27,[40] while Capitol Records released their own vinyl versions of the record on January 28, 2014.[41] A limited edition that included Ferreira's second extended play Ghost (2012) was also released.[42] \"You're Not the One\" was released as the lead single from Night Time, My Time on September 24, 2013.[43] Its music video, paying visual homage to 1983 film The Hunger and set in a high-fashion nightclub, was released on the same day.[44][45] On November 25, 2013, Ferreira appeared on the program Late Show with David Letterman, where she performed the single.[46] \"24 Hours\" was released as a free promotional single on the same day of the album's release.[47] A music video for the album's title track, directed by Grant Singer and released on November 27, 2013, sees Ferreira wearing a variety of wigs and lingerie.[48] Natasha Stagg of V wrote that, in the video, Ferreira \"embraces the title she's been deemed by dressing in provocatively infantile accessories\" and \"cleverly [delivers] the junkie role back in her detractors' faces.\"[49] Consequence of Sound named the video among the best of 2013.[50] Though not a single, on December 19, 2014, \"Omanko\" received a music video, directed by Ferreira's then-boyfriend, DIIV frontman Zachary Cole Smith, consisting of \"silly homemade videos of Ferreira spliced with footage of her onstage performances\" in a lo-fi quality. The video was later taken off of YouTube by a copyright claim from Universal Music Group.[51] Prior to the album release, US tour dates featuring Ferreira alongside Vampire Weekend and Smith Westerns were revealed.[52] Due to a vocal injury, Ferreira canceled the tour with three shows remaining.[53] On November 25, 2013, a live concert with Ferreira was held at Rough Trade New York, followed by a signing session.[54] The attendance could purchase the original LP along with its Night Time, My Time: B-sides Part I EP.[54] In addition to serving as an opening act for several dates of Miley Cyrus's worldwide Bangerz Tour, Ferreira also promoted the record at one-off headlining shows and festival appearances throughout 2014, punctuated by a five-date run of West Coast shows in November.[55] Night Time, My Time received generally positive reviews from music critics.

Club commented that it seemed \"like the first release on which Ferreira is truly engaged with the music she's creating\", and placed particular praise towards her success in \"portraying [herself] as a complex person who's successfully discovered her own voice.\"[28] Lauren Martin from Fact appreciated that Ferreira \"[tells] personal tales of familiar issues of love, heartbreak and identity in refreshed and engaging ways\", which she elaborated was her personal \"highlight\" from the record.[20] Carrie Battan from Pitchfork stated that Night Time, My Time was \"one of the most pleasingly conventional and cohesive pieces of pop-rock to come along this year\" for integrating \"80s pop sparkle and full-bodied 90s grunge in a streamlined way.\"[22] Writing for PopMatters, Elias Leight felt that the fact that Night Time, My Time \"[came] out half a lifetime after she started trying to make music\" exemplified a \"survive and stay\" philosophy; he suggested that said dedication would provide Ferreira with career longevity.[64] Kevin Leidel from Slant Magazine commented that the record had the potential of becoming the \"gaunt, darkly painted neurosis\" that would successfully \"combat popular music's deluge of silly and crude self-affirmations.\"[27] Jordan Sargent from Spin enjoyed seeing Ferreira confidently and comfortably \"reveling in the swirling cacophony that is her sound and her life.\"[63] Referencing its frequent delays, Lavanya Ramanthan from The Washington Post opined that Night Time, My Time \"[normalized] the singer\" and \"might even have listeners rooting for her.\"[65] However, Stacey Anderson from Rolling Stone offered a more mixed review of Night Time, My Time; she criticized it for \"[sounding] like a soundtrack for The Breakfast Club remake playing in her head.\"[29] Samuel Tolzmann from the Pretty Much Amazing felt that the quality of the record dropped off from \"Omanko\" through the remainder of the album.[66] Benji Taylor of Clash panned the album as \"cheap theatrics masquerading as inspired art\".[67] Several media publications recognized Night Time, My Time as one of the best albums of 2013.
