{"Content: ":"Jim Chambers (March 16, 1927 \u2013 December 31, 1997) was an award winning halfback who played in the Western Interprovincial Football Union. A native of Montreal, and a graduate of the Westmount Warriors junior program, Chambers won the Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy for Canadian rookie of the year in the west by rushing for 513 yards and an amazing 9.9 yard average for the Edmonton Eskimos in 1951 (coupled with team mate and all-star Normie Kwong).[1] He played 3 seasons for the Eskimos,[2] rushing for 921 yards and catching 38 passes, but when all-star Rollie Miles joined the team he saw little playing time. He finished his career with the 1954 inaugural BC Lions team, playing 5 games, rushing for 27 yards and catching 4 passes.[3] He died on December 31, 1997 in Toronto, Ontario.[4]","Title":"Jim Chambers - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18449","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chambers"}
