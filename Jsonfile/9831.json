{"Content: ":"The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH; Thai: กระทรวงสาธารณสุข, RTGS: Krasuang Satharanasuk) is a Thai governmental body responsible for the oversight of public health in Thailand. It is commonly referred to in Thailand by its abbreviation so tho (สธ.). In Thailand before 1888 there were no permanent, public hospitals to provide care to sick people. Temporary hospitals were set up to care for patients during epidemics, then disbanded when the epidemic subsided. Under King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) a hospital was constructed and completed in 1888 and named \"Siriraj Hospital\" in commemoration of the king's young son, Prince Siriraj Kakudhabhand, who had died of dysentery.[3] King Vajiravudh, King Chulalongkorn's successor, established Department of Health on 27 November 1918. During the reign of King Rama VIII, the Ministry of Public Health was established on 10 March 1942 as a result of the enactment of the Ministries and Departments Reorganization Act (Amendment No. 3) of B.E. 2485. Later in 1966, the date 27 November was chosen as the commemoration day of the Ministry of Public Health's foundation.[3] The MOPH was allocated 135,389 million baht in the FY2019 budget.[4]","Title":"Ministry of Public Health (Thailand) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9831","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Public_Health_(Thailand)"}
