{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in North Macedonia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached North Macedonia in February 2020.[3] The initial contagion in the country was mainly connected with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy as there are circa 70,000 residents[4] of Italy from North Macedonia and resulted in many people returning to North Macedonia, bringing the virus with them.[5] As of 9 July, over 7,000 cases have been confirmed in the country, due to its second wave caused by family reunions during Eid al-Fitr among the Muslim minority and the overall re-opening of the country to organize the parliamentary elections.[6][7][8] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[9][10] The case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[11][12] but the transmission has been significantly higher, with a significant total death toll.[13][11]  On 26 February, North Macedonia confirmed its first case of SARS-CoV-2, a 50-year-old woman that got tested at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Skopje. She had been in Italy for a month and was sick for two weeks. Upon returning to North Macedonia, she immediately reported herself to the clinic.[14][15] This case was isolated and didn't lead to further infections.[citation needed] On 6 March, two more cases were confirmed positive: a married couple from Balanci, Centar Župa, who were residents of Brescia, Italy, and presumably returned to the country out of fear of the virus.[16] They entered North Macedonia on 27 February and went to the clinic in Debar on 2 March. They were not initially tested for SARS-CoV-2, but when their symptoms were getting worse, they were tested on 6 March. After getting positive results, the couple was transferred to the Clinic in Skopje to be taken care of.[17] On 9 March the number of infected people in the country increased to 7 - three family members of the cases registered on 6 March and Nina Caca Biljanovska, the director of the Clinic for Skin Diseases in Skopje. Biljanovska's incident caused controversy, as she did not self-isolate after returning from a vacation in Italy. Moreover, she had continued going to work and was a speaker at a conference attended by 100 people before getting tested. The Minister of health subsequently fired her.[18][19] On 10 March, after a formal request from the mayor of Debar[20] (the city where 5 of the 7 cases were found) and the controversies regarding Biljanovska the Ministry of Health of North Macedonia implemented more reliable measures to prevent further spreading of the virus, including temporary two-week closure of all education institutes (from kindergartens to universities), the prohibition of travelling to the most infected countries (China, Korea, Italy, France, Germany, etc.), the ban of all public events and closure of sports events to the public.[21] Later that day, the first case was confirmed to tested negatively on the repeated coronavirus test. The patient, however, is still recovering in the hospital.[22] On 11 March two more cases were confirmed positive, both from Debar[23] They are related to the first cases registered in the town. On 13 March four more cases were confirmed positive. As all 4 were from Debar, the Government declared a state of emergency in the municipalities of Debar and Centar Župa. All movement inside and outside the two quarantined districts was banned; only people living there were allowed to return to their homes.[24] Later on, President Pendarovski made a decision on the engagement of the Army in affected areas in Debar and Centar Župa.[25] Also, it was announced that entries of foreign nationals to the country arriving from 'high-risk countries' would start getting denied.[26] On 14 March, 8 people were tested for coronavirus, 6 of which returned positive (5 from Debar and one from Skopje returning from a trip to Barcelona, Spain). A total of 14 of the patients were hospitalized at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Skopje, while the 5 new cases from Debar remained in the local hospital.[27] On 16 March, 7 persons (5 officially) were positive (4 from Debar, 1 from Skopje and two tested in a private clinic). The patient in Skopje had just returned from a trip to the Netherlands via Vienna, the two additional cases tested positive in the private Žan Mitrev Hospital. They got retested by the public laboratory the following day, and their positive results got confirmed.[28] Because of the increased number of cases, both domestically and globally, the Government of North Macedonia decided to close the two international airports (Skopje and Ohrid) and ban foreigners from entering the country. The ban does not affect diplomats and medical personnel (which are required to obtain permission from the Ministry of Interior) and truck drivers.[29] On 17 March 5 new positive cases were confirmed - 4 in Debar (two nurses and two doctors, one of whom was Arben Agolli, former mayoral candidate and political activist[30]) and one in Skopje, raising the number to 32.[31] Political leaders decided to postpone the early parliamentary elections scheduled for 12 April.[32] On 18 March, 4 new cases were confirmed positive, all of them Macedonian citizens from Skopje coming from Belgium[33] Prime Minister Oliver Spasovski announced that the Government is considering declaring a State of Emergency in the country, something that had never happened before.[34] The State of Emergency was officially proclaimed by the President later the same day, and following this event, since the Parliament was dismissed, the Government gained legislative and executive power.[35] Later that day 7 more people were tested positive on the virus (4 in Skopje and 3 in Debar).[36] On 19 March, 6 new cases were confirmed positive: 3 in Debar, 1 in Skopje, 1 in Gostivar, and 1 in Štip. The case from Gostivar is a Macedonian citizen coming from Switzerland, the case from Štip is a 4-year-old that got infected at a kindergarten in England and the rest are domestic citizens related to previously confirmed cases.[37] On 20 March, 19 new cases, all of them in Skopje, were confirmed positive. 17 of them were tested at the private Žan Mitrev Hospital.[38] With this outbreak, Skopje surpassed Debar in the number of confirmed cases. Later the same day, 3 people tested positive (2 in Skopje and 1 in Štip). One of the people from Skopje said that she had travelled to Serbia before she was confirmed positive.[39] Again, later the same day, 6 new cases tested positive (4 in Skopje and a married couple in Kavadarci).[40] On 21 March, 9 new cases were confirmed positive: 7 in Skopje and 2 in Štip.[41] Later the same day the Government imposed a curfew as a protection measure against the virus outbreak.

They said that the protocols for physical education in the schools were adopted.[246] Preparatory measures against a potential outbreak started in late January 2020. National measures against the pandemic are led by Health Minister Venko Filipče and the Commission for Infectious Diseases. Filipče stated that the state has made preparations to deal with the virus if it appears in North Macedonia. He said that the preparations had been made in terms of staff, infrastructure, equipment, places for hospitalization of patients, and that the country is ready for the virus.[247] Besides all that, the response of the Government has been criticized as illogical on several occasions by the population. One of the most controversial decisions was related to a local curfew of the Skopje area that prompted massive exodus into smaller towns.[248][249] Another was the Government's decision to grant travel vouchers to citizens; that is believed to have caused a second wave in Ohrid, mainly due to non-enforcement of social distancing rules and a massive influx of domestic tourists.[250] In general, people were pessimistic about the Governments conducts. A public opinion poll was done; 44% of respondents had estimated that the country was moving in the wrong direction.[251] Starting from 27 January, thermal cameras installed at the Skopje Airport, started monitoring passengers coming from Istanbul and Dubai who serve as links to China, which was at the moment the epicenter of the epidemic.[252] Following the first meeting with WHO representative Jihane Tawilah, the country's preparedness for early detection & stopping the spread of the virus was assessed as satisfactory. Health minister Venko Filipče announced that North Macedonia's healthcare system is completely prepared for a potential outbreak. In addition to the thermal cameras, information leaflets were distributed to police stations and the custom checks at all border passes.[citation needed] On 4 February, the first reagents to detect the virus were imported from Niš, Serbia. Filipče said that at the moment, the country had about 40,000 surgical masks and medical protective suits, but additional procurement was considered for preparing the country for a potential outbreak.[253] Since early February, the Institute for Public Health has been in close contact with the WHO and has been implementing their recommendations.[254] On 6 February, the first set of preventive recommendations were announced to the public - ranging from frequent hand washing, using a handkerchief when sneezing or coughing, avoiding unprotected contact with sick people etc. On this day, Filipče met with the Chinese ambassador in North Macedonia, Zhang Zuo, and it was agreed that all Sinohydro workers would have to undergo a 14-day quarantine before returning to their posts in North Macedonia.[255] Following a meeting with Filipče on 15 February, WHO representative Jihane Tawilah announced that they regard North Macedonia's system for early detection and early intervention of infectious diseases as one of the best in the region.[256] On 24 February, on a meeting of the Centre for Crisis Management, it was decided that all passengers arriving from Northern Italy will be required to enter the country from a reduced number of border passes and that they will be interviewed by the police and the specially appointed medical staff. At the Skopje Airport, thermal cameras would screen all arriving passengers regardless of the destination, and thermal guns at Ohrid Airport would screen patients arriving from high-risk destinations. It was also announced that apart from the Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje, three more hospitals (in Štip, Veles and Gostivar) will receive potential COVID-19 patients. Filipče appealed to all Macedonian citizens to cancel all but urgent trips to Northern Italy. At that point, the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy was at the very beginning, with about 220 confirmed cases and 7 deaths.[257][258][259] The next day, 25 February, the government officially recommended all trips to Northern Italy to be cancelled. Patients returning from Northern Italy would be given recommendations on what to do if they develop symptoms similar to COVID-19: it was not required, however, for them to undergo a 14-day quarantine. Also, several phone numbers were introduced for patients experiencing symptoms similar to COVID-19, and potential patients were instructed not to visit the hospitals before calling these phone numbers. Following a social media campaign by high school students, the Ministry of Health procured new quantities of soap and disinfectants for all schools and kindergartens in the country.[260][261][262] On 26 February, the country confirmed its first case of SARS-CoV-2, a 50-year-old woman that got tested at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Skopje, arriving from Italy where she had been sick for two weeks. The Ministry of Health held two conferences that day, explaining the contact-tracing system that was going to be used for every SARS-CoV-2 positive case: namely, all contacts of a positive person will be ordered to self-isolate for two weeks. Wearing of face masks was recommended for all suspected cases; however, healthy persons were given recommendations not to wear masks. No additional measures were announced.[263] On 28 February, the government recommended all mass gatherings to be cancelled: this included the carnivals in Strumica and Prilep. It was also recommended for all sports events to take place without any audience until 6 March. This measure was later extended to 13 March. The government also appealed to all employees in the state or local institutions, employees in the school system, as well as pupils and students who had traveled to risk countries in the past two weeks to avoid going to work or school.[264][265] Starting from 4 March, WizzAir passengers arriving from Treviso and Milan were required to fill a questionnaire during the flight.[266] Disregarding the recommendations and measures against the spread of the virus has been noted in the institutions as well. Among the first positives of the virus was the director of the Clinic for Skin Diseases in Skopje, who did not call for an examination after returning from Italy and went to work for five days.[267] On the same day, 9 May, a total of 90 people who had contact with her or were present at the clinic were placed in two-week isolation, and the clinic itself was closed. The skin department and the skin disease clinic in Štip are also closed because doctors from the institutions attended a symposium in Skopje, where the director participated.[268] Minister Venko Filipče announced that non-compliance with anti-virus measures would be punishable by a fine of up to one year in prison.[269] A similar case was reported on 20 March in Kavadarci, where a doctor from the General Hospital went to work despite the prescribed measure for self-isolation of his entire family. He was fined 4,500 euros. He was convicted of \"failing to comply with health regulations during an epidemic.\"[270] The director of the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Ohrid was fired on 29 March because the 66-year-old woman from Struga, who is thought to have died of the virus, was not admitted to the clinic.[271][272] A day after the case was discovered with the director of the clinic in Skopje, the Macedonian authorities started tightening the measures against the spread of the virus. On 11 March, all educational institutions in the country were closed. Due to the introduction of this measure, the Government decided that one of the parents of a child up to 10 years of age should have the right to stay at home with paid leave.[273] Since most of the infected were from the neighbouring municipalities of Debar and Centar Župa, which are located in the western part of Macedonia, on 13 March a crisis situation was declared in these two municipalities. They are practically quarantined, with an increased presence of emergency services and the deployment of an army to control the spread of the virus.[274] At that time, there were currently 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection across the country. In the next few days, a series of measures have been introduced to massively prevent the pandemic, closing restaurants and shopping malls, as well as airports and border crossings for foreign nationals, banning mass public gatherings.[275] On 18 March, the government led by Technical Prime Minister Oliver Spasovski called for a state of emergency to be declared throughout the country. As the Assembly was dissolved due to the announced elections, the request was forwarded to President Stevo Pendarovski.[276] On the same day, Pendarovski declared a state of emergency throughout the territory for at least 30 days. He announced this at a press conference at 6 pm. This is the first time in the history of the country that an emergency measure has been introduced. At the time of the introduction of the measure, there were 35 patients with coronavirus. With this, the Government, in addition to the executive power, also received the legislative power in the country, so that it was allowed to bring decrees with legal force. Pendarovski pointed out that the state of emergency is also important for the economy. Pendarovski said that for the government to continue to function as a technical one, is a chance for the government and the opposition to work together and \"not worry about their political ratings.\"[277] From 23 March, a daily curfew began throughout the country from 9 pm to 6 am to deal with the pandemic. This prohibited the movement of the population anywhere in the country during these hours. Authorities have criticized the timing of the curfew. The Helsinki Committee reacted that the purpose of this measure is unclear because, during the day parks, playgrounds and other public areas remained the main gathering places of large groups of people.[278] In the following days, the ban on movement restricted contact between adults over the age of 67, who are considered a risk group, and young people under the age of 18, who may be carriers of the virus.[279] Farmers are excluded from the ban on the movement.[280] In March, some municipalities called for a state of emergency on their territory.[281] On 3 April, a complete ban on the movement of the population in the Municipality of Kumanovo during the weekend was introduced. During the introduction of the prohibition in this municipality, there were a total of 85 infected with the virus. In this case, only farmers were allowed to move around the villages, exclusively for work.[282] On 14 April, Debar and Centar Župa were officially released from the lockdown after 10 days without any cases.[283] Then, the army reallocated in Kumanovo, where the situation was now critical.[284] On 22 April, curfews were eased but everyone was required to wear masks or scarfs in public places and indoor places (like supermarkets, shops, public transport).[285] Warnings were given till 30 April. After that, people had to pay 20 euros for breaking the decree; 2,000 euros for people connected with law and 1,000 euros for responsible workers in a company.[286] On 8 May, the curfew on the weekends was eased. Going outside in the weekends was allowed from 5 AM to 7 PM like in the weekdays.[287] Health minister Venko Filipče said that starting from 14 May, there will be screenings in the kindergartens. The employees have already been recruited for work but they had to be tested first. On 15 May for example, 184 tests have been made: 106 in Bitola, 6 in Veles and 72 in Skopje. Only one worker was found positive, from Bitola.[288] The screenings continued throughout whole May, which even more employees are currently being tested.[289] Same day, it was announced that adults over 67 and young people under 18 were allowed to go outside from 5 am to 7 pm as the others. Previously for 67> the time was from 5 am to 12 pm and <18 from 1 pm to 7 pm.[290] Furthermore, president Stevo Pendarovski extended the state of emergency on 16 May, which had expired, for 14 more days.[291] On 22 May, the curfew for the following weekend changed due to the upcoming holidays. It started from 11 am Sunday - 24 May, till 5 am Tuesday - 26 May.[292]   The countries and international organizations that have sent aid and funds to the Government of North Macedonia, to help fight the pandemic:","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in North Macedonia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10585","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_North_Macedonia"}
