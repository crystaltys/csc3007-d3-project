{"Content: ":"A United Nations General Assembly Resolution is a decision or declaration voted on by all member states of the United Nations in the General Assembly. General Assembly resolutions usually require a simple majority (50 percent of all votes plus one) to pass. However, if the General Assembly determines that the issue is an \"important question\" by a simple majority vote, then a two-thirds majority is required; \"important questions\" are those that deal significantly with the maintenance of international peace and security, admission of new members to the United Nations, suspension of the rights and privileges of membership, the expulsion of members, operation of the trusteeship system, or budgetary questions. Although General Assembly resolutions are generally non-binding towards member states, internal resolutions may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself, for example with regard to budgetary and procedural matters.","Title":"United Nations General Assembly resolution - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9411","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution"}
