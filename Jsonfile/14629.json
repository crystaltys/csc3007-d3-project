{"Content: ":"Sri Lanka scores higher than the regional average in healthcare having a high Life expectancy and a lower maternal and infant death rate than its neighbors.[1][2] In 2018 life expectancy was 72.1 for men and 78.5 for women ranking the country 70th in the world.[3] Sri Lankans eat a variety of foods that can form a wholesome and healthy diet. The long history of vegetarianism on the island has led to a variety of vegetable dishes, while a long-standing commitment to using natural sweeteners such as kithul (treacle) means Sri Lanka has avoided the issues related to the overuse of sugar in diets. A substantial use of fish, instead of other meats, has also increased the healthiness of the Sri Lankan diet.[citation needed] While Sri Lankans tend to eat food that should achieve a healthy diet, the manner in which they casually choose how much food to eat often results in diet-related health problems. The diet can often contain too much carbohydrates, due to a cultural preference for finding rice and other staples appetizing, increasing the chance of diabetes, while disproportionately leaving out vegetable-based side dishes, and often completely leaving out dairy-based dishes. An overuse of oil and coconut oil has also been identified as a cause of diet-related problems.[4] People can access more health related news / medical news like diseases, management guidelines, updated researches on Sri Lanka by visiting one of the trusted most popular health related news website named Drnews.lk.","Title":"Health in Sri Lanka - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14629","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Sri_Lanka"}
