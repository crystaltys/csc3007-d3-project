{"Content: ":"HM Loyal Opposition Crossbench The National Assembly and the Queen of Saint Christopher and Nevis jointly make up the legislature of Saint Kitts and Nevis.[1] The assembly has 14 or 15 members (depending upon circumstances), 11 of whom are elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies and are known as Representatives. The remaining four are called Senators; three are appointed by the governor-general and the fourth is the attorney-general (i.e. an ex officio member). The 1983 constitution mandates at least three senators, or four if the attorney-general is not one of these three appointed senators. The number can be increased by the parliament as long as it doesn't exceed two thirds of the number of representatives. Except for the attorney-general, the senators are appointed by the governor-general, acting on the advice of the prime minister in two of the appointments and the leader of the opposition for the third one. Parliament is empowered by the 1983 constitution to make laws for the Peace, order, and good government of the federation, excepting those areas in the exclusive competence of the Nevis Island Legislature.[2] Following passage by the National Assembly, Royal Assent is required to be given by the Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis.[3] Amendments to the constitution require a two-thirds supermajority in the Assembly.[4] The Assembly has a speaker and deputy speaker elected by the members of the parliament during its first meeting following a general election. They do not have to be members of it; but if they are then they cannot also be in the cabinet or parliamentary secretaries. The current speaker of the National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis is Anthony Michael Perkins, who has been in office since June 2016. He succeeded Franklin Brand.
