{"Content: ":"The end-Botomian mass extinction event, also known as the late early Cambrian extinctions, refer to two extinction intervals that occurred during Stages 4 and 5 of the Cambrian Period, approximately 513 to 509 million years ago. Estimates for the decline in global diversity over these events range from 50% of marine genera[1] up to 80%.[2] Among the organisms affected by this event were the small shelly fossils, archaeocyathids (an extinct group of sponges), trilobites, brachiopods, hyoliths, and mollusks.[1][3][4][5] There are several hypotheses for the causes of these extinctions. There is evidence that major changes in the carbon cycle[6][7][8][9] and sea level occurred during this time.[1][10] Evidence also exists for the development of anoxia (a loss of oxygen) in some environments in the oceans.[1][11][12] One hypothesis that unifies this evidence links these environmental changes to widespread volcanic eruptions caused by the emplacement of the Kalkarindji Large Igneous Province or LIP.[13][14] These widespread eruptions would have injected large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causing warming of the climate and subsequent acidification and loss of oxygen in the oceans.[13] However the precise timing between the eruptions and the extinction events remain unresolved.[14]","Title":"End-Botomian mass extinction - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11903","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-Botomian_mass_extinction"}
