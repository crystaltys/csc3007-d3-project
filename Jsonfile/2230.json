{"Content: ":"A duck decoy (or decoy duck) is a man-made object resembling a real duck. Duck decoys are sometimes used in waterfowl hunting to attract real ducks. Duck decoys were historically carved from wood, often Atlantic white cedar wood on the east coast of the US from Maine to South Carolina,[1] or cork. Modern ones may also be made of canvas and plastic. They are usually painted, often elaborately and very accurately, to resemble various kinds of waterfowl. Ever since Joel Barber, the first-known decoy collector, started in 1918, decoys have become increasingly viewed as an important form of North American folk art. Barber's book Wild Fowl Decoys, was the first book on decoys as collectible objects. It was followed in 1965 by folk art dealer Adele Earnest's The Art of the Decoy and American Bird Decoys by collector William F. Mackey. Mackey made many trips to Chincoteague Island for the great flounder fishing as well as hunting for Chincoteague decoys. On his trips to the island he called Snug Harbor Marina home. He would send out locals to search for great finds of Chincoteague history. Cigar Daisey was one of the local Chincoteaguers that would help Mackey find all the best decoys that made his collection world-famous.[peacock prose] Daisey has told many stories of the many truck loads of decoys he rounded up for his friend. By that time, Hal & Barbara Sorenson, hobbyists from Burlington, Iowa, had published the Decoy Collectors Guide, a small magazine dedicated to the practice. The 'Guide' helped foster a sense of community and provided a forum for collectors to share their research. By the 1970s decoys were becoming big business, at least by previous standards. The death of Wm. F. Mackey brought his decoys to market in a series of auctions in 1973 and 1974, with the star of his collection, a long-billed curlew by Wm. 'Bill' Bowman selling for a record US$10,500. Since the 1960s numerous collectors organizations have been created, specialist books and magazines published, with specialist dealers, and special interest have been shown around the US and Canada. Canadian decoys are still believed to be the \"sleepers\" in the world of decoy popularity and are often undervalued but are starting to gain recognition. The current world record price for an antique duck decoy at auction is a red-breasted merganser hen by Lothrop Holmes for $856,000. Guyette & Deeter[2] and Christie's New York. January 2007.[3] The first million dollar price was achieved when two decoys (Canada goose and a preening pintail drake) by A. Elmer Crowell of East Harwich, MA were said to have sold for US$1.13 million each in a private sale, in September 2007. The record-setting decoys were sold in a larger collection of 31 decoys for $7.5 million in total so it remains for a single decoy to clearly break the $1 million mark.[4] The most famous of all factory-made decoys are Mason's which operated in Detroit, Michigan, from 1896 to 1924. Produced decoys in the same style as Peterson and Dodge. Produced five grades of decoys:","Title":"Duck decoy (model) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2230","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_decoy_(model)"}
