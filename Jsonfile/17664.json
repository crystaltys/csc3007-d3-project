{"Content: ":"Kangxi Dynasty is a 2001 Chinese television series based on the novel Kangxi Da Di (康熙大帝; The Great Kangxi Emperor) by Eryue He. The series is a prequel to the 1997 television series Yongzheng Dynasty, and was followed by Qianlong Dynasty in 2002. The series focuses on the major events which occurred during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty. These include the power struggle with Oboi, the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, and the campaign against the Kingdom of Tungning. The series was partially produced on location at the House of the Huangcheng Chancellor in rural Shanxi, the home of Chen Tingjing, a minister of the Kangxi Emperor who served as the chief editor for his dictionary.[1] Kangxi Dynasty won the Outstanding Drama award at the 20th Golden Eagle Television Awards in 2002. Although the series was generally popular, it received lower ratings than its predecessor, Yongzheng Dynasty, a similar television series about the Kangxi Emperor's son and successor, the Yongzheng Emperor. The series was criticised by some for being wrought with historical inaccuracies. Critics also pointed out its unnecessary emphasis on Taiwan, a contemporary issue. Some major events during Kangxi's reign were omitted, such as his contributions to the Chinese language with the Kangxi Dictionary, and the contention for the succession among Kangxi's sons, which is featured more prominently in Yongzheng Dynasty.","Title":"Kangxi Dynasty - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17664","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Dynasty"}
