Sproul was born at John Douglass House to William Hall and Deborah Dickinson (Slokom) Sproul[3] in Colerain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on September 16, 1870. The family relocated to Chester, Pennsylvania in 1883, and Sproul graduated from Chester High School in 1887.[4] He attended Swarthmore College, was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and graduated with honors in 1891. After graduation, Sproul acquired an interest in the Franklin Printing Company of Philadelphia. Sproul later purchased a half interest in the Chester Times newspaper.[4] Sproul was employed in the field of newspaper publishing, and rose to the rank of president of the Chester Daily Times.[5] Additionally, he made a substantial profit through investments in railroads and manufacturing interests. In 1895, Sproul was elected a director of the First National Bank of Chester. In 1898, he became vice president of the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works but resigned a year later when he organized the Seaboard Steel Casting Company and served as president.
