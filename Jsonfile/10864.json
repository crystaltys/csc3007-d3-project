On 3 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have spread to Argentina.[2][3][4][5] As of 28 July 2022, a total of 9,507,562 people were confirmed to have been infected, and 129,278 people were known to have died because of the virus.[6] On 7 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first documented death, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris, France, who also had other health conditions; the case was only confirmed as positive after the patient's demise.[7] On 19 March 2020, a nationwide lockdown was established in Argentina.[8][9] The lockdown was lifted throughout all the country, excepting the Greater Buenos Aires urban area (where 31.9% of the country's population live),[10] on 10 May, with Greater Buenos Aires locked down until 17 July, where the lockdown was due to be gradually loosened in several stages to lead to the return to normality.[11] However, restrictions were extended several times until 8 November 2020.[12] During the second wave, another nationwide lockdown took place from 22 to 31 May 2021.[13] On February 4, the cruise ship Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Port of Yokohama in Japan when 10 passengers were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.[19] Among the passengers diagnosed positive was the first Argentine infected, a 61-year-old man travelling with his wife, who had no symptoms. The patient was transferred to a hospital in Japan \"for studies and treatment\".[20] The other seven Argentines on board, including his wife, remained on the cruise in quarantine until February 21.[21] The man was in perfect health and was released on February 17. He finally left Japan on February 24 and arrived in Argentina on February 26, moving to his home in the city of Buenos Aires.[22]","Title":"Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10864","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Argentina"}
