{"Content: ":"In medicine, any disease is classified asymptomatic if a patient tests as carrier for a disease or infection but experiences no symptoms. Whenever a medical condition fails to show noticeable symptoms after a diagnosis it might be considered asymptomatic. Infections of this kind are usually called subclinical infections. Diseases such as mental illnesses or psychosomatic conditions are considered subclinical if they present some individual symptoms but not all those normally required for a clinical diagnosis. The term clinically silent is also found. Producing only a few, mild symptoms, disease is paucisymptomatic. Symptoms appearing later, after an asymptomatic incubation period, mean a pre-symptomatic period has existed. Knowing that a condition is asymptomatic is important because: Subclinical or subthreshold conditions are those for which the full diagnostic criteria are not met and have not been met in the past, although symptoms are present. This can mean that symptoms are not severe enough to merit a diagnosis,[4] or that symptoms are severe but do not meet the criteria of a condition.[5] The DSM-5 has a range of subclinical diagnoses called \"other specified\" and \"unspecified\" disorders to fit this category, including Other specified feeding or eating disorder and other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder. An example of an asymptomatic disease is cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is a member of the herpes virus family. \"It is estimated that 1% of all newborns are infected with CMV, but the majority of infections are asymptomatic.\" (Knox, 1983; Kumar et al. 1984)[6] In some diseases, the proportion of asymptomatic cases can be important. For example, in multiple sclerosis it is estimated that around 25% of the cases are asymptomatic, with these cases detected postmortem or just by coincidence (as incidental findings) while treating other diseases.[7] These are conditions for which there is a sufficient number of documented individuals that are asymptomatic that it is clinically noted. For a complete list of asymptomatic infections see subclinical infection. Millions of women reported lack of symptoms during pregnancy until the point of childbirth or the beginning of labor; they didn't know they were pregnant. This phenomenon is known as cryptic pregnancies. [8]","Title":"Asymptomatic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9688","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"}
