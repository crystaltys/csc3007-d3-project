{"Content: ":"The 2022 monkeypox outbreak in India is a part of the ongoing outbreak of human monkeypox caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. The outbreak was first reported in India on 14 July 2022 when Kerala's State Health Minister Veena George announced a suspected imported case which was confirmed hours later by the NIV. India was the tenth country to report a monkeypox case in Asia and the first in South Asia. Currently, India has reported four confirmed cases of monkeypox, three of them in Kerala and one in Delhi, and eight suspected cases, one case each in Delhi and Telangana, two in Bihar and four in Uttar Pradesh. On 24 July, the first locally transmitted case was reported in Delhi. The individual, a middle-aged male who had no recent history of travelling abroad, was isolated in the Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi. Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and some other animals.[1] Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over.[1] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from five to twenty-one days.[2][3] The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks.[3] There may be mild symptoms, and it may occur without any symptoms being known.[2][4] The classic presentation of fever and muscle pains, followed by swollen glands, with lesions all at the same stage, has not been found to be common to all outbreaks.[1][5] Cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems.[6] The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus. The variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is also in this genus.[7] Of the two types in humans, the West African type causes a less severe disease than the Central African (Congo basin) type.[8] It may spread from infected animals by handling infected meat or via bites or scratches.[9] Human-to-human transmission can occur through exposure to infected body fluids or contaminated objects, by small droplets, and possibly through the airborne route.[1][9] People can spread the virus from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and fallen off; with some evidence of spread for more than a week after lesions have crusted.[8] Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing a lesion for the virus's DNA.[10] An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox, a viral disease, was confirmed in May 2022.[17] The initial cluster of cases was found in the United Kingdom,[18] where the first case was detected on 6 May 2022 in an individual with travel links to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic).[19] The outbreak marked the first time monkeypox has spread widely outside Central and West Africa. From 18 May onwards, cases were reported from an increasing number of countries and regions, predominantly in Europe but also in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.[26] On 23 July, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), raising the status of the outbreak to a global health emergency.[27][28] As of 28 July, there were a total of 20,846 confirmed cases.[29] A large portion of those infected were believed to have not recently traveled to areas of Africa where monkeypox is normally found, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa. It is believed to be transmitted by close contact with sick people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing. The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa.[32] In addition to more common symptoms, such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and rashes or lesions, some patients have also experienced proctitis, an inflammation of the rectum lining. CDC has also warned clinicians to not rule out monkeypox in patients with sexually transmitted infections since there have been reports of co-infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes.[33] On 14 July, a suspected monkeypox case was reported in the South-Indian state of Kerala by the State health minister Veena George. The patient was reportedly in close contact with a person who tested positive for monkeypox abroad in the United Arab Emirates, and arrived in India from UAE four days prior to the announcement.[34][35][36] Hours later, minister Veena George announced that the patient was confirmed to be infected with the monkeypox disease by the NIV of Pune.[citation needed] No community transmission or locally transmitted cases were detected in India until on 24 July, Delhi reported their first case, and the patient had no history of travel from abroad. He recently attended a party in Himachal Pradesh. Although community transmission of the disease in India wasn\u2019t confirmed by the government health officials. 14 July: A suspected monkeypox case was reported in Kerala. State health minister Veena George said that the patient was in close contact with a person who tested positive for monkeypox. The patient arrived in India from the United Arab Emirates four days earlier, according to the health minister, and was admitted to a hospital in the state after the patient showed symptoms, and samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV). It was also reported that tests in local hospitals confirmed that the individual was affected with disease, but still samples were sent to the NIV for confirmation, as per the guideline given by the central government.[34][35][36] 26 July: A suspected case was reported in Patna, Bihar. After the outbreak was highlighted on mid-May, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya directed the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to keep a close watch and monitor the situation. The Union Health Ministry has also directed airport and other port health officers to be vigilant and have been instructed to isolate and send samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune of any sick passenger with a travel history to infected countries.[37]","Title":"2022 monkeypox outbreak in India - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9847","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_monkeypox_outbreak_in_India"}
