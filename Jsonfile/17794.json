{"Content: ":"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Fortaleza (Latin: Archidioecesis Fortalexiensis) is an archdiocese located in the city of Fortaleza in Brazil. On June 6, 1854, it was established by Pope Pius IX, as the Diocese of Ceará from the Diocese of Olinda. Formerly a part of the Diocese of Pernambuco, the district was erected into a separate diocese, suffragan to the Archdiocese of Bahia. João Guerino Gomes was named as first bishop but did not accept the appointment. Father Gomes, who was famous in his day both as an orator and as a philosopher, died in 1859. The first bishop, Luis Antonio dos Santos, founded the diocesan seminaries at Fortaleza and Crato, and, for the education of girls, the College of the Immaculate Conception, besides building the church of the Sacred Heart at Fortaleza.[1] On November 10, 1915, it was promoted as the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Fortaleza.
