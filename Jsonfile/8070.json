{"Content: ":"Somatostatin receptors are receptors for the ligand somatostatin, a small neuropeptide associated with neural signaling, particularly in the post-synaptic response to NMDA receptor co-stimulation/activation. Somatostatin is encoded by a CRE and is very susceptible to gene promoter region activation by transcription factor CREB.[1] There are five known somatostatin receptors:[2] All are G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors.
