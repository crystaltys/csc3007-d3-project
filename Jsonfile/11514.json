{"Content: ":"Acipenseriformes /æsɪˈpɛnsərɪfɔːrmiːz/ is an order of basal[1] ray-finned fishes that includes living and fossil sturgeons and paddlefishes (Acipenseroidei), as well as the extinct families Chondrosteidae and Peipiaosteidae.[2][3][4] They are the second earliest diverging group of living ray-finned fish after the bichirs. Despite being early diverging, they are highly derived, having only weakly ossified skeletons that are otherwise mostly made of cartilage, and in modern representatives highly modified skulls.[5] The axial skeleton of Acipenseriformes is only partially ossified, with the majority of the bones being replaced with cartilage. The notochord, usually only found in fish embryos, is unconstricted and retained throughout life.[6] The premaxilla and maxilla bones of the skull present in other vertebrates have been lost. The infraorbital nerve is carried by a series of separate canals, rather than being within the circumorbital bones. The palatoquadrate bones of the skull possess a cartilaginous symphysis (joint), and also have a broad autopalatine plate, as well as a a narrow palatoquadrate bridge, and a quadrate flange. The quadratojugal bone is three-pointed (triradiate), and the dentition on the gill-arch is confined to the upper part of the first arch and to only the first and second hypobranchials.[5] Acipenseriformes are assumed to have evolved from a \"palaeonisciform\" ancestor. Their closest relatives within the paleonisciformes are uncertain and contested.[5] The oldest unambiguous members of the order are the Chondrosteidae, a group of large fish found in marine deposits from the Early Jurassic of Europe, which already have reduced ossification of the skeleton.[7] The Peipiaosteidae are known from the Middle-Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous freshwater deposits in Asia.[8] The oldest known paddlefish is known from the Early Cretaceous of China.[9] While the earliest known sturgeons appear in the Late Cretaceous in North America and Asia.[10] The classification is based on the work of Mikko Haaramo,[11] Nelson, Grande and Wilson 2016[12] and van der Laan 2016.[13] Most living species of Acipenseriformes are classified as threatened (mostly endangered or critically endangered) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Chinese paddlefish was last seen alive in 2003, and was considered to have gone extinct sometime between 2005 and 2010 by the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute in their 2019 report. A study published in 2020 reported a successful hybridization between a Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii) and an American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), indicating that the two species can breed with one another despite their lineages having been separated for hundreds of millions of years. This has marked the first successful hybridization between members of Acipenseridae and Polyodontidae.[15] ","Title":"Acipenseriformes - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11514","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acipenseriformes"}
