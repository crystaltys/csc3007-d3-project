Governor Al Smith was appointed as its first President, and Robert Moses, who had drafted the bill creating the Commission served until 1953. The Commission was abolished in 1977, its parks being taken over by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and its parkways by the New York State Department of Transportation.
