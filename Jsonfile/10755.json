The document advocated for those who had been to China recently to self-monitor for 14 days, and that those exhibiting no symptoms after the 14-day period were able to return to their normal lives.[7][8] In late February, greater precautions were undertaken by different organizations to be prepared for the potential spread of the virus into Connecticut.[9] On February 25, the University of New Haven suggested that all students in Italy should return to the United States.[10] A laboratory in Rocky Hill was approved by the United States Centers for Disease Control to test for COVID-19.[11] March 1\u20132: On March 1, two of Connecticut's neighbors, Rhode Island and New York, were confirmed to have COVID-19 cases.[12] On the same day, both the Connecticut state governor Ned Lamont and the United States Surgeon General spoke at a Connecticut Department of Public Health laboratory in Rocky Hill, which had been previously approved to test for the virus.[13] On March 2, two suspected cases of coronavirus in Connecticut were confirmed to be negative.[14] March 3\u20134: On March 3, Southern Connecticut State University suspended all institutionally-supported travel to nations including Italy, China, South Korea, and Japan to try to prevent the spread of the virus.[15] On March 4, it was revealed that a Meriden-based company had begun research on a vaccine to combat COVID-19.[16] March 5\u20136: On March 5, over 200 people in Connecticut were advised to self-monitor for symptoms.[17] On March 6, an employee at Danbury Hospital and Norwalk Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, marking the first confirmed coronavirus case that could be linked to Connecticut. However, the person infected lived in New York and quarantined in Westchester County, where she lived.[18] March 8: The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the state was reported in the town of Wilton.

Phase 1 allowed museums and zoos (outdoors only), offices, restaurants (outdoors only), retail and malls, outdoor recreation, and university research facilities to reopen.[32] June 1: Two of Connecticut's largest employers, Mohegan Sun Casino and Foxwoods Resort Casino, reopened. While Lamont publicly urged casinos to stay closed due to the sovereign nature of the tribal nations that own the casinos, they were able to open before similarly operated businesses in Connecticut.[33] The state started to erect electric signs on roads leading to the casinos to discourage people from going.[34] In addition, hair salons and barbershops were allowed to open.[32] June 17: Connecticut began Phase 2 of reopening. Types of facilities that were allowed to reopen include indoor dining, hotels, and gyms.[35] July 6: Governor Lamont indefinitely postponed the Phase 3 reopening scheduled for July 20, citing the surge in cases following other states reopening.

Indoor performing arts venues were reopened at 50% capacity while bars and nightclubs remained closed.[43] November 6: With the number of cases increasing, the Phase 3 reopening was scaled back to new \"Phase 2.1\" rules. Some of these rules included mandatory 10:00 PM closing times for restaurant dining, entertainment, recreational venues, and any other indoor or outdoor event.[44][45] The Connecticut State Department of Public Health advised a voluntary curfew from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM.[46][47] December 14: Following Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the first vaccinations with the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were administered to health care workers.[48] December 18: The first nursing home residents were vaccinated.[49] December 21: The first doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were administered.[50] January 4: Healthcare workers began receiving scheduled second vaccination doses for those who had already received one dose.[51] January 26: Governor Lamont ordered a second extension of the emergency declaration to last until April 20, 2021.[52][53] February 1: The mandatory closing time for dine-in restaurants was moved from 10 PM to 11 PM.

Viruses do not discriminate.\"[14] Governor Ned Lamont signed an executive order requiring the closure of all Connecticut public schools on March 17 until May 20; it was eventually extended for the rest of the school year. Most public schools were already closed.
