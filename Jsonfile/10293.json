{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Cameroon on 6 March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[2][3] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[4][5] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[6][4] Model-based simulations for Cameroon indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t has been stable around 1.0 since August 2020.[7]  Jack Ma donated medical supplies (20,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 1,000 medical-use protective suits and face shields) to Cameroon to assist the efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.[51] The supplies arrived at Cameroon's Yaounde Nsimalen Airport on 27 March 2020.[52] Samuel Eto'o gave 50,000 facial protection masks to taxi drivers in his country.[53] Vaccination started on 12 April 2021, initially with 200,000 doses of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine donated by China.[54] On 18 March, Cameroonian Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute closed its land, air and sea borders.[55] On 30 March, the Minister of Health announced the imminent launch of a coronavirus test campaign in the city of Douala. Dedicated teams will go door-to-door in the economic capital from April 2 to 6, says the minister.[56] On 7 April, the Cameroonian government has suspended calls for public generosity in the fight against COVID-19, a move that attracted criticism over political motives.[57] On 10 April, the government took 7 additional measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Cameroon. These measures take effect from Monday, 13 April 2020.[58] On April 15, following the claims of the Human Rights Commission of the Cameroon Bar Association, President Paul Biya announced the release of certain prisoners in connection with COVID-19.[59] On Tuesday May 5, the Minister of Health announced the provision to healthcare personnel of 50,000 coveralls, 320,000 surgical masks, 220 backpack sprayers, 10,000 pairs of overshoes.[21] In late June, the government announced that the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations would be postponed until 2022.[60]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10293","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Cameroon"}
