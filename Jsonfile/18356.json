{"Content: ":"The New Leave It to Beaver (also known as Still the Beaver) is an American sitcom sequel to the original 1957\u20131963 sitcom Leave It to Beaver. The series began with the 1983 reunion television movie Still the Beaver that aired on CBS in March 1983.[2][3] The success of the television movie prompted the creation of a revival series, also titled Still the Beaver, that aired on The Disney Channel from 1984 to 1985. In 1986, the series was picked up by TBS, where it aired until June 1989.[4][1] The series focuses on Wally Cleaver (Tony Dow) and his younger brother, Theodore \"Beaver\" Cleaver (Jerry Mathers) as adults and with families of their own. Beaver is divorced and living with his mother, the widowed June Cleaver (Barbara Billingsley), along with his two sons, Kip and Oliver. Wally Cleaver lives next door with his wife Mary Ellen, his daughter Kelly and later, his son Kevin. Hugh Beaumont, who played Ward Cleaver in the original series, had died in 1982, a year prior to the premiere of the telemovie. His character, Ward, died in 1977. The 1983 telemovie is dedicated in Beaumont's memory. Other series regulars included Wally's old friend Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond), his wife Gert (Ellen Maxted) and their sons Freddie and Bomber (played by Osmond's two real-life sons), as well as \"Lumpy\" Rutherford (Frank Bank) and his daughter J.J., with Diane Brewster returning for four episodes to recreate her role as \"Miss Canfield,\" Beaver's original grade school teacher. Some of Beaver's old friends, Larry Mondello (Rusty Stevens), and Richard Rickover (Rich Correll), return to the series. Still the Beaver, a two-hour CBS television movie, aired on March 18, 1983. In addition to the cast of the subsequent reboot series, the television movie featured: The original airing of the film easily won its Saturday night timeslot, and ranked 19th out of 66 programs airing that week, bringing in an 18.9 rating and a 33 share.[5][6] The first season, which aired on The Disney Channel, used the television movie\u2019s title, Still the Beaver, as the series title. When the series moved to TBS for season two, the television movie was repackaged into four 30-minute \"pilot\" episodes as part of the renamed The New Leave It to Beaver series. These were referred to as \"special episodes\" in an added voice-over by Barbara Billingsley and were known as: This season aired on The Disney Channel as Still the Beaver. The season was split into two halves, and could be considered as two separate seasons. Most of the episodes during the second half of the season, which begins with \"Escape from the Salt Mines\", aired during the summer and fall of 1985, which is technically within the span of the 1985-86 TV season. The episode \"Dear Pen Pal II\" was produced to be The Disney Channel's series finale and features only clips from Season One, but did not actually air until the third season on TBS. Kip announces that he\u2019s not spending Thanksgiving Day with the family. Kelly is nervous when she is cast in the title role of \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d; Wally and Beaver suspect that June may elope. Kelly\u2019s ruse to make her parents think she is a musical genius backfires when they arrange for her to take private piano lessons. Beaver and June convince Oliver to find his niche by participating in school activities. Oliver details his latest sibling spat in a letter to his pen pal in Africa. The Cleavers intervene when Freddie admits he has no date for the school dance. Despite prodding, Kelly is adamant about not taking swimming lessons. Wally blanches when Mary Ellen suggests he trade in his car; Kip and Freddie panic as they start their first day in high school. Beaver is thrilled when his childhood heartthrob returns to town, but her manners turn Oliver and Kip off. From this season onward, the show aired on TBS as The New Leave It to Beaver.","Title":"The New Leave It to Beaver - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18356","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Leave_It_to_Beaver"}
