King attended highschool and junior college before deciding that college was not right for him. Before co-creating Meow Wolf, he worked for a time as an art handler, landscaper and food delivery person.[2] King began his career as a painter, and when living in Texas he taught outdoor education to grade-school children in Dallas-Fort Worth, and had plans to open a summer camp. In addition to his work as a visual artist, King was also a multi-instrumentalist musician. He moved to Santa Fe in 2007. In 2008, he created his first immersive artwork, Meowzors, with others in the art collective.[7][8] King has been described as a \"self-educated philosopher who studies hermeticism and wanted to bring people together with his art.\"[2] King was part of collaborative team of artists that launched Meow Wolf in 2008.[3] He developed or co-developed 34 Meow Wolf projects including House of Eternal Return in Santa Fe and Omega Mart in Las Vegas,[7] as well as being the lead artist on The Cathedral at Meow Wolf Denver.[3][9] He was a lead artist on many interactive artworks including the Laser Harp installation and the Fancy Town at the House of Eternal Return.[9] The Fancy Town installation doubles as an event venue, and has the appearance of an Old West ghost town made of recycled scrap wood and construction waste. King described it as \u201cTurning your capitalistic trash into freedom of expression.\u201d King constructed the surrounding walls to have the appearance of old storefronts.[10] King participated in the first meeting of the Meow Wolf art collective in 2008. During the early years, King and his collaborators created surreal and futuristic immersive art environments, and hosted music shows and events. By 2022, the company had grown to 980 employees, with a revenue of $158 million, and had served more than 1.5 million visitors.
