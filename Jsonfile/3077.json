At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[21] Gomez has said, \"I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas].\"[22] She later added that her mother \"was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me.\" Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they \"raised her\" until she found success in show business.[23] Gomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[24] She began auditioning for various roles and met Demi Lovato during an audition for Barney & Friends.[25][26] Both Gomez and Lovato were later selected to appear on the series in 2002,[27][28] with Gomez portraying the character Gianna.[29] The show was her first acting gig.
