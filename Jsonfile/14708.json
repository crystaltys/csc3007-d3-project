{"Content: ":"The president of the Republic of South Ossetia (Ossetian: Хуссар Ирыстоны президент, Russian: Президент Южной Осетии) is the de facto head of state of the partially recognized Republic of South Ossetia that is de jure part of Georgia. This is a list of the de facto presidents of the Republic of South Ossetia and the holders of the precursor to the office. On April 10, 2022, incumbent President Anatoly Bibilov lost the first round of the presidential election to Alan Gagloyev, who received most votes.[1][2] As none of the candidates received more than 50% of the vote, a requirement to win the presidency, a second round was called between Bibilov and Gagloyev. The three eliminated candidates declared their support for Gagloyev for the second round, which was scheduled for May 8, 2022, after initial confusion over its date.[3] Gagloyev won this round with 56.2% of the vote. The Election Commission set the transfer of power on May 24, 2022.[4] According to local experts, Bibilov's defeat after an easy victory in 2017 can be explained by the number of scandals and abuse of power accusations that took place in recent years. There was for example the scandal of the prison death, which caused civil unrest and a paralyzed parliament.[5]   This South Ossetia-related article is a stub.
