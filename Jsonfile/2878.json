{"Content: ":"The Fresno Bee is a daily newspaper serving Fresno, California, and surrounding counties in that U.S. state's central San Joaquin Valley. It is owned by The McClatchy Company and ranks fourth in circulation among the company's newspapers. It is headquartered in the historic Fresno Bee Building. The Fresno Bee was founded in 1922 by the McClatchy brothers Charles Kenny (C. K.) and Valentine Stuart (V. S.), sons of The Sacramento Bee's second editor James McClatchy.[3] C. K.'s only son Carlos McClatchy became The Fresno Bee's first editor.[4] The two Central Valley newspapers, closely linked by family ownership and editorial philosophy, formed the core of what later grew into The McClatchy Company. In 1926, the McClatchys purchased an older Fresno newspaper, The Republican. The Fresno Republican had been founded in 1876, by Dr. Chester A. Rowell and a group of investors that included inventor and entrepreneur Frank Dusy. In 1932, The Fresno Bee took over the subscription lists of The Fresno Republican and merged the newspapers. The Fresno Bee began publishing the Spanish newspaper Vida en el Valle in 1990. The paper launched its website in 1996; in November 2005, the paper integrated its online operations into the paper's other departments.[5] In 2004, The Fresno Bee purchased the Sierra Star in Oakhurst.[6] Since 2017, the paper's relationship with their hometown representative Devin Nunes has deteriorated. Nunes took issue with several op-eds the paper had published on his handling of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.[7] Nunes responded by airing TV ads attacking the paper[7] and mailing constituents a 40-page glossy pamphlet solely focused on attacking The Bee's reputation.[8]  This article about a California newspaper is a stub.
