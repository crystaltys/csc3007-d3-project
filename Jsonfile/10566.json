The virus was confirmed to have reached Diego Garcia of the British Indian Ocean Territory in November 2020.[1][2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] From 19 March 2020, Public Health England no longer classified COVID-19 as a \"High consequence infectious disease\".[6] In November 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at Diego Garcia.[1] In December 2020, the second case, a close contact of the first case, was confirmed.[1] In May 2021, three more cases were confirmed from a flight.
