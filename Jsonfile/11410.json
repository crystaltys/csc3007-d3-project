{"Content: ":"Ashley Robin Bloomfield[1] (born 1965/1966) is a New Zealand public health official. He is the chief executive of the Ministry of Health and the country's Director-General of Health. He has been the public-facing health specialist liaising with the media during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand on behalf of the government, since the first press conference on 27 January 2020. He will step down from his role at the Ministry of Health at the end of July 2022. Bloomfield was born in Napier[2] in 1965 or 1966, one of three children of Allan Olaf Bloomfield and Myreine Alice Bloomfield (née Osborne).[3][4][5] His mother was a schoolteacher, while his father was a lieutenant colonel in the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (Territorial Force) and a manager at Mitsubishi Motors in Porirua, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1974 New Year Honours.[3][4][6] Bloomfield grew up in Tawa, a suburb of Wellington, and was educated at Scots College, where he was head prefect,[3] dux, played 1st XV rugby[7] and was a member of the cast of the college's production of Oklahoma![8] Bloomfield graduated Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery from the University of Auckland in 1990.[1][3] About the same time, he married his wife, Libby, also a doctor, and the couple went on to have three children.[3] Bloomfield completed several years of clinical work and from 1996[9] specialised in public health medicine,[10] concentrating on non-communicable diseases.[11][12] In 1997, he graduated from the University of Auckland with a Master of Public Health degree, with first-class honours.[13] Between 2004 and 2006, Bloomfield was the Ministry of Health's acting director of public health.[14][15] From 2006 to 2010, he was the ministry's chief public health adviser.[9] From late 2010 to late 2011, based at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Bloomfield worked on non-communicable disease prevention and control with a global focus.[11] From 2012 to 2015, he held leading positions across district health boards with Capital & Coast District, Hutt Valley, and Wairarapa. From 2015 to 2018, Bloomfield was chief executive at Hutt Valley District Health Board.[16] In the first half of 2018, Bloomfield was seconded to the Capital & Coast District Health Board where he was interim chief executive. Since 11 June 2018, he has been the chief executive of the country's Ministry of Health and the country's Director-General of Health.[1][3][11] Since he started as the ministry's Chief Executive he has attended a leadership programme at Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford.[9] Colleagues describe Bloomfield as \"measured, methodical, calm and sensible\".[9] Former health reporter Tess Nichol, writing for the American online magazine Slate, described him as \"New Zealand\u2019s current obsession, an unlikely heartthrob, a mild-mannered health care hero\".[17] Former prime minister, Geoffrey Palmer, remarked about Bloomfield: \"It is a long time since a public servant has become so well-known.\"[18] Perhaps in part due to the relative effectiveness of the COVID-19 measures taken by the New Zealand Government, Bloomfield has developed a cult following.[19] Facebook pages and merchandise have been created celebrating Bloomfield, and at least one person has had his image tattooed on their body.[20][21][22] When Bloomfield played for an invitational Centurions side in their 2020 rugby match against the Parliamentary team, children took placards to the game to support him. Bloomfield chose the nickname \"The Eliminator\" for the match, in which he opened the scoring with the first try.[23][24][25] In November 2020, Bloomfield was named one of the best-dressed men on David Hartnell's best-dressed list.[26] In August 2021, Bloomfield apologised to the New Zealand Parliament's health select committee for providing them with incorrect information about a United Nations worker from Fiji who later tested positive for COVID-19.[27] In early April 2022, Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes announced that Bloomfield would step down as Director-General of Health on 29 July 2022.[28]","Title":"Ashley Bloomfield - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11410","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Bloomfield"}
