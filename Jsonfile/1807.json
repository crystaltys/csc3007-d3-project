{"Content: ":"The navel (clinically known as the umbilicus, commonly known as the belly button) is a protruding, flat, or hollowed area on the abdomen at the attachment site of the umbilical cord.[1] All placental mammals have a navel. The umbilicus is used to visually separate the abdomen into quadrants.[2] The umbilicus is a prominent scar on the abdomen, with its position being relatively consistent among humans. The skin around the waist at the level of the umbilicus is supplied by the tenth thoracic spinal nerve (T10 dermatome). The umbilicus itself typically lies at a vertical level corresponding to the junction between the L3 and L4 vertebrae,[3] with a normal variation among people between the L3 and L5 vertebrae.[4] Parts of the adult navel include the \"umbilical cord remnant\" or \"umbilical tip\", which is the often protruding scar left by the detachment of the umbilical cord. This is located in the center of the navel, sometimes described as the belly button. Around the cord remnant, is the \"umbilical collar\", formed by the dense fibrous umbilical ring. Surrounding the umbilical collar is the periumbilical skin. Directly behind the navel is a thick fibrous cord formed from the umbilical cord, called the urachus, which originates from the bladder.[5] The navel is unique to each individual due to its being a scar, and various general forms have been classified by medical practitioners.[6][7][further explanation needed] Both Carlson twins have swirly navels A t-shaped navel One of many variations of an outie An innie navel Closeup of a female navel Outies are sometimes mistaken for umbilical hernias; however, they are a completely different shape with no health concern, unlike an umbilical hernia. The navel (specifically abdominal wall) would be considered an umbilical hernia if the protrusion were 5 centimeters or more. The diameter of an umbilical hernia is usually 1/2-inch or more.[9] Navels that are concave are nicknamed \"innies\".[10] While the shape of the human navel may be affected by longterm changes to diet and exercise, unexpected change in shape may be the result of ascites.[11] In addition to change in shape being a possible side effect from ascites and umbilical hernias, the navel can be involved in umbilical sinus or fistula, which in rare cases can lead to menstrual or fecal discharge from the navel. Menstrual discharge from the umbilicus is a rare disorder associated with umbilical endometriosis.[12][13] To minimize scarring, the navel is a recommended site of incision for various surgeries, including transgastric appendicectomy,[16] gall bladder surgery,[17] and the umbilicoplasty[18] procedure itself. The public exposure of the male and female midriff and bare navel was considered taboo at times in the past in Western cultures, being considered immodest or indecent. Female navel exposure was banned in some jurisdictions, but community perceptions have changed to this now being acceptable.[19] The crop top is a shirt that often exposes the belly button and has become more common among young men and women.[20] Exposure of the male navel has rarely been stigmatised and has become particularly popular in recent years, due to the strong resurgence of the male crop top and male navel piercing.[21] The navel and midriff are often also displayed in bikinis, or when low-rise pants are worn. While the West was relatively resistant to navel-baring clothing until the 1980s, it has long been a fashion with Indian women,[22] often displayed with Saris or Lehengas. The Japanese have long had a special regard for the navel. During the early Jōmon period in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolized the center where life began.[23] In Arabic-Levantine culture, belly dancing is a popular art form that consists of dance movements focused on the torso and navel.[24] Buddhism and Hinduism refer to the chakra of the navel as the manipura. In qigong, the navel is seen as the main energy centre, or dantian. In Hinduism, the Kundalini energy is sometimes described as being located at the navel.
