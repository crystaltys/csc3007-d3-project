{"Content: ":"One-day races and Classics Jasper Philipsen (born 2 March 1998) is a Belgian professional cyclist, who currently rides for UCI ProTeam Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck.[5][6] In July 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Tour de France.[7] In October 2020, he was named in the startlist for the 2020 Vuelta a España,[8] where he won stage 15. He participated in his second Tour de France in 2021 and while he did not win any stages he had many promising results including finishing on the stage podium a half dozen times. He rode in the 2021 Vuelta a España where he won two stages.[9] He also wore the points classification jersey on several stages, being involved in a battle with Fabio Jakobsen for the jersey, before he decided it had been a successful race and chose to abandon about halfway through due to a mild fever.[10] Early in the 2022 season he won the points classification and two stages of the UAE Tour. He then won the points classification and a stage in the Tour of Turkey and a stage in the Tour of Belgium. He entered the 2022 Tour de France with the team targeting stage wins with both Philipsen and Matthew van der Poel. Philipsen initially thought that he won stage 4, but it turned out Wout Van Aert had surprised the peloton and attacked while wearing the yellow jersey. After the Alps he got a chance to win stage 15 after the final breakaway rider had been caught inside the final kilometre. He was able to outcharge previous stage winners Van Aert and Mads Pedersen to take the team's first win of the race.[11] After the stage Tadej Pogačar came over to the private team area away from the press and crowds to congratulate him on his first career Tour win. His second stage win came on the final day in Paris where he convincingly out-sprinted the others fighting for the stage win.
