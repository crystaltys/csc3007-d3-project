The history of the site Tomblaine dates back to at least 500 BC in Gallo-Roman times. In the seventeenth century, wars and famines spread across Tomblaine. This resulted in a large decrease in population which has since risen. In 1770, the castle within the town belonged to Prince Louis XVI, the future King of France.
