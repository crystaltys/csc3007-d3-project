{"Content: ":"Around 129 species of birds have become extinct since 1500,[1] and the rate of extinction seems to be increasing.[2] The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived.[citation needed] Other areas, such as Guam, have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced brown tree snake.[citation needed] Currently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.[citation needed] Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The disproportionate number of rails in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species. The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the San Benedicto rock wren is possibly the most extreme example\u2014its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists. Ducks, geese and swans Quails and relatives See also Bokaak \"bustard\" under Gruiformes below Shorebirds, gulls and auks Rails and allies - probably paraphyletic Grebes Pelicans and related birds Boobies and related birds Petrels, shearwaters, albatrosses and storm petrels. Penguins Pigeons, doves and dodos For the \"Réunion solitaire\", see Réunion ibis. Parrots Cuckoos Birds of prey Typical owls and barn owls. Caprimulgidae - nightjars and nighthawks Reclusive ground-nesting birds that sally out at night to hunt for large insects and similar prey. They are easily located by the males' song, but this is not given all year. Habitat destruction represents currently the biggest threat, while island populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators, notably dogs, cats, pigs and mongooses.

National and international conservation projects and research publications such as redlists usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of threatened subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations, such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of taxa that may still exist, but are listed here due to any combination of absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, or an observed decline.
