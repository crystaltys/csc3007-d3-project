{"Content: ":"This article contains statistics about the COVID-19 pandemic in India. COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and other statistics are shown in nationwide and regional maps and graphs. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) governs classification of a COVID-19 related death in India. ICMR in turn follows WHO guidelines, recording COVID-19 deaths as U07.1 as per International Classification of Diseases.[1] The National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research, ICMR, released a document titled \"Guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India\".[2] In March 2020, the first two COVID-19 infected people to die in India officially died due to their co-morbidities and not COVID-19.[3] Around India, people dying of their co-morbidities are not be considered as a COVID-19 death, \"if a comorbid patient dies then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of death [...] If that committee identifies the main cause of death as heart attack, then even if the patient was infected, such a death is not counted as being caused by Covid.\"[4] Testing of dead bodies to COVID-19 is being done according to ICMR guidelines and government orders.[5][6] On 17 May 2020, the Delhi government changed COVID-19 testing policy by stopping tests of dead bodies.[7] India's first national serological (seroprevalence) survey was conducted by ICMR during May\u2013June 2020; 0.73% sero-positivity was observed. The results were published on 10 September 2021 on the website of the Indian Journal of Medical Research.[8] However the survey and subsequent press releases and the final publication saw a number of discrepancies.[8][9] ICMR also clarified that the observed sero-positivity did not represent the entire population.[8] While ICMR came out with a 49% sero-positivity rate for Ahmedabad, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation conducted its own survey and came out with an average sero-positivity of 17.61%.[8] The second serological survey, published in The Lancet,[10] was conducted in August\u2013September 2020; 6.6% sero-positivity was observed, i.e. for every case detected, about 15 went undetected.[9] India's third national serological survey conducted in December 2020 and January 2021 revealed that only 3.5% of the total infections had been \"detected\" or \"recorded\".[9] In other words, for every case detected, about 30 went undetected.[11] Reconciled and backlogged data includes both deaths and number of tests.[12] States and union territories that have reconciled deaths include Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Goa and Delhi.[12] 7.6 million tests have been reconciled.[12] Until 21 July 2021, Maharashtra had reconciled deaths 14 times.[13] Total Confirmed cases by state and union territory Confirmed cases per million population by state and union territory Active cases by state and union territory Deaths per million population by state and union territory Deaths by state and union territory Recoveries per million population by state and union territory      Total confirmed cases Active cases Recoveries Deaths New cases per day 7-day moving average of new cases per day New deaths per day 7-day moving average of new deaths per day New recoveries per day New cases as percentage of active cases 7-day moving average of new cases as percentage of active cases 7-day moving CAGR of active cases The trend of case fatality rate for COVID-19 from 12 March, the day first death in the country was recorded.[18] Case fatality rate  Daily positive sampling ratio Total positive sampling ratio Graph sources: Data from MoHFW and ICMR According to the World Health Organization the global mortality excess for COVID-19 is significant, \"while 1,813,188 COVID-19 deaths were reported in 2020... WHO estimates suggest an excess mortality of at least 3,000,000.\"[19] The worldwide average for underreporting COVID-19 deaths in cities is 30%.[20] In India the accuracy of counting its dead is further complicated by its system of tracking deaths in its population in general. In 2018, about 86%% of the deaths in the country were are registered while medical certificates are given to around 22% of the deaths. Recently released reports by the Civil Registration suggest that death registration has improved further in 2019.[21] Still, there are inaccuracies in the medical certificates.[7] Death registration also varies. In 2019 the National Family Health Survey registration of deaths varied from 37% (Bihar) to 100% (Goa).[22] India's low death count has puzzled experts such as microbiologist Gagandeep Kang and epidemiologist Prabhat Jha.[20] Epidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan points to India's relatively young population and uneven disease surveillance as reasons for the low death count.[20] Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, points to genetics and air pollution in India as a factor for the low death count.[20] In April 2021 the Gujarat High Court and the Telangana High Court both commented on the need of states to provide accurate data with respect to the pandemic.[23][24] In May 2021, Prime Minister Modi made a comment related to death counts, \"states should be encouraged to report their numbers transparently without any pressure of high numbers showing adversely on their efforts\".[25] Undercounting of cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic in India is not unique to the country.[26][19] Journalists,[27] mathematicians,[11] epidemiologists,[28] statisticians, and scientists have attempted,[29] according to their expertise, to arrive at a truer number of the actual cases and deaths. The aim of this is to ultimately improve national and international responses to the pandemic.[30][31][32] Journalists have spent time at burial-grounds and crematoriums and counted in-person the number of burials and cremations. These manual counts have been compared to government figures and have been found significantly different.[27][1] India's national serological surveys also point to large numbers (ratios of one is to thirty) of cases remaining undetected.[9][11] The scale of under-reporting from one place to another can be very large.[31] The undercounting may or may not be intentional. Rather undercounting may occur due to unreported COVID-19 cases, inefficiencies in the data collection system, inability to adapt to pandemic like situation and people not reporting deaths.[1][33][34] Following reports of under-counting in May 2021, ThePrint published figures that the Delhi government may have started over-counting. Irrespective of either, the accuracy of government figures, irrespective of high or low counts, is brought to question.[48] ","Title":"Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in India - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10383","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_India"}
