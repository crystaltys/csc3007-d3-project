{"Content: ":"The Eurovision Song Contest 1980 was the 25th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in The Hague, Netherlands, and was organised by host broadcaster Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) \u2013 which agreed to stage the event after Israel, having won in both 1978 and 1979, declined to host it for a second successive year \u2013 and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The contest was held at the Nederlands Congresgebouw on 19 April 1980 and was hosted by Dutch actress Marlous Fluitsma, although each song was introduced by a presenter from the participating nation (in some cases, this was the same person providing the commentary). Nineteen countries took part this year, with Monaco and the previous year's winner Israel deciding not to participate, and Turkey returning. Morocco, notably, made its only appearance in the contest. The winner was Ireland with the song \"What's Another Year\", sung by Johnny Logan and written by Shay Healy.[1][2] Israel, the winner of the 1979 contest, declined to host it for the second time in a row, as the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) could not fund another international production without extra resources, and the Israeli government turned down a request to extend the IBA budget. The EBU also scheduled the broadcast for the same day as the Yom HaZikaron holiday, which meant that Israel could not even participate at all, marking the only time that the previous year's winning country did not compete the following year. After Spain \u2013 the second-placed country of 1979 \u2013 and (reportedly) the United Kingdom both declined to host, the Netherlands ultimately agreed to host the show in a small-scale production. According to Yair Lapid, son of Tommy Lapid who was then the IBA director general, Lapid called his counterpart at NOS and convinced him to take the \"undesired honour\", when he realised that the extra cost could paralyse the regular work of the IBA.[3] The contest took place in The Hague at the Congresgebouw (presently known as the World Forum). The venue was constructed in 1969 and had previously hosted the contest in 1976. The venue that had hosted the 1976 contest, the Congresgebouw, was again chosen to stage the contest. Various parts of the opening sequence and stage of the 1976 festival were reused. Again, Roland de Groot took charge of the design. As with the 1977 and 1978 contests, there were no pre-filmed postcards between the songs, with a guest presenter from each nation introducing the entries. Apart from this, the presenter, Marlous Fluitsma, except for the voting, did not make the presentation in English or French, which means that the presentation was made almost entirely in Dutch. NOS spent just US$725,000 on staging the show. During the live interval act performance of San Fernando by The Dutch Rhythm Steel and Show Band with the Lee Jackson dancers, Hans van Willigenburg intercut brief interviews with some of the participants backstage in the green room, speaking to the singers from Germany, Luxembourg, the UK, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands, each in their own language. Australian-born Johnny Logan, representing Ireland, was ultimately crowned the winner with the song \"What's Another Year\". This was Ireland's second victory in the competition, having previously won in 1970 with \"All Kinds of Everything\", coincidentally also held on Dutch soil. It was also the first time that a male solo artist (albeit with backing vocals) had won the contest since Udo JÃ¼rgens won for Austria in 1966. Germany were the runner-up for this year. They would finish in second place again the following year, before finally winning in 1982. Germany would go on to finish second again in 1985 and 1987, making the 1980s their most successful decade in the contest. After relatively poor placings in the two previous years, the United Kingdom returned to form by coming third. Each song was introduced by a presenter from the national country.[4] A few countries used their commentators as presenters, with Turkey's radio commentator and the TV commentators of Denmark, Sweden and Finland being employed in this role. With the exception of the Ireland entry, which was introduced in Irish, all the introductions were made in the language in which the song was performed. The UK presenter was incorrectly identified in the onscreen caption as 'Noel Edmunds' and the Finnish presenter as 'Heikki Haarma'. After Israel announced its non-participation, Morocco entered into the contest instead. Monaco also withdrew from the contest, and would not return until 2004. With the exception of Belgium, each performance had a conductor who directed the orchestra.[5][4] This was the only contest to feature a Black conductor conducting an entry, that being Italy's conductor Del Newman. The scoring system implemented in 1975 remained the same; each country had a jury who awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) for their top ten songs. However this year for the first time, countries were required to declare their scores in ascending order, 1,2,3 etc. This change made for the added excitement of waiting for each country to award their highest 12 points at the end of each voting round. For the voting sequence, Marlous Fluitsma used a unique telephone to speak to the nineteen jury spokespersons, although the phones were simply props and were not connected. Below is a summary of all 12 points in the final: Listed below is the order in which votes were cast during the 1980 contest along with the spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for their respective country. Each national broadcaster also sent a commentator to the contest, in order to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language.","Title":"Eurovision Song Contest 1980 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7174","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1980"}
