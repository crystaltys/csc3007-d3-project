{"Content: ":"One-day races and Classics Odile Defraye (pronounced [ɔ.dil dɛ.fʁɛj]; Dutch: Odiel Defraeye; 14 July 1888 \u2013 21 August 1965) was a Belgian road racing cyclist who won three stages and the overall title of the 1912 Tour de France, which was the last tour decided by a points system instead of overall best time.[1] He was the first Belgian to win the Tour and was only invited to join Alcyon's all-French team at a late stage for publicity purposes. In the 1913 Tour de France, Defraye held the overall lead after stages 2 through 5 before relinquishing the lead on the Tourmalet to Stage 6 and eventual winner Philippe Thys. He participated in six tours between 1909 and 1924 but his victory Tour was the only one that he completed.[2] Other major wins include the 1913 Milan\u2013San Remo, a one-day classic, and four stages and the overall for the 1912 Tour of Belgium.","Title":"Odile Defraye - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8243","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odile_Defraye"}
