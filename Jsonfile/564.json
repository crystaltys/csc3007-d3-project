{"Content: ":"Lingyuanopterus (IPA: [lɪŋüenɔptərʌs], meaning Lingyuan wing) is a genus of istiodactylid pterosaur from the Aptian age Jiufotang Formation in western Liaoning, China. The type and only species is L. camposi, known from the holotype specimen IVPP V 17940 a near complete skull, mandible and atlas-axis complex.[1] Lingyuanopterus was named and described in 2022 by Xu et al., (2022). The type species is L. camposi. The generic name is derived from the locality in which the holotype specimen was found 'Lingyuan' (IPA: [lɪŋüens]) and the Latinized Greek noun 'pterus' (IPA: [ptərʌs]), meaning 'wing'. The specific name 'camposi' (IPA: [cɑːmpɔːsaɪ]) honours Brazilian vertebrate paleontologist Diogenes de Almeida Campos for his contribution to China-Brazil pterosaur collaborative research.[1] Lingyuanopterus is only known from the holotype IVPP V 17940, which consists of a nearly complete skull, a nearly complete mandible, and an atlas-axis complex. The skull is 306.8 millimetres (12.08 in) long measured from the anterior tip of the premaxilla to the posterior margin of the squamosal, and 51.1 millimetres (2.01 in) high measured from the highest point of the skull (above the anterior region of the frontal) to the jaw line. The nasoantorbital fenestra has a length of 149.3 millimetres (5.88 in) at the ventral margin, occupying around 48.7% of the skull length. The dorsal margin of the skull is smooth and slightly curved, with no parietal crest/sagittal crest. The rostrum is slightly deflected dorsally, with its anterior end thicker at the ventral margin. The length of the skull anterior to the jaw articulation is 236.9 millimetres (9.33 in). The bones on the right side of the skull are ventrally displaced due to its preservation.[1] In Xu et al., (2022) Lingyuanopterus is recovered as an istiodactylid pterosaur.[1] Cladogram after Xu et al., (2022): Lonchodectidae Mimodactylidae Hongshanopterus Nurhachius Lingyuanopterus Luchibang Istiodactylinae Xu et al., (2022) suggest that Lingyuanopterus was adapted for scavenging, citing several features including the well-interlocked labiolingually compressed teeth, slender maxillae, shallow rostra and mandibular symphyses and long retroarticular processes.[1]   ","Title":"Lingyuanopterus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"564","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingyuanopterus"}
