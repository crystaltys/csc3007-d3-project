{"Content: ":"PeduliLindungi (roughly translated from Indonesian as \"care to protect\") is the official COVID-19 contact tracing app used for digital contact tracing in Indonesia. This application is developed by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kemenkominfo), in partnership with Committee for COVID-19 Response and National Economic Recovery (KPCPEN), Ministry of Health (Kemenkes), Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (KemenBUMN), and Telkom Indonesia.[1] This app was formerly known as TraceTogether but later changed because Singapore had its app using the same name.[2] On 23 August 2021, Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investments Affairs, Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, encouraged the government to make this app a mandatory requirement before using public transportations, such as train, bus, ferry, and plane.[3] Furthermore, citizen must have installed the app before entering shopping malls, factories, and sport venues.[4] Every person who have received at least a dose of vaccine will receive a vaccine card and vaccination certificate which can be downloaded from the app.[5] It was reported that the app requires access to the phone's files & media and GPS at all time, which quickly drains the battery. Giving location access only during use or no access will make the app unusable. This is in stark contrast to other country's COVID-19 apps which only use Bluetooth and do not require any additional permissions.[6][7] Despite being mandatory for public transport & entering malls, it has not been accommodating for foreigners, as the app is only in Indonesian and requires a residency card (NIK) to sign up.[7] In September 2021, stored personal data of at least 1.3 million Indonesian residents were leaked online, including the vaccine certificate of President Joko Widodo. The data leak was also reported on eHAC (electronic Health Alert Card), a mandatory app used for air passengers.[8] This mobile software article is a stub.
