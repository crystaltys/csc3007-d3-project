Just a friendly reminder. Don't let anybody get between you and your family.\"[184] On March 21, 2017, the dispute was settled out of court.[185][186] Corley and Bennett reconciled, and on July 4, 2018, they became engaged after 5 years together.[187] The two married on March 9, 2019, at the Pelican Hill Resort in Newport Beach, California with guests including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.[188][189] Bennett spends much of his free time with his daughter, and frequently takes her on outings.
