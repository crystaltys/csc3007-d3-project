{"Content: ":"Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport (German: Flugplatz Frankfurt-Egelsbach) (ICAO: EDFE) is a general aviation airport located near Egelsbach, a town in the German state of Hesse. It is located 10 km (6 mi) southeast of Frankfurt Airport. The airport was opened in 1955 with a single grass runway. It proved popular, and by 1957 was already seeing 37,000 movements a year. Because of this, in 1966, an asphalt runway was constructed and by 1977 the number of movements had increased to 126,000 a year. In 2007, about 77,000 movements were made, making it the busiest airport for general aviation in Germany. To allow for larger aircraft to land, in 2004 construction was started on a runway expansion, which increased the runway length to its current 1,400 m (1,500 yd). In May 2009, NetJets Europe announced that they intended to purchase the airport. Today NetJets owns 80% of the aerodrome (the other 20% being owned by local communities) and intends to establish IFR procedures at the airport, including an ILS approach. There are also plans to extend the runway by another 270 m (300 yd) and to increase the width by 5 m (16 ft).[2] The airport resides at an elevation of 385 feet (117 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways, both in the 08/26 direction (though no left (L) or right (R) markings or indicators are used): a 1,400 by 25 metres (4,593 ft × 82 ft) asphalt runway and a 670 by 30 metres (2,198 ft × 98 ft) grass runway. There are no scheduled services to and from Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport.
