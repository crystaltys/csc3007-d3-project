{"Content: ":"The Communist Party of the Donetsk People's Republic (abbr. CPDPR; Russian: Коммунистическая партия Донецкой Народной Республики; КПДНР, romanized: Kommunisticheskaya partiya Donetskoy Narodnoy Respubliki, KPDNR) is a communist party in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, led by Boris Litvinov, formerly the chairman of the People's Council of the Donetsk People's Republic.[2] It was a faction of the Donetsk Republic organization from 2014 to 2016. The CPDPR was founded on 8 October 2014. Boris Litvinov, who previously was the head of a regional branch of the Communist Party of Ukraine in the Kirovsky District, Donetsk,[failed verification][3][4] was proclaimed chairman of the party. Litvinov headed the People's Council from July to October 2014.[4] After his dismissal as chairman of the People's Council, rumors emerged that Litvinov had been briefly arrested, yet Litvnov himself denied them.[4] Litvinov stated that the CPDPR would support the candidacy of Alexander Zakharchenko, the first President of the Donetsk People's Republic, in the 2014 general election for the country's premiership.[2] The CPDPR themselves were banned from participating in the elections because the party \"made too many mistakes\" in their submitted documents.[5] According to some Russian media, the final party's lists were edited in Moscow.[4] Selected members were allowed to be on the party list for the Donetsk Republic political organization.[4] Three members of the CPDPR were elected to the People's Council: Boris Litvinov, Vadim Zaibert, and Nikolai Ragozin.[4] Zaibert was later killed in action and not replaced, thus leaving only two members of the party in the People's Council.[6] In 2016 Litvinov and Ragozin were expelled from the People's Council due to a \"loss of confidence\", thus leaving the party with no representatives.[4] The party's program is fully copied and is identical with the party's program of the Communist Party of Ukraine.[failed verification][7]","Title":"Communist Party of the Donetsk People's Republic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16528","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Donetsk_People%27s_Republic"}
