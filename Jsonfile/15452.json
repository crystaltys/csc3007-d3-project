{"Content: ":"The 2020s (shortened to \"the '20s\" and referred to as the twenties)[1][2] is the current decade which began on 1 January 2020, and will end on 31 December 2029. The 2020s began with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a global economic recession as well as continuing financial inflation concerns and a global supply chain crisis. International demonstrations occurred in the early 2020s, including a continuation of those in Hong Kong that started in the late 2010s against extradition legislation, protests against certain local, state and national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and others around the world against racism and police brutality. The private space race also greatly accelerated in the early 2020s, as did military conflicts such as the Azerbaijan-Armenian War, the Tigray War, the conflict between Gaza and Israel, the Fall of Kabul (which marked the end of the 20-year War in Afghanistan) and the Russian invasion of Ukraine (the largest conventional military offensive in Europe since World War II having resulted in an immense refugee crisis). With many extreme weather events worsening in the early 2020s, several world leaders have called it the \"decisive decade\" for climate action as ecological crises continue to escalate.[3][4] 5G networks also launched around the globe at the start of the decade, and became prevalent in smartphones. The prominent wars of the decade include: Note: To be included, entries must be notable (have a stand-alone article) and described by a consensus of reliable sources as \"terrorism\". They also must have 100 or more fatalities reported. Having suffered decline in the years after the Great Recession, the centre-left politics and the 1990s political model (like progressivism, liberalism, social democracy, and third way policies) experienced a resurgence across Europe and the Anglosphere in the early 2020s, various factors were suggested as contributing to this including natural shifts in the electoral cycle along with conservatives difficulties appealing to university graduates or voters under the age of 40.[32] Sitting leaders that died in office: In 2020: Sheik Sabah al-Sabah, Sultan Qaboos bin Said,[33] and Pierre Nkurunziza.

The event has been condemned by foreign governments, the political opposition, and human rights organizations and is considered the first major political crisis in the country since the conclusion of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992 and has been referred to as a coup attempt. Prominent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include: Note: This table is a chronological list of earthquakes reported with 7.5Mw\u202f or greater or that have reported at least 100 fatalities. Note: This section reports only floods with 200 or more deaths and avalanches and landslides involving 30 or more deaths. In 2020, a huge swarm of desert locusts threatened to engulf massive portions of the Middle East, Africa and Asia.[105][106][107][108][109][110] The World Trade Organization reported that trade growth had stagnated and that trade restrictions were increasing as the decade began. The sectors most affected by import restrictions were mineral and fuel oils (17.7%), machinery and mechanical appliances (13%), electrical machinery and parts (11.7%), and precious metals (6%).[117] Regional trade agreements were found to be increasing.[118] Archaeology: 2020 2021 Paleontology: 2020 2021 Space: 2020 2021 Spaceflight: 2020 2021 Biotechnology: 2020 2021 Quantum IT: 2020 2021 Computing: 2020s Environment and environmental sciences: 2020 2021 Climate change: 2020 2021 Philosophy: 2020 2021 History of technology by type List of science timelines Medical experts advised, and local authorities often mandated stay-at-home orders to prevent gatherings of any size. Such gatherings could be replaced by teleconferencing, or in some cases with unconventional attempts to maintain social distancing with activities such as a balcony sing-along for a concert, or a \"birthday parade\" for a birthday party. Replacements for gatherings were seen as significant to mental health during the crisis. Social isolation among alcohol users also adopted a trend towards Kalsarikänni or \"pantsdrunking\", a Finnish antisocial drinking culture. Low-income individuals were more likely to contract the coronavirus and to die from it. In both New York City and Barcelona, low-income neighborhoods were disproportionately hit by coronavirus cases. Hypotheses for why this was the case included that poorer families were more likely to live in crowded housing and work in low-skill jobs, such as supermarkets and elder care, which were deemed essential during the crisis. In the United States, millions of low-income people may lack access to health care due to being uninsured or underinsured. Millions of Americans lost their health insurance after losing their jobs. Many low-income workers in service jobs became unemployed. The coronavirus pandemic was followed by a concern for a potential spike in suicides, exacerbated by social isolation due to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and unemployment and financial factors. Many countries reported an increase in domestic violence and intimate partner violence attributed to lockdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial insecurity, stress, and uncertainty led to increased aggression at home, with abusers able to control large amounts of their victims' daily life. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for a domestic violence \"ceasefire\". The murder of George Floyd led to many protest and riots across the United States and internationally in 2020. The stated goal of the protest has been to end police brutality and racial inequality and is closely linked with the Black Lives Matter movement. 24.3% of all national parliamentarians were women as of February 2019. 11 women were serving as Head of State and 12 as Head of Government in June 2019. 20.7% of government ministers were women as of January 2019.

Doja Cat, a fashion icon of the early part of the decade, became one of the most streamed artists on Spotify in 2021, along with musicians like Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa and others. COVID-19 vaccines became widely available to the public in some countries starting in 2021, and influenced certain cultures based on the vaccine status of individuals. Fashion trends of the early 2020s have been largely inspired by the 2000s.[143][144][145] Wearing a decorative mask to prevent the disease COVID-19 from spreading was a fashion trend in the early 2020s.[146] Spider-Man: No Way Home was the highest-grossing film of the 2020s, becoming the highest-grossing Spider-Man film and non-Avengers Marvel film. It is currently the 6th highest-grossing film of all time.

The construction of the building originally started in 1975, but stopped permanently in 1981 because of economic constraints and political unrest at the time. Due to the unfinished building's resemblance to a skeleton, it was nicknamed after Skeletor, the arch-villain in He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which was popular in Poland at the time construction began.[156] The 2020 Summer Olympics was postponed to July\u2013August 2021.
