{"Content: ":"This article presents official statistics gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. The case count in mainland China only includes symptomatic cases. It excludes patients who test positive but do not have symptoms, of which there were 889 as of 11 February 2020.[1] Asymptomatic infections are reported separately.[2] It is also reported that there were more than 43,000 by the end of February 2020.[3][4][5] On 17 April, following the Wuhan government's issuance of a report on accounting for COVID-19 deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted by different hospitals, the NHC retrospectively revised their cumulative totals dating to 16 April, adding 325 cumulative cases and 1,290 deaths.[6] Around March 2020, there was speculation that China's COVID numbers were deliberately inaccurate, but now[when?] China's COVID elimination strategy is considered to have been successful and its statistics are considered to be accurate.[7][8][9] China is part of a small group of countries such as Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore that have pursued a zero-COVID strategy. The Chinese government's strategy involves extensive testing, mask wearing, temperature checks, ventilation, contact tracing, quarantines, isolation of infected people, and heavy restrictions in response to local outbreaks. Data is from the Chinese National Health Commission.               Hold cursor over location to display name; click to go to location article.
