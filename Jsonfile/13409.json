{"Content: ":"Francisco Pascual Eyegue Obama Asue is an Equatoguinean politician who has been Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea since 23 June 2016.[1][2] Prior to holding this position, he was the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and also the Minister of Trade. During his time as Minister of Trade he is known to have forbidden the imports of products made in Cameroon - a neighbouring country- because of his ties with Spanish import companies in the country. Since he was appointed Prime Minister in 2015, corruption has increased in the public administration, and most cabinet members recommended by him, including the presidential advisors or Consejeros, are known to be an example of unskilled people holding the top responsibilities[3] and Minister of Sports.[4] He is not related to former U.S. president Barack Obama.
