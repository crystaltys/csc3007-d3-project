{"Content: ":"Cathayopterus is an extinct genus of ctenochasmatid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous-age Yixian Formation of Liaoning, China. The name means \"China wing\", using the word \"Cathay\" as an old alternative name for China. The type species is C. grabaui, described in 2006 by Wang Xiaolin and Zhou Zhongh. It is a member of the Ctenochasmatidae, a clade of mostly filter feeding pterosaurs from the Jurassic and early Cretaceous.[1][2] Cathayopterus is only known from a skull preserved in dorsal view, which shows teeth splaying outwards at the tip of the rostrum, similar to Ctenochasma. The skull is incomplete, with the left side being damaged.[1] The cladogram below follows a phylogenetic analysis upheld by LÃ¼ and colleagues in 2016. They recovered Cathayopterus as a basal member of the family Ctenochasmatidae.[3] Cathayopterus Pterodaustro Ctenochasma Gegepterus Eosipterus Cearadactylus Gnathosaurus Pterodactylus longicolum Pterofiltrus Gladocephaloideus Elanodactylus Beipiaopterus Feilongus Moganopterus Cathayopterus was likely a filter feeder, just like other ctenochasmatid pterosaurs. It likely roamed around waterways to feed.[1]   ","Title":"Cathayopterus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"446","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathayopterus"}
