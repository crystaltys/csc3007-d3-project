{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of New Mexico on March 11, 2020. On December 23, 2020, the New Mexico Department of Health reported 1,174 new COVID-19 cases and 40 deaths, bringing the cumulative statewide totals to 133,242 cases and 2,243 deaths since the start of the pandemic.[1] During the last quarter of 2020, COVID-19 hospitalizations in New Mexico increased, reaching a peak of 947 hospitalizations on December 3. The most populous counties in the state have seen the largest number of infections, but by mid-April, the northwest counties of McKinley and San Juan became the most infected areas in the state, with Sandoval County also seeing a high infection rate. All of these counties have large Native American populations. According to the state's data dashboard, American Indians had nearly 58 percent of the statewide infection rates as of May 15. On April 25, McKinley County had the highest total number of cases while San Juan County had the highest number of deaths by April 26. However, by the end of July, Hispanics/Latinos had a plurality of cases. The portion of cases among American Indians continued to decline, and by mid February 2021 was below that of whites.[1] New Mexico restarted a vaccination incentive program offering $100 for any New Mexico resident who gets vaccinated. According to the state health department the first round of the program saw a 333% increase in single shot vaccinations and a 26% increase in completed vaccinations. Being fully vaccinated is not a requirement to receive the incentive which is being funded by federal stimulus money.[77] As of mid-May 2020, Native Americans comprised about 11% of New Mexico's population but made up a large proportion of positive cases of COVID-19 in New Mexico. Nearly 60% of the state's reported cases came from tribal communities, with Navajos accounting for 45% of New Mexico's positive cases.[78] Roughly 50% of all COVID-19 fatalities in New Mexico were Native American.[79] In response to the spread of COVID-19, the Navajo Nation closed their tribe-operated casinos in mid-March with reported plans to open in June 2020. The Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise stated that casino employees would still receive pay and benefits. Other operations of the Navajo Nation, such as public services through the judicial branch, would be provided electronically through July.[80] On March 12 the governor announced that all public schools in the state would be closed for three weeks beginning at the end of the school day on March 13.[81] On March 27 it was announced that schools would remain closed for the rest of the academic year. New education plans are in development including online or paper packets sent by mail as well as educational programs being developed for PBS stations beginning on April 6. Plans to determine \"demonstrations of competency\" for graduating seniors are also being worked out. Some school teachers will also receive training for new \"distance learning\" programs such as virtual classrooms.[82] Non-essential businesses have been ordered to close as of March 24. These include shopping malls, flea markets, movie theaters, gyms and health clubs, hair and nail salons, bars, nightclubs, entertainment venues, casinos and convention centers. Restaurants are open only to take-out orders. This order is in effect until April 10 but could be extended.[83] The order has been extended through April 30 with new restrictions on the number of customers and staff allowed inside a grocery or other large store to 20 percent or less the maximum occupancy limit as determined by the fire department. Hotels, RV parks and other lodgings must not operate at more than 25 percent maximum capacity, down from the previous 50 percent.[41] Stand-alone liquor stores are no longer considered essential businesses and were required to close on April 7.[84] The stay-at-home order was extended to May 15 with some new modifications allowing for non-essential businesses to provide curbside pick-up and delivery while some state parks and golf courses can reopen with some restrictions. Federally licensed firearm retailers can operate by appointment only. Pet care and veterinarians can also reopen. Previous restrictions on restaurants and grocery stores will remain in place.[41] Beginning on May 6 employees of grocery and large retail stores are required to wear face masks while other essential businesses will be required to ware a face covering beginning on May 11. While customers will not be required to wear masks businesses are encouraged to post signs asking people to wear them while also being able to set requirements at their own discretion.[69] While most religious institutions have suspended services, Governor Lujan Grisham expanded the ban on mass gatherings to include houses of worship on April 11, a day before Easter.[48] Legacy church in Albuquerque challenged the order claiming that about 30 people were needed in the building to produce their online services which the order prohibited more than five people gathering. A federal judge dismissed the motion on April 17.[85] Houses of worship will be able to reopen at 25 percent capacity starting May 16.[71] With one of the highest rates of infections in the state, the city of Gallup was put on lockdown beginning at noon on May 1 and scheduled to end at noon on May 4 unless extended. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham at the request of Mayor Louis Bonaguidi, invoked the state's Riot Control Act to close any roads leading into Gallup which sees thousands come into the town for shopping and other services from surrounding areas including the Navajo Nation. Non-residents may not enter the city and essential businesses can open at 8am and must close by 5pm while vehicles may have no more than two occupants.[65] The state national guard and state police were deployed to carry out this order trying to slow the spread of the virus.[86][87] The order was extended until noon on May 7[88] and a modified order was extended until noon on May 10 with roads into the city remaining closed to non-residents until 8pm on May 8.[89] On May 18, Gallup Police began enforcing a city ordinance requiring everyone over the age of two to wear a mask or face covering, issuing non-traffic citations to those in violation.[90] The number of confirmed infections among incarcerated individuals rose from less than two dozen on May 8, 2020, to more than 600 by June 5, 2020. This was 7% of statewide cases. Affected inmates were held at Cibola County Correctional Center, Otero County Prison Facility and the colocated ICE Otero County Processing Center, Santa Fe County's Penitentiary of New Mexico, Torrance County Detention Facility, and Valencia County's Central New Mexico Correctional Facility.[91][92] On June 11, a case was confirmed at Cibola County's Northwest New Mexico Correctional Facility.[93] On July 23, 2 cases were confirmed at Lea County Correctional Facility.[94] The next day, on July 24, cases were confirmed at Union County's Northeast New Mexico Correctional Facility and Cibola County's Western New Mexico Correctional Facility.[95] On September 23, an initial case was confirmed at Do√±a Ana County's Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility.[96] An initial case at Guadalupe County Correctional Facility was confirmed on October 31.[97] The following day, a case was confirmed at Roswell Correctional Center in Chaves County.[98] An initial case at Springer Correctional Center in Colfax County was confirmed on November 15, 2020.[99] The state Environment Department announced on December 9 that it would begin monitoring sewage from prisons and youth rehabilitation facilities to detect the virus.[100] Source: Analysis by the New Mexico Department of Health, as of July 22, 2022.[1]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in New Mexico - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10785","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_Mexico"}
