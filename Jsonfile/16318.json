{"Content: ":"The Freedom of Russia Legion[1] (Russian: Легион «Свобода России», romanized: Legion \"Svoboda Rossii\"; Ukrainian: Легіон «Свобода Росії», romanized: Lehion \"Svoboda Rosiji\"), also translated as the Freedom for Russia Legion,[2][3] is a legion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, formed in March 2022 to protect Ukraine against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian war. It consists of defectors of the Russian Armed Forces, as well as other Russian and Belarusian volunteers who have not previously been members of military formations.[4] The Legion uses the white-blue-white flag on the sleeve insignia instead of the official white-blue-red flag of Russia.[2][4] The \"Freedom of Russia\" Legion was formed from a company of the Russian Army (over 100 people), who voluntarily defected to the Ukrainian side. According to the company commander, on 27 February 2022, with the help of the Security Service of Ukraine, they joined the Ukrainian side to \"protect Ukrainians from real fascists\". He also called on his compatriots, soldiers of the Russian army, to join the \"Freedom of Russia\" Legion, in order to save their own people and the country \"from humiliation and destruction\".[5] The first volunteers of the \"Freedom of Russia\" Legion began individual preliminary training in late March 2022. In particular, the personnel of the legion under the guidance of instructors from the Ukrainian Armed Forces studied the peculiarities of the Swedish-British portable anti-tank guided short-range missile NLAW. The commanders of \"Freedom of Russia\" units got acquainted with the operational situation on the frontlines.[6] The Legion's stated goals are to repel the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ultimately depose the regime of Vladimir Putin.[7] The Freedom of Russia Legion is reportedly fighting alongside Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbas during the Eastern Ukraine offensive. The unit allegedly also organizes arson and sabotage acts inside Russia.[8] On 11 June 2022, it became known that Igor Volobuyev, the ex-vice-chairman of Gazprombank, who left Russia during the outbreak of the invasion, had joined the \"Freedom of Russia\" Legion.[9][10]","Title":"Freedom of Russia Legion - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16318","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Russia_Legion"}
