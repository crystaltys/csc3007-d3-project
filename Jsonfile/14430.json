{"Content: ":"Dudley Senanayake UNP Sirimavo Bandaranaike Sri Lanka Freedom Party Snap parliamentary elections were held in Ceylon in July 1960. The March 1960 election had left neither of Ceylon's two major parties with a majority, so another election was inevitable. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which had been in disarray since the murder of its leader S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike the previous year, settled on his widow, Sirimavo, as its new leader. She pledged to continue her husband's policies, notably the Sinhala Only Act, and to proceed with repatriation of the estate Tamils to India. However, she promised to reach a compromise with the Federal Party. The United National Party, led by Dudley Senanayake, refused to compromise with the Federal Party. It also differed with the SLFP over economic policy. The SLFP called for a socialist program of nationalization of both private enterprises and religious schools; the UNP preferred to leave both in private hands. The SLFP obtained a bare majority, despite getting a lower share of the popular vote than the UNP, and Mrs. Bandaranaike became prime minister.","Title":"July 1960 Ceylonese parliamentary election - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14430","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_1960_Ceylonese_parliamentary_election"}
