Later, his brother Mohammed Salih was admitted to Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode,[9] with suspected viral encephalitis. A team of doctors at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode suspected Nipah, as the symptoms were similar to that of his brother who had died by then.

The index patient had passed the virus to 16 persons at Medical College Hospital; later two more were infected, increasing the total count of infected to 18.
