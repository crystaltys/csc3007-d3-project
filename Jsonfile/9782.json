{"Content: ":"The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) is a London-based think tank discussing and modifying police responses to extremism.[1] Its founding CEO is Sasha Havlicek.[2] ISD runs a wide-ranging programme of work on extremism which ranges from traditional research papers[3] through to the facilitation of practitioners networks[4][5] and the development of counter narrative tools to combat extemism.[6] Their work ranges from work on Islamist extremism[7] through to far-right extremism[8] In delivering their projects, ISD partners with governments[9] and leaders of the technology sector, such as Google.[10] ISD also chairs the EU's Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) working group on the internet and social media.[11] Launched at the United Nations in September 2015, the Strong Cities Network (SCN) is the first ever global network of mayors, municipal-level policy-makers and practitioners committed to building social cohesion and countering violent extremism in all its forms.[12] In 2017 Google.org and ISD partnered to deliver a Â£1m innovation fund to counter hate and extremism in the UK.[18] The fund aims to support projects seeking to disrupt, undermine, counter or provide positive alternatives to hate and extremism.[citation needed] In 2017, ISD delivered a series of 'Be Internet Citizen workshops' youth centres across the UK in 2017. In 2018 ISD started working with Google to roll out the workshops into schools across the country, as well as supporting teachers and the youth sector with training and resources to deliver the curriculum independently.[citation needed] The Internet Citizens Curriculum aims to explain fake news, echo chambers and filter bubbles, helping young people become more confident in forming their opinions online and develop an increased critical awareness of the use of the content they consume.[citation needed] The ISD has researched the issue of mis- and disinformation around climate change.[19]","Title":"Institute for Strategic Dialogue - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9782","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Strategic_Dialogue"}
