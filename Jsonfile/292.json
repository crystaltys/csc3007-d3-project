{"Content: ":"See text Ichthyodectiformes is an extinct order of marine stem-teleost ray-finned fish. The order is named after the genus Ichthyodectes, established by Edward Drinker Cope in 1870. Ichthyodectiforms are usually considered to be some of the closest relatives of the teleost crown group.[1] They were most diverse throughout the Cretaceous period, though basal forms like Thrissops, Occithrissops and Allothrissops are known from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Europe and North America. Most ichthyodectiforms ranged between 1 and 5 meters (3\u201315 ft) in length. All known taxa were predators, feeding on smaller fish; in several cases, larger ichthyodectiforms preyed on smaller members of the order. Some species had remarkably large teeth, though others, such as Gillicus arcuatus, had small ones and sucked in their prey. There is evidence that at least one species, Xiphactinus audax, may have been endothermic (\"warm-blooded\").[2] The basal phylogeny is badly resolved, leading to many ichthyodectiforms that are simply known to be rather primitive, but where nothing certain can be said about their precise relationships. \u2020Ichthyodectiformes[1][3]    This article about a prehistoric ray-finned fish is a stub.
