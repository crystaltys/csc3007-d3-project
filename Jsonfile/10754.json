{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic reached Colorado on March 5, 2020, when the state's first two cases were confirmed. Many of the early COVID-19 cases in Colorado occurred in mountain resort towns such as Crested Butte, Aspen, and Vail, apparently brought in, and sometimes taken home, by international ski tourists.[5] In late 2020 a COVID-19 surge began in Colorado and most other mountain and Midwestern states, peaking in November/December. November 13's 6,437 COVID-19 cases and December 9's 267 COVID-related deaths set new single day records for Colorado.[6] On June 29, 2021 Colorado public health authorities (CDPHE) reported 343 COVID-19 cases, increasing the state's cumulative total of new cases since the start of the pandemic to 557,347.[6] Colorado's death toll is 6,788, with 12 new deaths reported over the past 24 hours. As of June 29, 9.67% of Colorado residents have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19.[7] The 7-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases in Colorado is 316 cases per day. Despite a rise in spring 2021, there has been a general downward trend in the number of new COVID-19 cases since late November, when the 7 day moving average hit 5,064 on November 21, 2020.[6] Governor Jared Polis issued a statewide mask mandate in mid-July to avoid the sharp surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths then observed in Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia and other states where mask wearing was optional.[8] A CDPHE web page explains the mask mandate and the science supporting the use of masks to reduce spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.[9] Ten months later, Colorado's per capita COVID-19 death rate is less than half that of South Dakota, whose governor, Kristi Noem, most notably refused to issue a mask mandate despite a severe surge in cases in autumn 2020.[10] The return of college students to the University of Colorado Boulder campus quickly resulted in a dramatic spike in COVID-19 cases. The average two week case rate among 18-22 year olds in Boulder County rose from 200 cases in early September to 3,780 cases by the end of the month.[11] The spike was limited to this narrow age group; the new case rate among all other age groups remained steady and low. The Boulder County Department of Public Health advised University of Colorado students to quarantine at home until October 5.[12] The quarantine order proved effective, and by mid October the two week case rate among all age groups in Boulder County had dropped to 250 or lower.[11] In Colorado, major COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in meatpacking plants in Weld and Morgan Counties, prisons in Washington and Crowley Counties, and in agricultural facilities in the San Luis Valley such as a mushroom \"factory\" near Alamosa and a potato packing shed near Center. About half of COVID-19 deaths in Colorado have been associated with nursing homes.[13] As of June 29, 2021 Colorado had administered 6,177,682 COVID-19 vaccine doses, 7% more than the state's entire adult population.[7] Since two doses are required for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the total number considered fully vaccinated is about 3 million residents, representing over 50 percent of the state's adult population.[14][15] Cases: Cumulative count of cases residing in Colorado. Incidence: New cases per 100,000 population per last 7 days. Sources: Daily CDPHE reports,[16] Official Colorado COVID-19 Updates[17][18][19][20][21] Note: Cases include people who test positive for COVID-19 and people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and are a close contact to someone who tested positive[17]  On March 5, 2020 public health officials reported the first two cases of coronavirus in the state. The first known case was a man in his 30s visiting Summit County who had traveled to Italy in February with a companion who later tested positive for the virus.[2][24] The second case was an elderly woman in Douglas County who had traveled on an international cruise.[25] Both cases were considered presumptive positives; they had been tested by the state but had not been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) for verification.[a] On March 6, with six new cases of coronavirus, the case count climbed to eight, seven of whom had traveled abroad recently.[26] On March 10, Governor Jared Polis declared a state of emergency.

The event was scheduled for the weekend of March 13.[31] On March 12, a Post Malone concert at Denver\u2019s Pepsi Center proceeded as scheduled, drawing a sellout-crowd of 20,000, likely the largest enclosed gathering in the U.S. before widespread lockdowns.[32] On March 12, a CU Boulder employee received a presumptive positive test for COVID-19. The employee worked on March 9 from 8 a.m. to noon in limited areas of the Center for Community dining center.[33] Despite Boulder County health's recommendations, the annual May Bolder Boulder race and the Boulder Creek Festival were still scheduled.[34] Many major school districts, including Denver Public Schools, Jefferson County Public Schools and Cherry Creek Public Schools, announced closures lasting at least two weeks.[35] Due to the current strain on medical facilities in mountain communities, Governor Jared Polis discouraged mountain travel for the elderly.[36] On March 13, Colorado reported its first COVID-19-related death: an 80-year-old woman with underlying health issues from El Paso County.[37][38] To offset the loss of quarantined medical personnel, Governor Jared Polis asked former doctors and nurses to rejoin the stressed medical workforce.[39] Due to low temperatures, the Lowry drive-up testing service did not operate. The state planned to move the drive-up testing to the Denver Coliseum, starting on March 14, subject to weather. The testing at the Coliseum would service a maximum of 150 patients. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) also planned to move the drive-up service to strategic locations as warranted.[40] In Aspen, 10 Australian ski vacationers were confirmed with the virus, with three others refusing testing. The three Australians who refused testing were quarantined for two weeks.[41] Michael Larson, of Crested Butte, in Gunnison County, owner of Mikey's Pizza died from COVID-19, on March 13, 2020. His test for the coronavirus was done post-mortem, and received back on March 23, making his death the first in Gunnison County, and also one of the earliest in Colorado.[42][43] On March 14, the state legislature went into recess for two weeks.[44][45] Governor Jared Polis issued an executive order to close downhill ski areas for a week, doing so \"with a profound sense of pain and grim responsibility.\" Some ski areas had already planned to close on March 15.[46][47][48][49] On March 16, Denver Mayor Hancock ordered all bars and restaurants to close by 8 a.m. on March 17 (except for food delivery and pickup) and banned gatherings of more than 50 people.[50] Governor Jared Polis expanded the closures by ordering a state-wide closure of dine-in services, gyms, casinos, and theaters.[51] On March 18, Governor Jared Polis closed schools until April 17 and banned gatherings of more than 10 people for the following 30 days. Polis also ordered ski resorts to remain closed until April 6.[52] The governor also expressed frustration with nonchalance regarding social distancing and announced the creation of a fund to aid Coloradans affected by COVID-19.[53] San Miguel County became the first county in the nation to plan to test all of its residents. It also ordered residents to \"shelter-in-place.\"[54] Gun sales skyrocket in Colorado, along with toilet paper, and hand sanitizer.[55] On March 19, Colorado reported two more COVID-19-related deaths, one of which was a man related to Colorado's first death.[56] Governor Jared Polis extended the closure of bars, restaurants, theaters, gymnasiums and casinos until April 30 and suspended all nonessential medical procedures. The governor also ordered the closure of \"nonessential\" businesses until April 30, which include nail salons, spas, and tattoo parlors.[57] On March 21, Rocky Mountain National Park closed after the mayor of Estes Park cited concerns about the novel coronavirus.[58] On March 23, Aytu BioScience, a pharmaceutical company in Colorado, announced that it developed a blood test that will deliver results in two to ten minutes at the point of care for antibodies for the COVID-19 virus. The FDA has now approved the test for distribution.[59] Denver Mayor Hancock announced a \"stay at home\" order for Denver county. This was to go into effect on Tuesday March 24 at 5pm.[60] On March 24, thirteen Colorado counties and multiple cities had announced some form of the stay-at-home order, including Adams County, Arapahoe County, Archuleta County, Boulder County, Broomfield County, Denver County, Douglas County, Eagle County, Grand County, Jefferson County, La Plata County, Pitkin County, and San Miguel County.[61] On March 25, Governor Jared Polis put the state of Colorado in complete lock-down, with a stay-at-home order. This started on Thursday March 26 at 6:00 a.m., and was scheduled to last through April 11.[62] Mesa Verde National Park Closed.[63] On March 26 Mike Willis, Colorado's director of emergency management, had a new coronavirus testing program, after receiving 5,000 test kits and expecting another 2,500. New locations will be set up to test the first responders and health workers. Colorado Parks and Wildlife will be closing all facilities, including camping at Colorado's state parks and State Wildlife Areas until further notice.[64] On March 27 Governor Jared Polis said that he is working to add 5,000 ICU beds to Colorado's capacity by the end of the summer and is in conversations to bring more ventilators to the state to treat sick COVID-19 patients.[65] The 8pm Denver Howl is started by folks in a neighborhood near the now closed Denver Botanic Gardens and Denver Zoo.[66] On March 28, Governor Jared Polis announced that the White House had approved his request to declare a major disaster for Colorado.[67] The status means the state is eligible to receive additional federal resources and funding to help address the pandemic.[65] The New York Post named Gunnison County, at 454.20 per 100,000 people and Eagle County at 331.74 per 100,000[68] as being two of the top four counties leading the nation in confirmed cases outside of New York and Louisiana. The other two counties are Blaine County, Idaho and Summit County, Utah. They state that this will no doubt overwhelm local hospitals.[69] Andy Larson of the Salt Lake Tribune did some math based on factual reporting, and put Gunnison County, Colorado third in the country for cases per capita. He listed Eagle County as eighth.[70] On March 29, CDOT, Colorado Department of Transportation, suspended the Bustang and Outrider through at least April 11.[71] On March 31, Gunnison County announced they will begin working with a company called Biobot, to test fecal samples from the sewer system, to track coronavirus.[72] The county will collect samples and send them back to Biobot which can produce results in about three days. The tests will help measure the scope of the outbreak in the county and track the impact of interventions, such as social distancing. It could also act as an early warning system for a re-emergence of cases.[73] Colorado Doctors are turning to telemedicine, to keep people out of the hospitals or ERs where their chance at the infection of COVID-19 is higher. Many Health insurance companies will pay the Doctors the same rate for a virtual visit as in-person. Previously, insurance companies only paid about half as much. Also, Medicare may waive co-payments on these visits, making a virtual visit an affordable way to maintain the spread of infection.[74] The demand for guns in Colorado continues to rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the CBI strongly encouraging firearm dealers to hold firearms until the background checks are completed, gun shops are considered essential businesses under the state's stay-at-home order and are classified as \"critical retail,\" along with grocery stores, gas stations, marijuana dispensaries, liquor stores, and several other businesses.[75] Mike Wills, director of the state's Office of Emergency Management, said that Budweiser Events Center could serve as a temporary hospital as Colorado prepares for the coronavirus surge.[76] At the end of March, the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs eased some of its social distancing measures for its on-campus cadets, after two seniors committed suicide there in the prior week.

Based on a four-tier system, the comprehensive 22-page document will prevent health care workers from making decisions about care based on gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, and other non-health related factors. The document states that decisions should not be made based on a person's status or position.[83] Colorado sees significant declines in air pollution due to a decline in driving during coronavirus outbreak.[84] On April 6, Colorado's mountain communities are dealing with high altitude issues concerning coronavirus. By moving their patients to lower altitudes, they hope that their patients will need less supplemental oxygen. Dr. Jason Hogan, an emergency medicine physician at Gunnison Valley Health, has started transporting patients from Gunnison, at an altitude of 7,700 feet, to Montrose at 5,800 feet, and Grand Junction at 4,500 feet, to help with the significant amount of oxygen they need. Vail Health Hospital's chief medical officer, Dr. Barry Hammaker, said they are transporting patients to Denver and Grand Junction.[85] Due to the high skier/tourist population, Colorado mountain communities became hotspots for the new coronavirus early on in the pandemic, resulting in the closure of ski resorts and requests for tourists to return home.[86] Governor Jared Polis in a special address extends the stay-at-home order to April 26, 2020. \"If there is any way to safely end it sooner, then we will,\" Polis added. \"And likewise if Coloradans aren't staying at home and the numbers of the dead and dying continue to increase, then it could go longer.\"[87] On April 7, tourists and second homeowners could face 18 months in jail or a fine of up to five thousand dollars if they visit Gunnison County in Colorado during the pandemic.[88] Officials initiated the public health order stating non-residents and tourists must stay out to help slow the spread of the virus. In the statement, the public health director said people from lower altitudes were at greater risk for COVID-19 complications than people who live in the high-altitude.[89] On April 9, the Texas attorney general's office wrote a letter to the director of Gunnison county's Department of Health and Human Services, saying that the Colorado county's call for all non-residents to leave the county is unconstitutional. The letter said, \u201cWhile the order contains other laudable measures aimed at protecting public health, its patent discrimination against non-resident homeowners \u2013 including Texans who own homes in Gunnison County \u2013 runs afoul of the United States Constitution.\u201d[90] Senator Kerry Donovan, said it's better for people to stay home, where they have a support system in place.[91] The National Western Complex becomes a shelter for homeless men during the COVID-19 pandemic.[92] On April 10, Attorney General Phil Weiser supports Gunnison County public health order as does Governor Polis' stay-at-home executive order, telling non-residents to leave.[93] The \"8 p.m. Howl\" was reported to have spread in popularity throughout the entire United States.[94] Started two weeks before, the nightly howl received support from Polis and media coverage.[95] On April 11, at least 50 employees at a meatpacking plant in Greeley, Colorado have contracted Coronavirus, and two have died. Governor Jared Polis, says that JBS USA would be closed until all workers could be tested. Vice President Mike Pence said that supplies to do so were on their way. \u201cAnd I want to encourage people in Colorado that we will work to support that effort, but I also want to emphasize that all of the people that are working in the food supply, from farmers to meatpackers to distributors to truckers to grocers, continue to have our gratitude,\u201d Pence said.[96][97] On April 12, concerns were raised nationally regarding the potential for COVID-19 spreading during April 12 Easter celebrations in churches, though many churches had previously announced the transition to online services in light of this danger.[98] On April 16, it has been confirmed that Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller tested positive for the coronavirus.[99] On April 17, Governor Jared Polis said that the National Guard will be testing 3 Colorado nursing homes for coronavirus.[100] On April 18, protests are planned against the stay-at-home order to take place on April 19, at the Colorado State Capitol.[101] To mark the April 18 graduation of cadets from the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs\u2013including the first cadets to commission into the newly created Space Force\u2013the Air Force Thunderbirds display team released their flight plan for their F-16s to fly along much of the Front Range, from Boulder to Pueblo.[102] The flight is also intended to honor first-responders and essential workers currently helping fight the coronavirus.[103] On April 19, before Sunday's protest at the Capitol, Governor Polis informed the public through a spokesperson of Coloradan's right to protest, hoping that those protesting were doing so safely.

In the meantime, there were strategies being executed to help combat COVID-19 despite lack of access to testing. Also, a possible blood test that would show antibodies began to show promise.[108] Governor Jared Polis, outlined safer-at-home policies and emphasized that unnecessary travel was still not recommended.[109] Also on April 23, Eagle County was the first in the state to be released from the stay-at-home order following a significant decline in cases in the county. The allowance for Eagle County businesses to re-open and for citizens to travel was restricted to only those within the county and prohibited citizens from elsewhere in the state from traveling to Eagle.[110] JBS meatpacking plant in Greeley, reopened April 24, after being closed for 8 days. Testing will take place for any employee showing symptoms. Weld County Health Department will oversee testing at the plant for morning and evening shifts.

Under Williams' leadership, JBS had to close plants in Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, due to the virus, while facilities in Texas and Utah also had problems. At the Greeley, Colorado plant, more than 300 cases and at least eight deaths were reported.[131] Cases continued to rise through September, reaching the highest levels since July. Boulder County accounted for around one in every five new cases.[132] The University of Colorado-Boulder confirmed 1,198 cases among students and 12 staff members, prompting the University to order only remote learning for at least two weeks. The rise in cases at the University is believed to be driven by informal student interactions and parties.[133] The September spike among college age students was documented by the Boulder County Department of Public Health, which showed a nearly 16-fold increase in new COVID-19 cases among 18-22 year olds but no significant rise among all other age groups in Boulder County.[11] In a statement on November 28, Governor Jared Polis and his partner Marlon Reis announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19.

The outbreak began at the Aurora location on December 6 and at the Colorado Springs location on December 17.[141] On March 7, a large gathering on University Hill near CU Boulder coalesced into a riot of about 800 students. The riot has since been described by some as a significant violation of COVID-related regulations at both Boulder and the CU Boulder campus, with concerns that the riot would result in a slower re-opening of the campus and further prohibitions on student gatherings. Several police officers were reported to have been injured by the students.[142][143] April 6, the first COVID-19 P.1 variant cases are reported in Colorado. The two people that tested positive are residents of Boulder county. Public health officials originally identified the P.1 variant among travelers from Brazil and P.1 has been nicknamed the Brazil variant.[144] The B.1.617.2 variant, one of several first found in India, is first reported in Colorado on May 6. The five people who tested positive hadn\u2019t recently traveled outside Mesa County.[145] During a surge in infections driven largely by the Omicron variant, Colorado hospitals were overwhelmed, at times to the point when they could not provide what under normal conditions would be consider the minumum of adequate medical care. The state activated crisis standards of care for medical staffing on November 9, 2021, and for emergency medical services on January 7, 2022. Normal standards of care were reinstated on February 17, 2022.[146]  On March 10, Governor Jared Polis declared a state of emergency, ordering the state's Department of Labor and Employment to develop rules for requiring employees in sectors such as foodservice and health care be offered paid sick leave if they display symptoms.[147] The March 14 executive order to close ski areas for a week was the second most significant action by the governor.[147] On March 22, Governor Jared Polis ordered non-essential businesses to reduce the number of people physically present in the workplace by at least 50 percent via remote work.[148] Colorado was set to purchase 500 ventilators before the Federal Emergency Management Agency swooped in and bought them first. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that the federal government would be sending 100 ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Cory Gardner.[149] The incident caused Governor Polis to make future supply purchases in secret.[150] On March 17, both Senator Cory Gardner and Representative Jason Crow elected to self-quarantine for 14 days, until March 25. Both Gardner and Crow interacted with a Coloradan who tested positive for COVID-19 on March 11. The legislators represented two of 14 members of the U.S. Congress who decided to self-quarantine.[151][152] On March 19, Colorado State Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet reported testing positive for coronavirus. Michaelson Jenet was the first member of the Colorado General Assembly to report testing positive for coronavirus and elected to self-quarantine in her home. Michaelson Jenet was at the Colorado Capitol on March 14, the day it closed due to the virus.[153] The COVID-19 vaccine has been referred to as \"the most valuable asset on earth\"; Interpol called it \"liquid gold\" and warned of an \"onslaught of all types of criminal activity\".[154] Vaccine shipments will be escorted by Colorado State Patrol officers from Denver International Airport to the state's eight distribution points; the exact plans are confidential and law enforcement will \"maintain a low-key profile\".[155] Most of the state's sports teams were affected by the pandemic. Several leagues began postponing or suspending their seasons starting March 12. Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training on that date, and on March 16, they announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, affecting the Colorado Rockies.[156] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, affecting the Denver Nuggets.[157] The 2019\u201320 Colorado Avalanche season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time as the National Hockey League suspended the season.[158] After a player on the Ottawa Senators tested positive for coronavirus on March 17, concerns arose about the Avalanche's potential exposure.

Other Christian denominations, such as Methodist and evangelical churches, began to close or announce alterations to their schedule around the same date.[162] Highland United Methodist Church in Denver was opened to allow for an assembly line manned by volunteers to produce protective masks in early April.[163] Messiah Baptist Church in Denver received criticism for remaining open. A statement from the church said, \"We are NOT canceling any service due to the covid-19 [sic] virus, snow, hail, wind, locust or any other natural or super natural [sic] event with the exception of the rapture. If Christ comes to call us home, whoever is left behind can do what they want.\"[164][165] The Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, and Fuel Church organized in April to help deal with the increase in the need for meal donations and food assistance in Colorado Springs. The economic impact of the virus left an increase in donation requests across the state.[166] Restrictions ordered by Governor Polis, in certain localities, restricted capacity of worship services to 25 percent or a maximum of 50 people. High Plains Harvest Church of Ault went to court against the state, arguing that the limitations imposed were \"draconian numerical limits\" and that places of worship were more regulated by the restrictions than retail shopping. This challenge, as well as one raised by a Catholic priest and a rabbi from New Jersey, both argued that such restrictions were unconstitutionally targeting religion. The United States Supreme Court on December 15, 2020 sided with the churches, sending the cases back to lower courts for review with Colorado's government informing the Supreme Court that it had moved \"to remove capacity limits on all houses of worship at all times in response to this Court's recent decisions.\"[167] The Catholic Archdiocese of Denver began cancelling public services in March, including cancelling Sunday Mass through April 17. Holy Week Masses were moved to live-streams from each parish, as well as Masses featuring Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila. The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults was moved to the 30 May Pentecost Vigil.[168] In the Diocese of Pueblo, Bishop Stephen Jay Berg offered dispensation for those who were experiencing flu-like symptoms in early March. On Sunday, March 8, parishes in the diocese stopped filling Holy Water fonts and stopped offering the eucharistic Blood of Christ in the chalice.[169] On March 13, the diocese cancelled all Masses following Governor Polis banning all public gatherings of 250 people or more and closed the schools operated by the diocese.[170] March 13 announcement, made by the Archdiocese of Denver, affected the entire ecclesiastical Province of Denver, including the Diocese of Colorado Springs.[171] On April 12, the Easter Mass held at Denver's Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception was broadcast live by KDVR.[172] A spokesperson for the archdiocese described participating in Easter celebrations from home as an act of charity.[98] On Tuesday, 1 September, Father Daniel Nolan, a Catholic Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter priest at the Fraternity's Littleton parish of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel told parishioners at a catechetical lesson to \u201cdisobey your bishop, disobey your governor\u201c and not wear a mask, calling the reporting and response to COVID-19 a \u201cscamdemic\u201d and \u201cattempted communist takeover of the United States.\u201d The parish posted the video on YouTube on Tuesday before taking it down Wednesday. The Archdiocese of Denver, in which the parish is located and Archbishop Samuel Aquila governs, and the Fraternity both launched a review of the priest and his statements, which some interpreted as violating Catholic teachings on ecclesiastical and civil authority.[173] The Archdiocese of Denver maintained its dispensation from the Sunday Mass obligation, publishing guidelines that laity should discern whether they are in significant health danger, interacting with individuals in significant health danger, or were using the dispensation as an excuse to stay home. Due to Colorado's designation of places of worship as \"essential,\" parishes in the state remained open through the renewal of restrictions and stay-at-home orders in the final quarter of 2020.[174][175] On Pentecost Sunday, May 23, 2021, the Archdiocese of Denver lifted its canonical dispensation from attendance of Mass on Sundays and Holy Days.[176] The Episcopal Church in Colorado, the sole Episcopal diocese in the state, released a statement for Bishop Kimberly Lucas on the pandemic on March 13, 2020. The statement announced the cessation of public services on March 22 to last until April 1, with congregations in more heavily affected areas\u2013which the Bishop cited as Denver, Pitkin, and Eagle counties\u2013to immediately stop offering services.[177] Beginning Sunday, March 15, Episcopalian parishes began using live-streaming services to allow congregants to watch from home upon the recommendation of Reverend Canon Carl M. Andrews, the diocese's Disaster Response Director.[178] Bishop Lucas released a statement on June 3, 2020 announcing that on June 5 the diocese would move to \"Season II\" and that congregations could begin to regather.[179] Following directives from the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops, Bishop Lucas released a further statement on September 1 that\u2013using the Book of Common Prayer's permissions for special administration of communion and following safety guidelines\u2013reception of the sacrament by the laity would soon resume.[180] Temple Emanuel in Pueblo had already cancelled its Passover Seder events in April when a suspected arson attack on March 11 destroyed much of the interior of the building.[169][181] Most other synagogues in Colorado had cancelled their public events and services by March 19. Some Jewish schools, such as Garden Preschool in Lone Tree, began using video communication to interact with students.[182] Temple Emanuel in Denver offered online courses on how to parent and educate students during the pandemic.[183] In late April, celebrations of Ramadan began with alterations. Some in the Colorado Muslim community express concerns that immigrants that were only able to communicate with others at their local mosque would find the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d period particularly trying. The Downtown Denver Islamic Center announced it would provide online courses throughout Ramadan.[184] Despite the urgency for testing Coloradans for COVID-19, frustrations with the state's limited testing capacity and slow response time continued through the first months of the pandemic.[185] Governor Jared Polis has noted that expanding testing capacity is \"absolutely critical\", yet limited supplies and a small number of trained medical staff have resulted in a low testing rate.[185] While CDPHE implemented a mobile testing site in Lowry, Denver (later moved to the Denver Colosseum), the site closed due to long lines.[186] By March 18, 2020 no private laboratories were performing tests[185] and only people who exhibited the most severe symptoms were being prioritized for testing.[187] While some tests can be completed in a matter of hours, Colorado's test results have taken up to five days.[185]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Colorado - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10754","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Colorado"}
