{"Content: ":"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.[1][2] It currently consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist and bassist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine.[3] The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by the hit singles \"Harder to Breathe\", \"This Love\" and \"She Will Be Loved\", the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart[4] and went quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.[5] In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released in May 2007.[6] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, the band released the third album Hands All Over, to favorable reviews, re-releasing a year later to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician PJ Morton, as the band released the fourth album Overexposed, with the song \"One More Night\", topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks. In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album V (roman numeral pronounced \"five\"), with the band signed to Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the release of V, it reached number one on the Billboard 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band continued for the sixth studio album Red Pill Blues, which was released in November 2017. With the addition of Morton and Farrar, the band's lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums \"Sugar\" and \"Girls Like You\" peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively. The band's seventh album Jordi, was released in June 2021. Maroon 5 has sold more than 135 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.[7] Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old, and Dusick was 16.[8] Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood School in Los Angeles.[9][10] While attending Brentwood School, Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers,[11] a rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a \"collective crush\" on.[10] While they were playing a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is known for his work on Dirty Dancing (1987) \u2013 including \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\". Producer Rob Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album.[12] However, after the release of The Fourth World, during Levine and Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop.[10] Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, \"Soap Disco\", was a failure.[13] According to Levine, the failure of the album was \"a huge disappointment\" that nearly led them to break up in 1999.[10][14] The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after six months.[15] Dusick and Madden attended college locally at University of California, Los Angeles, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York.[16] While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.[17] When the band returned in 2001, they brought those influences with them.[14] Sam Farrar (bassist of the band Phantom Planet) explained that the Aaliyah song \"Are You That Somebody?\" affected the band and influenced the song \"Not Coming Home\".[10] Producer Tim Sommer signed them to a demo deal with MCA Records and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles in the middle of 2001, with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer's advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum.[14] While looking for talent for the Octone label, Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at Columbia Records and the song that caught his attention was \"'Sunday Morning'\" which he referred to as a \"genius song\".[15] Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara's Flowers, because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at Warner Bros. Records.[18] Berkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers.[15] After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a \"fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so he could be the star I perceived him to be\".[15] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past.[15] Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job.[14] On his joining the band, Valentine commented: \"I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them.\"[14] After hearing Levine play, Valentine noticed his affinity for Phish and the two musicians bonded over the band.[19] Between the time that we started making the album [Songs About Jane] in 2001 and the time the album reached the crest of its success in 2004, we went from being starving musicians wondering what the future held to riding a wave of success beyond our wildest expectations. \u2014Ryan Dusick, Maroon 5's original drummer, who officially left the band in 2006, due to injuries to his shoulders and wrists sustained from constant touring.[20][21] James Valentine attended Berklee College of Music with John Mayer in 1996, where they developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at a Mayer radio broadcast. After Mayer heard their album, he was so impressed (particularly by \"This Love\", which became the most successful release off the album and propelled the band to superstardom) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour.[10] The first single, \"Harder to Breathe\", slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album. By March 2004, the album had reached the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and \"Harder to Breathe\" had made the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 in September 2004,[22] 26 months after its release; this was the longest period between an album's release and its initial Top 10 appearance since SoundScan results were included in the Billboard 200 in 1991.[23] The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. This had all happened after the band \"abandoned its post-grunge roots for a radio-friendly pop-soul sound, even while dabbling in hard rock\".[attribution needed][24] Mayer invited the band to open for him again in 2004.[25] Over the next three years, the band toured virtually non-stop, including visits to seventeen countries. During this time, the band toured with Michelle Branch, Graham Colton, and the Rolling Stones.[26][27] Other acts the band toured alongside included Gavin DeGraw,[28] Matchbox Twenty, Sugar Ray,[29] Counting Crows,[30] Phantom Planet,[31] the Hives,[32] Dashboard Confessional,[33] Simon Dawes,[34] the Thrills, Thirsty Merc, Marc Broussard, the Donnas, the RedWest, Michael Tolcher, and Guster.[35] Songs About Jane eventually reached No. 1 on the Australian albums (ARIA),[36] while \"Harder to Breathe\" made the Top 20 singles charts in the US[37] and UK,[36] and Top 40 in Australia and New Zealand.[36] The album also eventually climbed to number-one in the UK.[36] The second single, \"This Love\", reached number five in the US,[37] number three in the UK, and number eight in Australia.[36] The third single, \"She Will Be Loved\", reached the number five in both the US[37] and the UK, and number-one in Australia.[36] The fourth single, \"Sunday Morning\", reached the Top 40 in the US,[37] UK, and Australia.[36] Maroon 5 played Live 8, in Philadelphia in 2005. Their set included a cover of Neil Young's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and frontman Levine performed with one of his heroes, and the closing act, Stevie Wonder.[38] On May 13, 2005, in Santa Barbara, California, the band wrapped up the 2005 Honda Civic Tour, which it headlined.[39] On June 9, 2005, the band performed at the American Film Institute's tribute to filmmaker George Lucas. Lucas himself had selected Maroon 5 for the event, as it was his children's favorite band at the time.[40] Over the years of touring with the band their drummer, percussionist and backing vocalist Ryan Dusick had been suffering from the touring life.[41] The strains of non-stop touring aggravated an old sports injury.[9] After several absences from the tour with Ryland Steen and Josh Day taking his place, Dusick officially left the band in September 2006.[21] Matt Flynn, the former drummer of Gavin DeGraw and The B-52's, joined the band as Dusick's replacement.[42] After recording for eight months, Maroon 5's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long, was released worldwide in May 2007 by A&M Octone Records.[43] Levine described the follow-up to Songs About Jane is \"sexier and stronger\",[44] gaining inspiration from iconic 80s artists such as Prince, Shabba Ranks, Michael Jackson and Talking Heads.[45] Ann Powers writing for Los Angeles Times said It Won't Be Soon Before Long is \"An icy-hot blend of electro-funk and blue-eyed soul that works its cruel streak with the confidence of Daniel Craig's James Bond\".[46] Before its release, \"Makes Me Wonder\" was the No. 1 selling single and video on iTunes.[44] It was also the No. 1 selling album, with more than 50,000 digital pre-sales.[44] After its release, the album broke iTunes sales records its week of release, selling over 101,000 copies.[47] The first single \"Makes Me Wonder\", was released to radio March 27, 2007. The song debuted at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100, the lowest debuting single of the group's five chart entries. In the first week of May, the single skyrocketed from a lowly position of No. 64 to No. 1, the biggest jump in Billboard history at the time.[48] \"Makes Me Wonder\" has also achieved No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs, Pop 100, and Hot Dance Club Play charts.[49] To support the album, the band performed on a ten-date club tour in which visited small venues in Europe and the United States from April to June 2007.[50][51] The band followed with a concert that streamed live via MSN Music in mid-June.[52] On July 10, it opened for The Police in Miami,[53] and followed with an acoustic performance at the Miami club, Studio A, the next day.[54] Later, the band headlined the It Won't Be Soon Before Long Tour took place in late 2007, where they toured 28 cities in North America.

So minor, funk and heartbreak -- that's the Maroon 5 formula. \u2014James Valentine[170] Maroon 5's musical style has generally been regarded as pop,[171][172] pop rock,[171][173] funk rock,[174][175] dance-pop,[176][177] blue-eyed soul,[178][179] neo soul,[171] soft rock,[180][181] and indie rock.[172] Adam Levine has stated: \"Everything that's written and performed and put together pretty much comes from us. I just think people would be surprised to know that we're a self-contained unit. We're a band that does their own thing. There's no puppet master.\"[182] However, in an article about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band's songs, such as \"Moves like Jagger,\" are the product of efforts by or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers.[183] In the same article, Levine says, \"It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best.\"[184] Adam Levine cited Britpop band Oasis as \"one of the best bands ever\" and said \"We love Oasis\".[185] The band has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, The Police, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, the Bee Gees, Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences.[186][187][188] Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence.[38] Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age.[189] The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer.

We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm just glad that everyone likes it.\"[191] James Valentine called Overexposed \"our most 'pop' record ever and we weren't shy about really going for it\".[192] They also have experimented with new wave[193][194][195] and disco[196][197] sounds on several albums. In an interview with Variety in November 2018, the frontman of the band, Adam Levine, when asked if the band is pop, rock or urban, said, \"Something unique to this band is that we have always looked to hip-hop, R&B, all rhythmic forms of music, from back when we were writing our first album to now. Rock music is nowhere, really. I don\u2019t know where it is. If it\u2019s around, no one\u2019s invited me to the party. All of the innovation and the incredible things happening in music are in hip-hop\".[198] This statement prompted widespread criticism from rock fans and some rockstars such as Slipknot's frontman Corey Taylor.

The videos showed Levine when he was leaving the stage, angry and saying that \"they were deceived\", \"that was a TV show! ... that was not a concert\", and that Viña del Mar is a \"shitty city,\" sparking criticism.[201] Levine later posted on Instagram to apologize for the incident[202] and the band said they had experienced technical difficulties with the audio feed to Levine's in ear monitors.[203] Current members Former members Studio albums as Kara's Flowers Maroon 5 have been the recipients of three Grammy Awards,[5][204] three American Music Awards,[205][206][207] and three People's Choice Awards,[208] with five Teen Choice Awards,[209] and eight Billboard Music Awards.
