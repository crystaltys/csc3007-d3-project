{"Content: ":"The monarchy of Cambodia is the head of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia. In the contemporary period the King's power has been limited to that of a symbolic figurehead. The monarchy had been in existence since at least 68 AD except during its abolition from 1970 to 1993. Since 1993, the King of Cambodia has been an elected monarch, making Cambodia one of the few elective monarchies of the world. The king is elected for life by the Royal Council of the Throne, which consists of several senior political and religious figures. Candidates are chosen from among descendants of Monarch Ang Duong who are at least 30 years old, from the two royal houses of Cambodia (the House of Norodom and the House of Sisowath). Cambodia's constitution, promulgated in 1993 stipulated the king's role as a mainly ceremonial one. It declared that the king \"shall reign, but not govern\"[1] as well as being the \"symbol of national unity and continuity\".[2] The king performs important functions of state as required by the constitution. This includes but is not limited to: The king also fulfils other roles not explicitly mentioned in the constitution in his capacity as head of state, for example, presiding over events of national significance[17] including religious ceremonies and traditions integral to the Khmer nation,[18] supporting humanitarian and philanthropic causes,[19] and representing Cambodia abroad when undertaking official visits overseas.[20] Although there have been female rulers in the past, the 1993 constitution currently forbids women from succeeding to the throne.[21] The Ministry of the Royal Palace, currently overseen by Minister Kong Sam Ol in conjunction with the Supreme Privy Advisory Council, headed by the King's half-brother Prince Norodom Ranariddh assists and advises the king accordingly in carrying out his duties as monarch.
