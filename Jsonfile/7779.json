{"Content: ":"The Brondings were a Germanic tribe. They and Breca the Bronding are mentioned in Beowulf (Th. 1047; B. 521.), as Beowulf's childhood friend, and in Widsith (Scóp Th. 51; Wíd. 25.), where Breca is the lord of the Brondings. They were probably the people of the Swedish island of Brännö, west of Gothenburg in the Kattegatt.  This article about an ethnic group in Europe is a stub.
