It is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe with around 490/km2 (1,300/sq mi). The Flemish Region should not be confused with the Flemish Community: the latter encompasses both the inhabitants of the Flemish Region and the Dutch-speaking minority living in the Brussels-Capital Region. Immediately after its establishment in 1980, the region transferred all its constitutional competencies to the Flemish Community. Thus, the current Flemish authorities (Flemish Parliament and Flemish Government) represent all the Flemish people, including those living in the Brussels-Capital Region. Hence, the Flemish Region is governed by the Flemish Community institutions. However, members of the Flemish Community parliament elected in the Brussels-Capital Region have no right to vote on Flemish regional affairs. The Flemish Region comprises five provinces, each consisting of administrative arrondissements that, in turn, contain municipalities (in total 300 municipalities in Flanders). The seat of the Flemish parliament is located in Brussels, which is an enclave within \u2013 but not part of \u2013 the Flemish region, being specified that the Brussels-Capital Region is established as an administrative region of Belgium in its own right. In contrast, the Walloon parliament has established its parliament in the territory of Wallonia, specifically in the city of Namur, Namur Province. Both the Flemish Community (which is a different entity from the Flemish Region) and French Community (which is a different entity from Wallonia) have jurisdiction over the area of the Brussels-Capital Region. Consequently, these constituent constitutional linguistic communities, unlike their somewhat related regions, do not have a defined number of inhabitants. Both of these communities have their institutions in Brussels. Flanders is home to a diversified modern economy, with emphasis put on research and development. Many enterprises work closely with local knowledge and research centres to develop new products and services.[5] The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 270 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 59% of Belgium's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 36,300 \u20ac or 136% of the EU27 average in the same year.[6] \"De Lijn\" serves as the main public transport company, run by the Flemish government. It consists of buses and trams. TEC is the equivalent company in Wallonia, and MIVB-STIB in Brussels. The railway network run by the NMBS, however, is a federal responsibility. The Flemish government is also responsible for about 500 kilometers of regional roads (Dutch: gewestwegen) and about 900 kilometers of highways in the territory of the Flemish Region. Other types of roads are provincial roads and municipal roads. Largest cities in the region include (with population figures as of 1 January 2018):[7] The Flemish Diamond (Dutch: Vlaamse Ruit) is the name of the central, populous area in Flanders and consists of several of these cities, such as Antwerp, Ghent, Leuven and Mechelen. Approximately 5,500,000 people live in the area. The official language of the Flemish Region is Dutch.[8] The dialect cluster spoken in the region is sometimes colloquially referred to as Flemish (Vlaams),[9][10][11] Flemish Dutch (Vlaams-Nederlands), Belgian Dutch (Belgisch-Nederlands), or Southern Dutch (Zuid-Nederlands). Spelling and grammar are regulated by a single authority, the Dutch Language Union (Nederlandse Taalunie), comprising a committee of ministers of the Flemish and Dutch governments, their advisory council of appointed experts, a controlling commission of 22 parliamentarians, and a secretariat.[12][13] The term Flemish can be applied to the Dutch spoken in Flanders; it shows many regional and local variations.[14] The main dialect groups include West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish. French (specifically Belgian French) may also be used in the Flemish Region for certain administrative purposes in a limited number of the so-called \"municipalities with language facilities\" around the Brussels-Capital Region and on the border with Wallonia. These \"rim municipalities\" around Brussels are Drogenbos, Kraainem, Linkebeek, Sint-Genesius-Rode, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem. Brussels was originally a Dutch-speaking city (Brabantian dialect to be exact),[15] but it was francised in the 19th and 20th centuries and is now officially bilingual in French and Dutch[8] (although largely French-speaking in practice).[16] Municipalities with language facilities on the border with Wallonia are Bever (French: Biévène), Herstappe, Mesen (French: Messines), Ronse (French: Renaix), Spiere-Helkijn (French: Espierres-Helchin), and Voeren (French: Fourons). Religion in the Flemish Region in 2016[17] According to a 2016 survey by the Free University of Brussels, 68% of Flemish citizens are Roman Catholic, 2% are Protestant, 26% are irreligious, while 2% have other religions.[17]","Title":"Flemish Region - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5812","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Region"}
