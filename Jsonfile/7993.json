SHOX was first found during a search for the cause of short stature in women with Turner syndrome, where there is loss of genetic material from the X chromosome, typically by loss of one entire X chromosome.[2] Since its discovery, the gene has been found to play a role in idiopathic short stature, LÃ©ri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, and Langer mesomelic dysplasia. Gene dosage effects of extra copies of SHOX may be a cause of the increased stature seen in other sex chromosome aneuploidy conditions such as triple X, XYY, Klinefelter, XXYY and similar syndromes.[3] SHOX is composed of 6 different exons and is located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the X chromosome (Xp22.33) and Y chromosome.[2] Since genes in PAR escape X inactivation, their dosage changes with sex chromosome aneuploidies such as Turner.[4] Similar genes are present in a variety of animals and insects. It is a homeobox gene, meaning that it helps to regulate development.","Title":"Short-stature homeobox gene - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7993","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-stature_homeobox_gene"}
