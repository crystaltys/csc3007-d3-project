{"Content: ":"The demolition of monuments to Alexander Pushkin in Ukraine started during the Russo-Ukrainian War. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine it has become a widespread phenomenon and dubbed by Ukrainians Pushkinopad (Пушкінопад), a pun literally translated as \"Pushkinfall\", with the coinage of \"-пад\" being akin to English words suffixed with \"fall\" as in \"waterfall\", \"snowfall\", etc. This wave of dismantling is connected with the process of derussification in Ukraine.
