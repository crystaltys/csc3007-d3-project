{"Content: ":"Russian separatist forces in Donets Basin are militias and armed volunteer groups affiliated with the Russian-recognized pro-Russian breakaway regions in the Donbas region of Ukraine: the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The main groups are the Donetsk People's Militia and Luhansk People's Militia, which have been fighting the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War. They are designated as terrorist groups by the Government of Ukraine.[7] The Donbas People's Militia was formed in March 2014 by Pavel Gubarev, who was elected \"People's Governor\" of Donetsk Oblast.[8] The Army of the South-East was formed in April 2014 in Luhansk Oblast. They were originally involved in taking control of Ukrainian government buildings in the oblasts. Tensions increased to the point of the Ukrainian government launching the Anti-Terrorist Operation against the militias, triggering the War in Donbas. The militias were accused by the Ukrainian government of culpability in shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014, but the separatist leaders denied it.[9] In September 2014, the militias of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics merged under the umbrella of the United Armed Forces of Novorossiya (Russian: Объединённые Вооруженные Силы Новороссии; acronym NAF),[2][10] which was to be affiliated with the unrecognized political union of Novorossiya (New Russia). The two militias became the DPR 1st Army Corps[11] and LPR 2nd Army Corps.[12] However, the Novorossiya project was suspended in May 2015. It is widely believed that the separatists are supported by the Russian Armed Forces.[13] Ukraine, the United States, and some analysts consider 1st and 2nd Army Corps to be Russian formations under the command of the 8th Combined Arms Army,[14][15][16][17] which was formed in 2017 in Novocherkassk, Rostov Oblast. Although the Russian government often denies direct involvement, saying their soldiers were there voluntarily and not under orders, some of them have been captured with documents that said otherwise.[18] The separatists have admitted receiving supplies from Russia and being trained there. BBC reported that separatist ranks are composed of thousands of Russian citizens.[18][19] Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation are also supporting the separatists. DPR head Alexander Zakharchenko claimed in August 2014 that there were around 3,000 to 4,000 Russian volunteers fighting for his militia, which included serving and retired Russian Army servicemen.[20] It is alleged that since September 2015, the separatist units, at the battalion level and up, are acting under direct command of Russian Army officers, with former local commanders sometimes serving as their deputies.[21] On 3 March 2014, during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, groups of protesters took control of the regional administration building in Donetsk.[22] A newly created armed opposition group named the Donbas People's Militia, led by Pavel Gubarev, participated.[22] This happened when 11 Ukrainian cities with significant populations of ethnic Russians erupted in demonstrations against the new Ukrainian government.[22] On 6 April 2014, 2,000 pro-Russian protesters rallied outside the regional administration building.[23] On the same day, groups of protesters in Eastern Ukraine stormed the regional administration building in Kharkiv, and the SBU headquarters in Luhansk.[8] The groups created a people's council and demanded a referendum like the one held in Crimea.[23][nb 1] Within a few days, several government buildings in cities such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk were also stormed.[32][33] On 12 April, the supporters of the Donetsk People's Republic and members of Donbas People's Militia set up checkpoints and barricades in Sloviansk.[34][35][36] The same day, former members of the Donetsk \"Berkut\" unit joined the ranks of the Donbas People's Militia.[37] On 13 April, the newly established Ukrainian government gave the separatists a deadline to disarm or face a \"full-scale anti-terrorist campaign\" in the region.[38] Later that day, the first reports came in of fighting between the people's militia and Ukrainian troops near Sloviansk, with casualties on both sides.[39][40] On 14 April, members of the Donbas People's Militia blocked Ukrainian military KrAZ trucks armed with Grad missiles from entering the city.[41][42] On 15 April, a full scale \"Anti-Terrorist Operation\" was launched by the Ukrainian government with aim of restoring their authority over the areas seized by the militia.[43] On 16 April, the militia entered Sloviansk with six BMD airborne amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicles[45][46] they had obtained from elements of the 25th Airborne Brigade[47] who had switched allegiance.[48][49][50] A Ukrainian military column was disarmed after the vehicles were blockaded by locals in Kramatorsk.[51] The militia also received a 2S9 \"Nona-S\" self-propelled 120 mm mortar.[52][53] On April 20, an unidentified armed group in civilian clothes attacked a militia checkpoint at the entrance to the city of Sloviansk. Three attackers and three members of the militia were killed.[54] On May 14, eight members of the militia seized an IMR armored vehicle from Novokramatorsky Mashinostroitelny Zavod.[55] On May 15, the Donbas People's Militia sent an ultimatum to Kiev. They demanded the withdrawal of all Ukrainian troops from Donetsk oblast.[56] On May 17, several members of the militia seized two BRDM unarmed armored vehicles from Severodonetsk and Lysychansk (Luhansk Oblast)[57] On May 22, the Federal State of Novorossiya was declared. On May 23, several members of the people's militia seized another BRDM-RKh unarmed armored vehicle from Loskutovka (Luhansk Oblast)[58] In July 2014, the estimated manpower of the separatists was around 10,000 \u2013 20,000.[59][60] The militia were widely suspected to have been involved in the downing of a civilian airliner, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, on 17 July 2014.[61][62] On August 8, the militia claimed that after battles near the Russian border, they had captured 67 pieces of equipment in varying conditions (serviceable equipment without ammunition and fuel, with faults, damaged in battle and completely unusable), including 18 \"Grad\" multiple rocket launching systems, 15 tanks and armored personnel carriers, howitzers, MANPADS, etc.[63] As of August 12, the militia had at least 200 armored vehicles.[64] The months of July and early August were disastrous for the militias, with many analysts saying they were on the verge of defeat, before a sudden counteroffensive, which the Ukrainian government said was supported by Russian troops, encircled thousands of Ukrainian troops and forced them into a retreat.[65] The militias soon re-captured several strategic positions such as Savur-Mohyla and Luhansk International Airport.[66] The armies of both the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) merged on 16 September 2014 to form the \"United Armed Forces of Novorossiya\".[2][67] It was formed under the command of Lieutenant General Ivan Korsun as commander-in-chief.[68] On 2 February 2015, Head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko, announced that there would be a general mobilization in the DPR of 10,000 volunteers, and he aimed to eventually expand the NAF to 100,000 soldiers.[69] In March 2015, the estimated manpower of the separatists rose to 30,000 \u2013 35,000 personnel.[70] On 20 May 2015 the leadership of the Federal State of Novorossiya announced the termination of the confederation 'project'[71][72] but the United Armed Forces was retained as the joint armed service of the DPR and LPR.[73] The Ukrainian government in mid-2015 claimed there were about 42,500 fighters on the separatists' side, which include 9,000 Russian soldiers.[74] The militias consist of different armed groups, sworn to the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. Militant groups which refused to do so were disarmed as gangs in the DPR.[75] Other groups are autonomous forces.[76] According to The Ukrainian Week, a Donetsk Operative Command set up in May 2016 by Russia coordinates the military efforts of the Donetsk People's Republic.[77] The tank battalions they claim Russia can deploy include the DPR Diesel Battalion, and LPR August Battalion.[77] Euromaidan Press reported in September 2018 that the United Armed Forces of Novorossiya comprised two army corps: the 1st Corps, called the \"People's Militia of the DNR\" and the 2nd Corps, called \"People's Militia of the LNR\".[78] On 28 December 2018 commander of the Ukrainian Navy Ihor Voronchenko claimed that the DPR had created a flotilla stationed at Novoazovsk, made up of about 25 converted fishing boats.[79] According to Voronchenko, the DPR had named this flotilla the \"9th Regiment of the Marine Corps\".[79] DPR People's Militia (Russian: Народная милиция ДНР), or 1st Army Corps \u2013 Formed on 14 November 2014. LPR People's Militia (Russian: Народная милиция ЛНР), or 2nd Army Corps \u2013 Formed on 7 October 2014. Donbas People's Militia (Russian: Народное ополчение Донбасса) \u2013 Main militia of the Donetsk People's Republic from 3 March to 16 September 2014. Independent DPR forces (Mostly disbanded around 2014\u20132015) Army of the South-East (Russian: Армия Юго-Востока)[146][147][148][149] \u2013 Main militia forces of the Luhansk People's Republic from Mid April to 16 September 2014. Donetsk People's Republic Luhansk People's Republic According to Armament Research Services (ARES), the rebels mostly used equipment that was available domestically before the Ukrainian crisis. However, they were also seen with weapons that were not known to have been exported to Ukraine, or otherwise be available there, including some of the latest models of Russian military equipment, never exported outside Russia.[162] According to the Donetsk People's Republic, all of its military equipment is \"hardware that we took from the Ukrainian military\".[163] However, according to the Ukrainian government and the United States Department of State, this is a false. They claim the separatists have received military equipment from Russia, including multiple rocket launch systems and tanks.[6] Although Russian officials deny supplying arms to the militia, substantial evidence proves supports this.[162][6][164] In August 2014 Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey said the proof for the weapons supply from Russia was that the fighters of the Donbas People's Militia were using Russian-made weapons never used (or bought) by the Ukrainian army.[165] Such exclusively Russian equipment seen with pro-Russian separatists includes Russian modifications of T-72 tanks (particularly T-72B3 and T-72BA seen destroyed in Ukraine[162][166]), BTR-82AM infantry fighting vehicle (adopted in Russia in 2013),[167][168] BPM-97 armored personnel carriers,[169][170] sophisticated anti-aircraft system Pantsir-S1,[171][172] multipurpose vehicle GAZ Vodnik (adopted in Russia in 2005),[169] Russian modifications of MT-LB, rocket-propelled flamethrower MRO-A, anti-tank missile Kornet, anti-materiel rifle ASVK, suppressed sniper rifle VSS Vintorez and others.[162][167] The Donetsk Higher Combined Arms Command School (Russian: Донецкого высшего общевойскового командного училища) is a higher level institution in the ideological training of cadets.[173] People from both the DPR and LPR can enroll at the school.[174] It prepares future command cadres in four areas: reconnaissance, tank forces, infantry, and political officers.[clarification needed] Upon graduation, the cadets are commissioned as lieutenants. Since the fall of 2016, the Military Lyceum is affiliated to the DHCACS. The Georgy Beregovoy Military-Physical Training Lyceum (Russian: Лицей с усиленной военно-физической подготовкой имени дважды Героя Советского Союза, летчика-космонавта СССР, генерал-лейтенанта Г.Т.Берегового) is an educational facility of the People's Militia, being akin to the Suvorov Military School or the Ivan Bohun Military High School. It was established on 15 May 1993 by decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine as the Donetsk Higher Military-Political School of Engineering and Signal Corps. From 1993 to 2000, the Lyceum was with a three-year form of study. Over two decades, 2,793 graduates graduated from the institution, more than 1,000 of them currently serve in officer posts in various power structures of Ukraine.[175] It was renamed and converted in 2014; since then more than 300 students have graduated.[176] The school is open to boys between 14 and 16 years old, many of whom come from military families. The cadets live at the school six days a week.[177] As the conflict intensified, the Donbas People's Militia was bolstered with many volunteers from the former Soviet Union, mainly Russia; including fighters from Chechnya and North Ossetia.[178] According to the Ukrainian government and the United States Department of State the Donbas People's Militia has received military equipment from Russia, including Russian tanks and multiple rocket launchers.[6] Russia has denied supplying weapons and has described the Russian citizens fighting with the Donbas People's Militia as volunteers.[6][179] The Donetsk People's Republic claimed on 16 August 2014 that it had received (together with 30 tanks and 120 other armoured vehicles of undisclosed origin) 1,200 \"individuals who have gone through training over a four-month period on the territory of the Russian Federation\".[180][181] Prime Minister of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko said in August 2014 that it had not received military equipment from Russia; and all of its military equipment was \"hardware that we took from the Ukrainian military\".[163] Some injured militia members received medical care in Russia.[178] In mid-August 2014, hospitals such as the Donetsk Central Hospital in Donetsk, Russia tended to between ten and twenty injured fighters daily.[178] The Russian Emergency Ministry assisted with treatment logistics.[178] Those questioned and registered by the (Russian) Federal Security Service[178] and treated in Russia during this period stated that they would not return to Ukraine if the Ukrainian army won the Russo-Ukrainian War,[178] but would, instead, engage in a partisan warfare campaign in Eastern Ukraine.[178] According to a 2016 report by Institut français des relations internationales (IFRI), Russian ethnic and imperialist nationalism has shaped the official ideology of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.[182] During the War in Donbas, especially at the beginning, far-right groups played an important role on the pro-Russian side, arguably more so than on the Ukrainian side.[182][183] Afterward, the pro-Russian far-right groups became less important in Donbass and the need for Russian radical nationalists started to disappear.[182] According to Marlène Laruelle, separatist ideologues in Donbas produced an ideology composed of three strands of Russian nationalism: fascist, Orthodox, and Soviet.[183] Members and former members of the National Bolshevik Party, Russian National Unity (RNU), Eurasian Youth Union, and Cossack groups participated in starting branches for the recruitment of the separatists.[182][184][185][186] A former RNU member, Pavel Gubarev, was founder of the Donbas People's Militia and first \"governor\" of the Donetsk People's Republic.[182][187] RNU is particularly linked to the Russian Orthodox Army,[182] one of a number of separatist units described as \"pro-Tsarist\" and \"extremist\" Orthodox nationalists.[188][182] 'Rusich' is part of the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary group in Ukraine which has been linked to far-right extremism.[189][190] Some of the most influential nationalists and far-right activists among the Russian separatists are neo-imperialists, who seek to revive the Russian Empire.[182] These included Igor 'Strelkov' Girkin, first \"minister of defence\" of the Donetsk People's Republic, who espouses Russian neo-imperialism and ethno-nationalism.[182] The Russian Imperial Movement, a white supremacist militant group,[189] has recruited thousands of volunteers to join the separatists.[188] Some separatists have flown the black-yellow-white Russian imperial flag,[182] such as the Sparta Battalion. In 2014, volunteers from the National Liberation Movement joined the Donetsk People's Militia bearing portraits of Tsar Nicholas II.[184] According to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica, well-known Italian neo-fascist Andrea Palmeri (former member of the far-right New Force party) has been fighting for the Donetsk People's Republic since 2014 and was hailed by Gubarev as a \"real fascist\" when he joined the DPR militias.[191] Professor Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert on far-right movement in Russia and abroad, reported in 2014 that Polish neo-fascist group \"Falanga\", Italian far-right group \"Millennium\" and French Eurasianists had also joined the Donbas separatists.[192][193][194] Other Russian nationalist volunteers involved in separatist militias included members of the Eurasian Youth Union, and of banned groups such as the Slavic Union and Movement Against Illegal Immigration.[185] Another Russian separatist paramilitary unit, the Interbrigades, is made up of activists from the National Bolshevik (Nazbol) group Other Russia.[182] An article in Dissent noted that \"despite their neo-Stalinist paraphernalia, many of the Russian-speaking nationalists Russia supports in the Donbass are just as right-wing as their counterparts from the Azov Battalion\".[195] According to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, a number of European politicians from far-right and extreme-left receive all-expenses-paid visits to Donetsk.[196] In July 2015, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, said at a press conference that he respected Ukraine's far-right party Right Sector \"when they beat up the gays in Kyiv and when they tried to depose Poroshenko\".[197] While far-right activists played a part in the early days of the conflict, their importance was often exaggerated, and their importance on both sides of the conflict declined over time. The political climate in Donetsk further pushed far-right groups into the margins.[182] In April 2022, news outlets noted that a video posted on Donetsk People's Republic's website showed Denis Pushilin awarding a medal to Lieutenant Roman Vorobyov (Somalia Battalion), while Vorobyov was wearing patches affiliated with neo-Nazism: the Totenkopf used by the 3rd SS Panzer Division, and the valknut. However, the video did not show Vorobyov getting his medal when it was posted on Pushilin's website.[198][199] An 18 November 2014 United Nations report on eastern Ukraine stated that the DPR was in a state of \"total breakdown of law and order\".[200] The report noted \"cases of serious human rights abuses by the armed groups continued to be reported, including torture, arbitrary and incommunicado detention, summary executions, forced labour, sexual violence, as well as the destruction and illegal seizure of property may amount to crimes against humanity\".[200] In September 2015, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) published a report on the testimonies of victims held in places of illegal detention in Donbas.[201] In December 2015, a team led by Małgorzata Gosiewska published a comprehensive report on war crimes in Donbas.[202]","Title":"Russian separatist forces in Donbas - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15549","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_separatist_forces_in_Donbas"}
