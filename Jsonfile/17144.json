{"Content: ":"Phil Jackson (c.\u20091932 \u2013 20 July 2022)[1] was an English World Cup winning former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s and 1960s. He was a captain, playing as a centre, or stand-off, as well as a Barrow club legend. Jackson won 27 Great Britain caps, played in the 1954 and 1957 Rugby League World Cups and twice toured Australasia with the Lions.[2][3][4] Jackson was born in Canada but moved to Barrow-in-Furness, England, with his parents at the age of three. He played rugby league at school but his first senior rugby experience came in rugby union after he took up an apprenticeship at a shipyard. He switched to rugby league when he was offered professional terms by Barrow in 1950 at the age of 18. With Barrow, where he was known as the 'Prince Among Centres', he played in three Challenge Cup finals in the 1950s. Injury forced him to retire in 1959 but in 1960 he moved to Australia and was tempted back into playing by the Goulburn Workers Club in New South Wales.[5][6] In the role as player coach, he led the club to a Group 8 premiership.[7] The club was also awarded the Clayton Cup for being the best performed team in country New South Wales in 1960.[8] He continued coaching after retiring as a player and eventually settled in Wagga Wagga. He was inducted into the Barrow Hall of Fame when it was launched in 2001 alongside 1950s teammates Willie Horne and Jimmy Lewthwaite.
