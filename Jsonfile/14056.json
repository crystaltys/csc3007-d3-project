Naoshaad later joined the SLMC and became a member of the SLMC High Command.[2] At the 2004 parliamentary election, Naoshaad was a SLMC candidate in Ampara District but failed to get elected again after coming third amongst the SLMC candidates.[4][5] However, Naushad entered Parliament in April 2008 following the resignation of SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem.[4][6] Following a meeting at Temple Trees, Naushad defected from the SLMC to the governing United People's Freedom Alliance during the 2010 parliamentary election campaign and became a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.[7] He was subsequently made a UPFA candidate in Ampara District but failed to get elected after coming in eighth amongst the UPFA candidates.[8]","Title":"A.
