{"Content: ":"N1 is a 24-hour cable news channel launched on 30 October 2014. The channel has headquarters in Ljubljana, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb and covers events happening in Central and Southeastern Europe.[4] Available on cable TV throughout former Yugoslavia, N1 is CNN International's local broadcast partner and affiliate[5][6] via an agreement with the London-based Turner Broadcasting System Europe. As it is focused on the audiences of the three countries in which it is headquartered, it has three separate editorial policies, separate reporters, TV studios as well as internet and mobile platforms. In cases where news overlaps, it is presented jointly.[7][8] The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and Pauline Adès-Mével, a representative of Reporters Without Borders, described N1 as \u201cthe only big independent television station in Serbia\u201d.[9][10][11] Workers have been constantly labeled as \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201cforeign mercenaries\u201d and received hundreds of insults and threats of physical violence through social media.[12] Unidentified individuals sent a letter to the station on 4 February 2019 threatening to kill its journalists and their families and blow up its offices.[13] After Vučić was hospitalized with cardiovascular problems in November 2019, his associates and pro-regime media accused the N1 journalist Miodrag Sovilj of aggravating the President's health by probing allegations of corruption by government ministers.[14][15] The Council of Europe's platform on journalist safety warns about a lack of state response to intimidation, threats and a smear campaign against Sovilj.[16] The representative of Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about attacks faced by the Station\u2019s executive director, as well as about the distribution of leaflets advising N1 to leave Serbia and threats made via social networks.[11] In January 2020, the European Federation of Journalists associated itself with the Independent Association of Serbia\u2019s Journalists in supporting N1. It stated that it viewed the state-owned cable operator\u2019s decision to drop N1 as an attempt to shut down critical discourse in Serbia.[17] Parallel to the dispute between the United Group and cable operator, Harlem Désir, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and Reporters Without Borders both expressed concern over cyberattacks on N1\u2019s Serbian web portal and mobile app.[18][19] This article about a television station is a stub.
