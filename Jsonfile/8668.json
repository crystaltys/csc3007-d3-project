{"Content: ":"The 2022 UAE Tour was a road cycling stage race that took place between 20 and 26 February 2022 in the United Arab Emirates. It was the fourth edition of the UAE Tour and the opening race of the 2022 UCI World Tour.[1][2] All but one of the 18 UCI WorldTeams, and three UCI ProTeams, make up the 20 teams that are participating in the race.[3][4] Cofidis, the only UCI WorldTeam to not be participating in the race, declined their invitation, citing a full schedule.[5] Alpecin\u2013Fenix and Arkéa\u2013Samsic received automatic invitations as the best performing UCI ProTeams in the 2021 season,[6][7] but only the former accepted their invitation. The other two UCI ProTeams, Bardiani\u2013CSF\u2013Faizanè and Gazprom\u2013RusVelo, were selected by RCS Sport, the race organisers.[8] With many teams experiencing positive COVID-19 test results and having to withdraw riders and staff from competition,[9] only 10 teams were able to enter a full squad of seven riders, with a further seven teams entering six riders each. Intermarché\u2013Wanty\u2013Gobert Matériaux and Trek\u2013Segafredo were only able to enter five riders each, while Lotto\u2013Soudal was the only team to enter a squad of four riders. Gazprom\u2013RusVelo also had one late non-starter, reducing their squad to six riders.
