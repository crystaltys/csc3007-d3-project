{"Content: ":"There are 461 properties and historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in North Dakota. There are listings in 52 of North Dakota's 53 counties.  \u2003 \u2003 This National Park Service list is complete through NPS recent listings posted July 15, 2022.[1]  The following are approximate tallies of current listings by county. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008[2] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[3] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis.[4] Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number. The numbers of NRHP listings in each county are documented by tables in each of the individual county list-articles.","Title":"National Register of Historic Places listings in North Dakota - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3936","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_North_Dakota"}
