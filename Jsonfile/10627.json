{"Content: ":"The following is a timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malta. Notes: On 7 March, Malta reported its first three cases of coronavirus: an Italian family consisting of a 12-year-old girl and her parents, who arrived in Malta on 3 March from Rome after a holiday in Trentino. The girl was the first case, with the parents testing positive for the coronavirus later in the day. They had been in self-quarantine since arriving from Italy, and they were held in isolation at Mater Dei Hospital.[1] As of 8 March 2020, 540 tests have been carried out. This includes all those who were in contact with the infected family. Other than the family, all tested negative. Reports of other cases were dismissed as dissemination of false information.[2] A further 10 people were tested on 9 March with one result reported positive in the evening, bringing the overall number to four cases.[3] The man did not follow quarantine regulations for the first two days, which caused outrage among those possibly affected.[4] His daughter was found also positive, becoming the fifth case.[5] The fourth and fifth cases were reported as being Norwegians living in Malta.[citation needed] In the morning of 11 March, the sixth case of COVID-19 was confirmed with the patient being a Maltese man coming back from Italy. That same evening, the 7th case was confirmed and the patient was a relative of his who had travelled with him to Italy.[6][7] In the morning of 12 March, the 8th and 9th cases of the COVID-19 were confirmed.[9] By midday of 13 March, 889 tests had been carried out in Malta and consequently three further cases of COVID-19 were announced, bringing the total to 12.[10] All cases were imported from abroad. The 10th case was a Maltese man, 45, who returned from Münich on 6 March, the 11th case is an Italian man, 40, who returned from Paris on 6 March, and the 12th case was a Maltese woman, 30, who returned from Brussels on 9 March.[11] Later in the day, the first recovery form the virus in Malta was reported.[citation needed] As of 14 March there were 18 cases.[12] On 15 March, three further cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in Malta, bringing the total to 21.[13] In total 1,385 tests had been carried out, split between 722 tests on people who came from abroad and showed symptoms, and 663 tests on people who did not go abroad but displayed some sort of symptoms.[14] On 13 and 15 March, the first and second cases recovered from the COVID-19 coronavirus in Malta. The two individuals were to remain under quarantine in view of the revelations that the virus can re-emerge within survivors.[15] [16] On 16 March, Malta's COVID-19 cases have risen to 30 with nine new cases being recorded overnight, Public Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci said on Monday. Three of the cases were local transmission after people who came from holidays abroad infected co-workers. The three local transmissions were healthcare professionals, who contracted the virus from other healthcare workers who tested positive after returning from holiday.[17] The imported cases are of a 56-year-old Maltese woman who returned from the UK, a 34-year-old Maltese man who was on holiday in Barcelona with another person who had tested positive, a 15-year-old Spanish boy who was stopped at the airport with a group of friends, who are now in quarantine, a 49-year-old Italian woman who lives in Malta and whose husband returned from Rome, a 39-year-old man from the UK who lives in Malta and a 19-year-old Maltese teenager who was with the same group that returned from Dublin and who tested positive in previous days.[17] At noon, on 17 March, in a press briefing, the Maltese health authorities confirmed 8 further cases of the COVID-19, bringing the total to 38.[18] Of these last 8 cases, two were in contact with other people with coronavirus, four returned from abroad but put themselves into quarantine after their arrival to Malta, one of them work together with someone who was returning from Italy but who was not presenting symptoms, and the last one is unsure where he could get the virus because he did not travel and was not in contact with anybody with the virus. They found out that this last case was going to the gym, and he could have gotten it there.[19] At midday on 18 March, ten new cases were reported, including, for the first time, two patients aged over 70. All the patients are doing well.[20][21] On 19 March, only five new cases were reported.[22] At noon, on 20 March 11 new cases of coronavirus patients were reported. These included the case of a 61-year-old man, who was the first Maltese case of a COVID-19 patient who developed complications of the infection.[23][24][25] On 21 March, nine new cases were reported. These cases were an Indian national, 30, residing in Malta; unemployed, no travel history: he was in contact with a travel-related case, a Maltese woman, 49, who had contact with another person already positive with coronavirus contracted through travel. She reported symptoms on 19 March; two household members live with her, A school worker, she last worked there on 2 March. No risk of contagion for those who worked with her, a Maltese migrant to Australia who went into self-quarantine after travelling here from London also reported fever. Households members are under quarantine, a 25-year-old Maltese woman who returned from the UK to Malta. She then went into self-quarantine on her own in an apartment. Consequently, contact-tracing of those on the flight home was done. A Maltese national, 55, with no travel history and no symptomatic contacts, reported symptoms 14 March with fever and muscle pain. He worked on 13 March, a day before symptoms emerged. Contact tracing ongoing, a woman whose relative reported being ill after returning from England. She reported symptoms on 19 March. She last reported attending university on 10 March. This case was contained and controlled by the authorities, with household members also being tested. A foreign national in Malta, 41, who was not in contact with people living abroad was also amongst those reported, yet there is no clear indication of how this local transmission occurred. Contact tracing of workmates was being actioned. A Somali person who works in Malta, 44 years old, who flew to Brussels between 15 and 18 March, reported fever and chest pain. He reported to Mater Dei the day before after being in self-quarantine since he returned to Malta.[26] On 22 March, seventeen new cases were reported. 10 of the 17 cases were believed to be related to travel, while the other 7 were believed to be locally transmitted. Among the patients were an 18-year-old Maltese woman and a 37-year-old Maltese man, both of whom travelled to the UK; a 50-year-old Swedish man and 22-year-old Maltese man, whom both travelled to northern Italy; a Hungarian youth who is believed to have contracted the virus from his father; a 24-year-old Finnish youth who travelled to Vienna; a 51-year-old Maltese man who travelled to Morocco; a woman who travelled to Belgium, as well as a 46-year-old Maltese woman and another woman whose partner works in the tourism industry and is believed to have transmitted the virus to her.

All cases are local transmission, with the majority being foreigners and some linked to previous cluster and expected spread among immigrants living in crowded conditions.[43] One infected immigrant has supposedly fled from the police while being escorted to hospital.[44] However, this was the result of missing understanding as the person went back to the centre where he was receiving treatment by the Red Cross. He was later transferred to Boffa Hospital in Floriana.[44] Other immigrants at the centre were forcefully locked-in indefinitely (until coronavirus remains present) and safeguarded by the armed forces.[45] The situation is considered more desperate as residents inside the facility have to share bathrooms.[46] Two elderly people in a relationship were escorted to Malta from nearby offshore in a joint cooperation by the military and health authorities. They were required to stay in obligatory quarantine.[47] The first Maltese person to die took place in the UK, and it is not counted with the national statistics of Malta.[48] Meanwhile, amidst the Holy Week, the Archbishop played the harmonica.[49] On 7 April, the Minister for Health announced in an unusual early televised update that over 52 cases were found positive.
