All 8 counties in Connecticut have listings on the National Register. Fourteen of the sites are among historic sites along the route of French general Rochambeau's army in 1781 and 1782.  Fairfield (city of Bridgeport) (town of Greenwich) (city of Stamford) | Hartford (city of Hartford) (town of Southington) (town of West Hartford) (town of Windsor) | Litchfield | Middlesex (city of Middletown) | New Haven (city of New Haven) | New London | Tolland | Windham \u2003 \u2003 This National Park Service list is complete through NPS recent listings posted July 15, 2022.[1] The following are approximate tallies of current listings by county. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008[2] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[3] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis.[4] Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number. The numbers of NRHP listings in each county are documented by tables in each of the individual county list-articles.","Title":"National Register of Historic Places listings in Connecticut - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3909","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Connecticut"}
