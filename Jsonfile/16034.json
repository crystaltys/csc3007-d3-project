{"Content: ":"Lenta.ru (Russian: Лента.Ру; stylised as LƐNTA.RU) is a Russian-language online newspaper. Based in Moscow, it is owned by Rambler Media Group. In 2013, the Alexander Mamut-owned companies \"SUP Media\" and \"Rambler-Afisha\" merged to form \"Afisha.Rambler.SUP\", which owns Lenta.ru.[1] The online newspaper is one of the most popular Russian language online resources with over 600 thousand visitors daily.[2] In 1999 Anton Nosik launched Lenta.ru together with the Foundation for Effective Politics.[3] It was (like vesti.ru) a sister e-news project under the brand gazeta.ru.[4] Nosik served as its chief editor till 2004.[3] A Berkman Center 2010 study found it to be the most cited news source in the Russian blogosphere.[5] In 2013, Alexander Mamut through his ownership of the Afisha-Rambler-SUP Group acquitred Lenta.ru.[1] In 2013, Lenta.ru was ranked in 5th place in terms of traffic among European news sites by comScore-study.[6] In January 2013, the website was relaunched with a new design and significant changes to the rubricating system. This was the most serious update of the site since 2004.[7] In 2020, Mamut sold Rambler to Sberbank.[8] Following a March 10, 2014, Lenta.ru interview by Ilya Azar[a] of Andriy Tarasenko [uk][b] from the Right Sector's Kyiv branch,[9] Roskomnadzor immediately issued a press release on March 12, 2014,[10] in which Lenta.ru was implicated in violating numerous Russian media laws, information laws, and laws to counter extremism because the interview allowed a leader from the group to appeal to Ukrainian citizens to support pro-Ukraine causes and that the article contained a link to Dmytro Yarosh's March 1, 2014 appeal.[9][11][12][13][14][c] Since the warning by Roskomnadzor was the second issued in a 12-month period, Roskomnadzor would ask the courts to terminate Lenta.ru's mass media license.[10][13] Both the BBC and The Economist called Russia's response to Lenta.ru as censorship.[1][15] On March 12, 2014 the owner, Alexander Mamut, fired the Editor-in-Chief Galina Timchenko and replaced her with Alexey Goreslavsky. Thirty-nine employees out of the total 84, including Director-general Yuliya Minder, lost their jobs. This includes 32 writing journalists, all photo-editors (5 people) and 6 administrators.[16][17] The employees of Lenta.ru issued a statement that the purpose of the move was to install a new Editor-in-Chief directly controlled by the Kremlin and turn the website into a propaganda tool.[18] Dunja Mijatović, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, referred to the move as a manifestation of censorship.[19] Galina Timchenko, together with a team of around 20 journalists who resigned from their jobs at Lenta.ru, started the new internet newspaper Meduza.[citation needed] On the 9th of May 2022, the Russian Victory Day, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lenta.ru for a short time displayed information about the Russian warfare against Ukraine, in a way that did not comply with government regulations and also not with the enforced guidelines of Lenta.ru. There were articles about mass killing of civilians, looting, abandoned bodies of Russian troops, the destruction of Mariupol, censorship, governmental lies to relatives of diseased soldiers, oppression against the freedom of press and more. The Lenta.ru journalists Egor Polyakov and Alexandra Miroshnikova have stated that they were the authors of these articles, and have explained that they now need new jobs, lawyers, and political asylum. The content was quickly removed, but can be found in Wayback Machine.[20][21] In 2014, Lenta.ru received criticism by other journalists after the publication of an article analysing the ethnicity of the richest citizens of Russia; Nikolai Svanidze accused the publication of racism.[26] Lenta.ru has taken first place four times in the Rotor contest in the category \"Information site of the year\" and once, in 2000 in the category \"News site of the year\".[27][28] Maxim Moshkov has won the Rotor twice (in the categories \"Programmer of the Year\" in 1999 and \"Man of the Year\" in 2005).[29]","Title":"Lenta.ru - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16034","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenta.ru"}
