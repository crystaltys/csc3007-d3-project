{"Content: ":"A penguinarium is a vivarium for penguins intended to simulate aspects of their natural environment.[1] Penguinariums date back at least to 1968, when the Detroit Zoo opened the first in North America and possibly the world.[2][3] The Detroit penguinarium was expanded in 2015 with a US$21 million overhaul funded in part by a US$10 million donation - the largest in the zoo's history - from a single donor.[3] In April 2016, the Polk Penguin Conservation Center opened at the Detroit Zoo becoming the world's largest penguinarium.[4] However, the exhibit temporarily closed in 2019 for waterproofing repairs as the penguins were moved back into the 1968 exhibit. The conservation center reopened on February 14, 2022.[5] As of 2005, the world's second largest penguinarium was located on the Spanish island of Tenerife, where twelve tons of artificial snow were generated daily for the penguins at Loro Parque aquarium.[6]","Title":"Penguinarium - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12146","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguinarium"}
