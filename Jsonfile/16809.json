{"Content: ":"Vladimir Putin, current president of Russia, has owned seven dogs; since 2014, he has owned four dogs.[citation needed] His fondness of dogs has led to dogs becoming a notable political gift in Russian diplomatic relations.[1][2] When Putin took office, the Putin family had two poodles, Tosya and Rodeo. They reportedly stayed with his ex-wife Lyudmila after their divorce.[3] Konni (1999\u20132014) was a female black Labrador Retriever. Konni was born in 1999 and presented to Putin in December 2000. Konni was often seen at Putin's side, and was sometimes allowed to attend meetings when he greeted world leaders during visits to Russia. Putin was being updated on the progress of the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) in 2007 when he inquired whether he would be able to buy a device hooked into GLONASS that would allow him to keep track of his dog, Konni. The collar was demonstrated on Konni on 17 October 2008, thus making Konni the first recipient of a GLONASS-enabled pet collar.[4][5] Buffy, a caramel and white Bulgarian male 10-week-old shepherd Karakachan dog, was given to President Vladimir Putin during a visit to Bulgaria in November 2010 by Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.[6][7] The name 'Buffy' was chosen by a five-year-old boy during a nationwide competition.[8] Yume, a 3-month-old female Akita puppy, arrived in Moscow from Tokyo, Japan, in July 2012, as the Akita Prefecture's gift to show gratitude for assistance from Russia after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. 'Yume' means 'dream' in Japanese.[9][10][11] In 2016, the Japanese government offered Putin a male Akita puppy as a companion for Yume, but this gift was declined.[12][13] Verni was a birthday gift from Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, President of Turkmenistan, during a meeting in Sochi in October 2017. The puppy is an Alabai, a top Turkmen-bred variety of the Central Asia shepherd dog. 'Verni' means 'faithful' or 'loyal' in Russian.[14] Pasha (Serbian Cyrillic: Паша) is a Šarplaninac puppy that was given to Putin from Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić during an official visit in January 2019.[15][16]","Title":"Pets of Vladimir Putin - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16809","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets_of_Vladimir_Putin"}
