Most of them admitted that they performed the tasks of the Russian special services.[21][22][23] On April 11, sabotage groups were detained in the Kherson region, and on April 14, Russian GRU officers involved in inciting confrontation in the east were detained.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34] In May 2014, 8 saboteurs were detained. A group of extremists in the Kharkiv region and residents of Odesa who became mercenaries of the Russian secret services were exposed and stopped.[35][36][37][38] In June 2014, 6 saboteurs were exposed and detained.[39][40][41][42][43][44] In July 2014, the SBU detained 3 saboteurs and exposed sabotage and subversive groups in Donetsk and Odesa.[45][46][47][48] On October 20, 2014, the group, which acted on the scenario of the Russian secret services and was to carry out terrorist acts against Ukrainian high-ranking officials, was exposed.[49] In November 2014, law enforcement officers found a cache of weapons and detained two Ukrainian citizens who were investigating information for Russian special services in the Donetsk region.[50][51]","Title":"2014 Russian sabotage activities in Ukraine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16625","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Russian_sabotage_activities_in_Ukraine"}
