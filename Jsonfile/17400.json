{"Content: ":"Wuthering Heights is a modern-day adaptation of Emily BrontÃ«'s classic 1847 novel that aired on MTV in 2003 and was later released on DVD. It stars Erika Christensen, Mike Vogel, Christopher Masterson, Katherine Heigl, John Doe and Aimee Osbourne.[1] The screenplay was by Max Enscoe and Annie deYoung, from an original screenplay by Jim Steinman and Patricia Knop. Although set in California, the filming location was Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The executive producer was Jim Steinman. It features his song \"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\", which originally appeared on Original Sin, the concept album he wrote and produced for Pandora's Box. Wuthering Heights is one of Steinman's favourite books, and it was the inspiration for his song \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now.\"[2] The original soundtrack album (produced by Steinman, except where indicated below) was co-released by Ravenous Records and the MTV Original Movies label in November 2003. The track list is: \"If It Ain't Broke (Break It)\" and \"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\" were both recorded by Meat Loaf for his 2006 album Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. The latter had previously appeared on the Steinman-produced 1989 concept album Original Sin, by Pandora's Box. \"More\" was originally written and recorded for The Sisters of Mercy's 1990 album Vision Thing.
