{"Content: ":"The Platytrochozoa are a proposed basal clade of spiralian animals as the sister group of the Gnathifera. The Platytrochozoa were divided into the Rouphozoa and the Lophotrochozoa.[1] A more recent study suggests that the mesozoans also belong to this group of animals, as sister of the Rouphozoa.[2] Gnathifera Gastrotricha Platyhelminthes Mesozoa Lophotrochozoa An alternative phylogeny was given in 2019, with a basal grouping of Mollusca and Entoprocta named Tetraneuralia, and a second grouping of Nemertea and Platyhelminthes named Parenchymia as sister of Annelida. In this proposal, Lophotrochozoa would become roughly synonymous with Platytrochozoa, and Rouphozoa would be unsupported.[3]  This protostome-related article is a stub.
