{"Content: ":"The following is a timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The COVID-19 pandemic in Japan can be divided into five waves based on the genome sequence of the country's COVID-19 virus.[1][2][3][4] The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan) (NIID) has determined from its genetic research that the COVID-19 variant of the first wave is derived from the Wuhan type that is prevalent in patients from China and East Asia. After entering Japan in January through travellers and returnees from China, the virus resulted in numerous infection clusters across the country before moving towards its disappearance in March. Japanese medical surveillance confirmed its first case of the virus on 16 January in a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture who had returned from Wuhan.[5][6] The first wave was followed by a second one that originated from a COVID-19 variant of the European type that is traced back to early patients from France, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.[2][4] Japanese medical surveillance detected the second wave on 26 March when the government's expert panel concluded the likelihood of a new outbreak caused by travellers and returnees from Europe and the United States between 11 March and 23 March.[7] The NIID has established that the majority of viruses spreading in Japan since March is the European type. This has led it to conclude that the data \"strongly suggests\" that the Japanese government has succeeded in containing the Wuhan variant and that it is the European variant that is spreading across the country.[8] On 16 January, Kanagawa Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19 when a man in his 30s who had previously travelled to Wuhan tested positive for it, marking the first confirmed case in Japan.[6][5] On 24 January, Tokyo Metropolis confirmed its first case of COVID-19.[9] The Japanese government announced that it would provide repatriation services for all Japanese citizens in Hubei Province on that same day. Officials negotiated with Chinese authorities to dispatch five chartered flights to Wuhan from 29 January to 17 February.[10] On 27 January, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe designated the novel coronavirus as a \"designated infectious disease\" under the Infectious Diseases Control Law [ja]. He also designated the disease as a \"quarantinable infectious disease\" under the Quarantine Act.[11] On 30 January, Abe announced the establishment of a national task force to oversee the government's countermeasures against the novel coronavirus.[12][13] On 28 January, Nara Prefecture and Hokkaido Prefecture confirmed their first cases of COVID-19.[14][15] On 29 January, Osaka Prefecture reported its first case on January 29,[16] followed by Mie Prefecture and Kyoto Prefecture on 30 January,[17][18] and Chiba Prefecture on 31 January.[19] On 1 February, a passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship who had disembarked in Hong Kong on 25 January tested positive for COVID-19.[20] The ship received quarantine orders from the Japanese government in Naha on that same day.[20] The 80-year-old passenger from Hong Kong, China, had embarked in Yokohama on 20 January. He had been in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China on 10 January, then returned to Hong Kong and flew to Tokyo on 17 January to board the ship.[21][circular reference] On 3 February, the Japanese government announced entry restrictions for all foreign citizens who had had a travel history to and from Hubei Province or had a Chinese passport issued from there.[22] The Diamond Princess arrived at Yokohama and was placed under quarantine by the Japanese government on the same day.[23][24] On 5 February, the Japanese government announced that several passengers of the Diamond Princess had tested positive for COVID-19.[25][26] On 12 February, the Japanese government announced entry restrictions for all foreign citizens who had a travel history to and from Zhejiang Province or had a Chinese passport issued from there.[27] On 13 February, Wakayama Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19. A woman in her 80s died in Kanagawa Prefecture on that same day, marking the first death from COVID-19 in Japan and the third death globally outside mainland China.[28][29] On 14 February, Okinawa Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19.[30] Aichi Prefecture reported its first case on 15 February.[31] On 19 February, the Japanese government completed testing 3,011 passengers on the Diamond Princess.[32] On 20 February, Saitama Prefecture and Fukuoka Prefecture confirmed their first cases of COVID-19.[33] Ishikawa Prefecture and Kumamoto Prefecture reported their first cases on 21 February, followed by Tochigi Prefecture on 22 February, Nagano Prefecture and Tokushima Prefecture on 25 February, and Gifu Prefecture on 26 February.[34] On 21 February, the Japanese government began disembarking passengers from the Diamond Princess.[35] On 23 February, the US State Department raised its travel alert for Japan to level 2 on the four-level advisory scale due to the \"sustained community spread\" of COVID-19 within the country.[36] On 27 February, Shinzo Abe requested the closure of all elementary, junior high, and high schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April.[37][38] On 28 February, Hokkaido Prefecture declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and requested its residents to refrain from going outside.[39] Shizuoka Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on that same day.[40] On 29 February, Miyagi Prefecture, Kochi Prefecture, and Niigata Prefecture confirmed their first cases of COVID-19.[41] On 1 March, Hyogo Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19.[42] Ehime Prefecture reported its first case on 2 March,[43] followed by Oita Prefecture on 3 March,[44] Yamaguchi Prefecture[45] and Miyazaki Prefecture on 4 March,[46] Shiga Prefecture on 5 March,[47] Akita Prefecture[48] and Yamanashi Prefecture on 6 March,[49] and Hiroshima Prefecture,[50] and Gunma Prefecture on 7 March.[51] On 2 March, nearly all prefectures began shutting schools Monday in a bid to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus in Japan, four days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe surprised many with a request for schools to be closed countrywide until early April.[52] By paying up to 8,330 yen ($77) a day per worker for paid leave between Feb. 27 and March 31, the ministry hopes to help companies compensate workers for income losses.[52] Furthermore, the criteria for employment subsidies have been eased for those that have been affected by the pneumonia-causing virus to include non-regular employees as well.[52] On 4 March, The Japan High School Baseball Federation said Wednesday it is preparing to hold the national high school baseball invitational tournament behind closed doors due to the spread of the new coronavirus, while also mulling possible cancellation of the meet.[53] On 5 March, Japan announced quarantine restrictions for all visitors arriving from China and South Korea.[54] On 6 March, the South Korean government protested the restrictions by suspending visas for all Japanese citizens travelling to South Korea.[55] On 6 March, Some e-learning program providers are offering their services for free to help students keep up with their studies while schools in Japan remain closed over the coronavirus outbreak.[56] Major comic book publishers, meanwhile, are taking the same step to keep students entertained, with the government calling on students to remain indoors before schools reopen in early April at the earliest.[56] On 10 March, Japan on Tuesday adopted a fresh 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) level emergency package for businesses battered by the new coronavirus outbreak, featuring 500 billion yen in zero-interest loans for small and midsize companies short of cash due to sharp falls in sales.[57] The stimulus measures, which entail 430.8 billion yen in actual spending under the fiscal 2019 budget, also include providing 4,100 yen a day in subsidies for freelance workers who are forced to give up work to take care of their children amid school closures following the outbreak.[57] On 10 March, the Japanese government categorized the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Japan as a historical emergency situation.[58][59][60] Additionally, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday requested that big sports and cultural events in Japan be canceled or postponed for 10 more days as the government needs more time to gauge the effectiveness of its measures to contain the new coronavirus.[61] On 13 March, Saga Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19.[62] Nagasaki Prefecture reported its first case on 14 March,[63] followed by Ibaraki Prefecture[64] and Kagawa Prefecture[65] on 17 March, and Fukui Prefecture on 18 March.[66] On 16 March, the Japanese government announced it would expand entry restrictions to all foreign citizens arriving from four additional countries. The restrictions applied to three areas in Spain (including Madrid), four areas in Italy (including the northern region of Liguria), Switzerland's Ticino region, and all of Iceland.[67] On 19 March, the governors of Osaka and Hyogo prefectures asked residents to avoid nonessential travel between the two neighbouring prefectures over the three-day weekend starting on 20 March to contain the spread of the coronavirus.[68][69] The three-week state of emergency in Hokkaido was lifted on that same day.[70] On 22 March, Okayama Prefecture confirmed its first case of COVID-19 and requested its residents to refrain from visiting the neighboring prefectures of Hyogo and Osaka.[71][72] Aomori Prefecture reported its first case on 23 March,[73] followed by Gifu Prefecture on 26 March.[74] On 23 March, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warned residents that a lockdown might be the only way against the disease if infections were to surge in Tokyo as she urged people to cooperate with government countermeasures.[75][76][77] On 24 March, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games announced a one-year postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics.[78] On 25 March, MHLW officials announced 71 people tested positive,[79] including 41 cases in Tokyo.[80] Governor Yuriko Koike held an emergency press conference in the late afternoon. She said that \"the current situation is a serious situation where the number of infected people may explode.\" Koike also asked \"if possible, work at home and refrain from going out at night as much as possible on weekdays.\" Koike asked people returning from abroad to refrain from going out for 14 days.[81] The request from the governor appears to have punctured the relaxed mood in Tokyo. Panic buying began to trend on Twitter, with users posting pictures of empty shelves and lines outside supermarkets. At the Don Quijote store in Nakameguro, customers hurried to grab instant noodles and canned goods immediately following Koike's late-evening speech.[82] On 26 March, several governors of the Greater Tokyo Area, including Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Yamanashi, strongly urged residents to follow stay-at-home requests to prevent a surge in infections that could cause a \"critical phase\".[83] In Tokyo, residents were asked to work from home and refrain from going out at night and on the weekend.[84] On 27 March, MHLW officials announced 112 people had tested positive in a single day, including three Hanshin Tigers professional baseball players.[85][86] On 28 March, Abe held an hour-long press briefing about the economic measures being prepared by the Japanese government[87][88] amid considerable concerns of an \"explosive spread of overflowing infections\", which was creating regional self-isolation requests around Japan, including in Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo, and Aichi.[89] Abe's wife became the centre of controversy when she was accused of attending a hanami party during the pandemic. Abe denied the claim and said she merely took pictures in front of some cherry trees after going to a restaurant.[90] On 29 March, MHLW officials announced 194 people had tested positive for the virus, including 58 people at a facility for the disabled in Tōnoshō, Chiba Prefecture, and 63 in Tokyo.[91] However, a Tokyo municipal government official acknowledged by the end of the day that 63 people in the city tested positive for COVID-19 on 28 March and that a record number of 68 people tested positive on 29 March.[92] It was also revealed that Tokyo now had 430 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the largest among Japan's 47 prefectures.[92] On 30 March, it was announced that tarento and comedian Ken Shimura had died at the age of 70 from complications of a COVID-19 infection. This marked the first major death from the pandemic in Japan's entertainment industry.[93][94][95] On 30 March, Fukuoka City announced confirmed cases in a woman in her 20s and her infant daughter.[96] On 30 March, Toyama prefecture announced its first case,[97] and a Kyoto government official announced that the Kyoto Sangyo University had undergone \"a cluster of infections\"\u2014including two students who had recently returned from travel to Europe.[98][99][100] By 31 March, calls were being made for Abe to declare a state of emergency.[101][102] However, Abe and Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga denied that a state of emergency was immediately necessary.[103] As of 31 March, Tokyo on Tuesday reported a record daily increase of 78 new infections, raising its total to 521.[104] Of that number, 10 cases are from what authorities believe is a cluster infection at Eiju General Hospital in Taito Ward.[104] Tokyo reported seven deaths among infected residents Tuesday.[104] On 1 April, The government established Wednesday a team within the secretariat of the National Security Council tasked with crafting Japan's strategic response to the coronavirus crisis while improving its competitiveness in the technology and economic spheres.[105] Specifically, the team is planned to focus on overcoming the novel coronavirus epidemic as well as driving Japan's development in the fields of artificial intelligence and 5G wireless, especially in the face of the United States' and China's race for supremacy in the technologies.[105] The Immigration Services Agency of Japan said Friday it will extend for three months the deadline for foreigners to renew their period of stay in a bid to alleviate congestion at immigration counters amid the coronavirus outbreak.[106] At present, immigration counters nationwide are crowded with foreigners, including short-term stayers, who are applying for extensions of their stay in Japan, with some of them unable to return home due to tighter border control across the globe.[106] On 3 April, Japan expanded its entry ban, effectively barring entrance to the country for visitors from 73 countries and regions.[107] On 4 April, at least 118 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in Tokyo on Saturday, the first time the daily increase has topped 100, the metropolitan government said, in a development that could raise pressure on Japan to declare a state of emergency.[108] Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had been widely seen as cautious about declaring an emergency despite spiking infections in urban areas like Tokyo and Osaka and growing calls from medical experts to do so due to fears the country's health care system could collapse.[108] On 6 April, The Tokyo metropolitan government on Monday reported 83 new coronavirus cases following two days of three-digit increases, as it continues to grapple with a recent spike in the number of infections.[109] The metropolitan government planned to begin transferring patients with mild or no symptoms from hospitals to designated hotels and other lodging facilities on Tuesday as it wants to prioritize treatment for patients with severe symptoms.[109] On 7 April, Abe proclaimed a state of emergency from 8 April to 6 May for Tokyo and the prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka. He also said there would be no lockdown like in other countries, and that public transportation and other services needed to keep the economy and society going would be maintained as much as possible.[110] This was the first emergency declaration in Japan.[111][112] Abe also stated that the pandemic had created the nation's greatest economic crisis since the end of World War II.[113] On 8 April, Tokyo confirmed 144 new coronavirus infections Wednesday, a record daily high, metropolitan government officials said.[114] Of the 144 infections confirmed Wednesday, 95, or more than 60 percent, had no clear infection routes, the officials said.[114] The total number of infections confirmed in Tokyo now stands at 1,338, with 1,231 people hospitalized and 35 deaths from the pneumonia-causing virus as of Tuesday evening.[114] On 9 April, Kiminobu Okada (岡田公伸), an executive of Mainichi Broadcasting System in Osaka, died due to coronavirus in Nishinomiya.[115][116] On 10 April, Nippon Professional Baseball and the pro soccer J-League on Friday abandoned plans to play in April, while declining to say when their coronavirus pandemic-affected seasons could resume.[117] Prior to their internal meetings on Friday, NPB executives and their J-League counterparts met with a panel of medical experts in the fifth sitting of the task force they jointly formed to keep abreast of the health crisis.[117] On 11 April, A total of 197 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in Tokyo on Saturday, a record daily increase for the fourth straight day, the metropolitan government said.[118] The figure topped the previous record of 189 marked Friday, bringing the total number of infections in the capital to more than 1,900.[118] The latest figure for the pneumonia-causing virus infection in the capital comes as these prefectures entered their first weekend under a state of emergency.[118] Narita International Airport closed one of its two runways on 12 April due to an 85 percent reduction in traffic caused by the virus.[119][120] A second wave of infections hit Hokkaido, prompting the prefectural government to declare a second state of emergency that closed schools and that asked residents to avoid non-essential trips.[70] On 16 April, the Japanese government expanded the state of emergency to include all 47 prefectures in Japan.[121] The government also announced a plan to give 100,000 yen to every registered resident of Japan.[122] On 19 April, first coronavirus death in Chūgoku region was reported due to disease outbreak of COVID-19 in Hiroshima Prefecture.[123] On 20 April, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 25 people died in a single day, the highest number of daily nationwide confirmed fatalities.[124] On 21 April, former chairman of Omron Yoshio Tateishi (立石義雄) died due to COVID-19 in Kyoto, according to the Omron website.[125][126] On 23 April, 29 persons nationwide were confirmed to have died, including actress Kumiko Okae (岡江久美子)[127][128][129] and actor Shu Wada (和田周), according to a JMIAC confirmed report.[130][131] According to a National Police Agency of Japan confirmed report, 73 police officers had tested positive since February, and there were an additional 15 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 from March found in people who had died outside hospitals, mainly most of people who were homeless and had been tested after death due to limited testing.[132] On 27 April, minister Yasutoshi Nishimura was criticized for getting tested for the virus before other people who were showing symptoms. He took the test after a person in the response team he is part of tested positive for the virus, though he claimed to have not been in direct contact with the infected person.[133] On 30 April, PM Abe announced on Thursday that Japanese authorities are struggling to increase testing to those suspected of being infected with coronavirus.[134] On 1 May, smaller towns and villages began distributing the 100,000 yen stimulus payment to residents. Larger municipalities are expected to follow suit within the next two months.[135] On 3 May, at the event held by the Japanese conference, Prime Minister Abe announced through a video that he intends to revise Japan's peace constitution in order to deal with the resolute infectious disease.[136][137][138] On this topic, the Constitutional Democratic Party leader Yukio Edano underscored Japan has the basic law on disaster management that also restricts private rights during the time of emergency and allows authorities to implement essential measures, saying the law can be applied in efforts to contain the coronavirus.[136][138] At a news conference on Friday, Democratic Party for the People leader Yuichiro Tamaki expressed that even after the coronavirus situation has calmed down, the constitutional amendment can proceed in a quiet environment.[137] Komeito, the LDP \u2019s coalition partner, is also cautious about hasty talks on revising the Constitution. \u201cIt \u2019s important to hold discussions on constitutional issues in a calm manner,\u201d Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said on Thursday.[137] On 4 May, the Japanese government decided to extend the nationwide state of emergency established in April until the end of May.[139] The prime minister said the number of new infections have slowed in recent days, but not enough to lift the state of emergency.[140] The Japanese government urged citizens in Japan to adopt a \"new lifestyle\" for a protracted fight against coronavirus, even after society begins to shift back to its normal state. The prime minister also stated that the government will reassess the situation after a meeting with members of its expert panel around May 14.[141] As of 6 May, before Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura announced his own standards for Osaka Prefecture, which is named as \"Osaka model\", he expressed his desire for the Japanese government to clearly describe the requirements to lift the state of emergency.[142][143] Later, Minister Nishimura said that the comments were somewhat confusing and that he would set standards later.[142][143] Later, Yoshimura changed the critical tone of the remarks and apologize to the Minister Nishimura, on Twitter.[143] However, he expressed his anxiety and disappointment with the government, strongly stating that he would reveal his beliefs as a politician.[143] On 7 May, schools in the lightly affected prefectures of Aomori and Tottori were reopened after closing following the nationwide emergency declaration.[144] On 8 May, The Japanese health ministry on Friday relaxed its guidelines for giving coronavirus tests to people who have developed a symptom of infection, scrapping the rigid fever rule which has been criticized for denying many potential patients access to the tests.[145] At his May 8 news conference, health minister Katsunobu Kato explained that various directives were issued to prefectural governments about the guidelines after complaints about the difficulty in receiving a PCR test.[146] The Tōhoku region had its first reported death due to the virus on 9 May after a man in his eighties from Miyagi Prefecture died.[147] On 9 May, Economic and fiscal policy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said that the government may lift the emergency for some prefectures before its expiration.[148] Later on 10 May, Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Kato Katsunobu referred to employment subsidies for businesses that do not fire their employees despite a drop in sales.[149] On 11 May, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced plans to approve a COVID-19 Antigen Test Kit that produces results more quickly than the current PCR test.[150][151] On that same day, Yuriko Koike revealed that there was a miscount of confirmed infection which led to the inaccurate statistics falsely, as there were overlapping figures gathered during the overloaded paperwork.[152] In the midst of this, criticism and concern are growing as there is not enough discussion about increasing the supply of the coronavirus test, and the issue of the extension of the retirement age of the prosecutor Kurokawa is being led by the Abe Cabinet.[153][154][155] Yukio Edano insisted that it was not right for the Japanese government to push the bill through turmoil during a disaster like a thief in a fire scene.[156] A few days later, Japanese Government and Abe Cabinet declared that they would rescind the legal change of prosecutor's retirement.[157][158][159] On 14 May, Japanese government officials and PM Shinzo Abe declared that they had decided to suspend the emergency of 39 prefectures, except for 4 prefectures in Kanto, 3 prefectures in Kinki, and Hokkaido, which are feared of collapse of medical system.[160][161] At the press conference, Prime Minister Abe urged to be vigilant even if the emergency was lifted, citing examples from South Korea, Germany, and Singapore as comparison targets.[162][163] It was the day after the news was reported widely that a sumo wrestler in his 20s died after suffering from a viral infection for a month.[164][165] On 18 May, it was officially reported around the global market that Japan's economy officially enters recession with 'Much worse' expected from coronavirus for first time since 2015.[166][167] On 21 May, the state of emergency is lifted in 3 prefectures in the Kinki region after they had cleared the threshold of having new infections below 0.5 per 100,000 people in the past week, resulting a total of 42 out of the 47 prefectures to be out of the state of emergency.[168] On 24 May, Fukuoka Prefecture announced a total of four confirmed cases, including one re-positive case confirmed in Fukuoka City, and three infected cases related to Kitakyushu City.[169][170] On 25 May, PM Shinzo Abe has announced he's lifting the government's emergency declaration for the five prefectures where it's still in place.[171] On 28 May, a 117.1 trillion yen relief package was approved by Abe and his cabinet.

Tokyo reported 107 new cases of the novel coronavirus Thursday, an alarming uptick that residents fear may push the central government to declare another state of emergency.[266][267][268] It was the

Among recent cases, many of the infected are young people in their 20s and 30s and those who have visited the nightlife areas in the capital, with many remaining asymptomatic.[272] But despite the

others.[320] The Asahi Shimbun reported on the 12 July that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered \"consulting with Taiwan first\" to avoid criticism from conservatives over the easing of entry regulations for Korean and Chinese businessmen in connection with the \"COVID-19 infection incident.\"[321] According to The Asahi Shimbun, when the Japanese government decided in June to ease entry restrictions for officials from companies in four countries\u2014Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand\u2014a kind of agreement was reached within the government: \"South Korea, China and Taiwan next.\"[321] Abe then ordered Taiwan to do so first in relation to countries subject to the second round of entry deregulation.[321] The Asahi Shimbun analysed that the prime minister's supporters expect a hard-line stance against South Korea and China.[321] Against this backdrop, a policy of \"starting negotiations almost simultaneously, but ending negotiations in Taiwan\" has emerged.[321] It also decided to \"water down\" Korean, Chinese and Taiwanese issues, which have drawn keen attention, by including Asian countries such as Brunei, Myanmar and Malaysia, where the COVID-19 is stable.[321] Accordingly, the Japanese government plans to begin consultations with 10 countries, including South Korea, in the middle of this month on easing immigration restrictions.[321] The opposition party immediately ordered the government to \"re-declare the emergency.\"[322] Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, said, \"If the infection expands, it will be a failure due to the failure of politics to do what it needs to do.[322] At least it is an objective situation to declare an emergency in Tokyo.\"[322] On the other hand, the Japanese government is sticking to the position of Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Thursday, saying, \"I don't think we're in a situation where we're going to announce an emergency again soon.\"[322] About 80 per cent of the confirmed patients are in their 20s and 30s, and the rate of bed use (about 20 per cent) is still available.[322] Above all, the Japanese government is concerned about the negative impact on the economy if the emergency declaration is accompanied by a request to refrain from going out or taking a break.[322] Some in the Japanese government said that it was Tokyo's problem.[322] Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a lecture in Chitose, Hokkaido on 11 July, \"It is no overstatement to say that the issue is Tokyo's problem undoubtedly.\" It's a Tokyo-centred problem,\" he said.[322] With hundreds of coronavirus infections in Japan for the fourth day in a row, the government has launched a campaign to encourage travelling domestically in Japan, raising concerns over the spread of the virus.[323] Japan's tourism agency announced the \"Go to Travel\" project on the 10 July, which will invest 1.6794 trillion yen in the government's supplementary budget.[323] The campaign, which will go into effect on the 22 July, aims to boost domestic consumption and offers discounts of up to 35 per cent on tourism, travel, transportation, restaurant and entertainment.[323] Local media, including NHK, also pointed out that \"in large cities such as Tokyo, where the number of infected people is increasing, there are voices concerned that the population movement will increase and spread.\"[323] Legal circles are recruiting plaintiffs and lawyers for class action suits against the project under the name of \"Stop Go To Travel.\"[323] As the controversy grew, Yastoshi Nishimura, Minister of Economic revitalization in charge of COVID-19 response, held a press conference on 12 July and explained, \"We must proceed with the campaign while paying attention to the spread of the infection. We can thoroughly prevent infection and promote the compatibility of economic and social activities.\"[323] He also stressed, \"If you are in bad shape, please refrain from going out, and refrain from crossing the prefecture.\"[323] As of 9 p.m. on 13 July, 261 new cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed in Japan.[324] The total number of infected people, combined with 409 for 12 days, was 22,318.[324] In Hokkaido, one woman in her 90s died and the total number of death has been reached 984.[324] A male public health nurse in her 30s dispatched from Kagawa Prefecture to Kumamoto Prefecture, which was hit by heavy rain, was found to have been infected.[324] It was said that he was involved in the operation of an evacuation center within the jurisdiction of Hitoyoshi Health Center on 12 July.[324] Until 12 July, 119 people were confirmed to have been infected in Tokyo for four consecutive days.[324] The Osaka prefectural government on Tuesday confirmed that 18 people were infected with the disease, which it called for vigilance by its own standards.[324] Twenty-six people were found to have been infected in Saitama Prefecture, and 17 in Chiba and Kanagawa Prefectures, respectively.[324] On 13 July, the metropolitan government and ward health centre thought that a cluster (infected group) had occurred in a theatre in Shinjuku, and started investigating the actual situation.[325] According to the event's organizers, 37 people are infected.[325] The health officials recommends that about 800 spectators, about 50 performers and staff members go through PCR tests for intense contacts.[325] The outbreak occurred at \"Shinjuku Theater Moliere\" from 30 June to 5 July \"THE JINRO-Who is the handsome wolf idol!-\".[325] The organizer, \u201cRise Communication\u201d (Tokyo), announced on the homepage that there were 37 performers, 16 performers, 5 staff and 16 spectators.[325] According to the theatre, the performances were held twice a day from 30 June to 5 July, and about half of the audience was in the approximately 130 square metres (about 190 seats).[325] Rise explained that the infection was confirmed in all performances, and said that it tried to prevent the infection by checking the temperature of the cast and wearing a mask.[325] Meanwhile, 32 US officials at the Futenma Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture were found to have been infected, and a total of 98 US soldiers were infected at five facilities.[325] Yamaguchi Prefecture also announced at the same day that there were several people who have been concerned to be contacted US military bases in Iwakuni confirmed positive COVID-19.[325] On 14 July, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government announced that 143 new coronavirus cases were reported.[326] The number of infected people fell below 200 a day in a row.[326] The total number of people infected was 8,189.[326] There were no reports of the dead.[326] By age group, 64 people were in their 20s, followed by 29 in their 30s.[326] It was 65% in their 20s and 30s.[326] Among those who know the route of infection, 21 were employees of restaurants and customers, 13 were in facilities such as nursery schools and kindergartens, 17 were in the workplace and 10 were in the home.[326] As of 11:15 p.m. on 14th, 333 new cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed in Japan.

The response is a matter of the government.\"[331] The 'Go-To campaign' is a tourism revitalization project actively pursued by the Abe government to promote domestic tourism demand, since Japan's tourism economy have been damaged by COVID-19 pandemic.[331] On 15 July, 165 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Tokyo.

infections the same day, its second consecutive day over 200, the metropolitan government said, a day after the nation set a single-day record for the most cases of the deadly virus.[359][360] Iwate, which had been the last prefecture to report no COVID-19 infections, confirmed its first two cases on Wednesday.[359][360] The figures announced this week have drawn much attention because they may reflect how the virus spread during a four-day holiday that started 22 July.[359][360] Other prefectures in the metropolitan area, as well as large cities across the nation, have seen a surging number of infections recently.[359][360] Japan marked on Thursday a second day of record infections of the novel coronavirus at 1,305 fresh cases nationwide, with Tokyo and other urban areas also reporting record numbers.[361][362] Tokyo reported a record 367 new cases on Thursday as the metropolitan government asked restaurants and karaoke bars to limit their operating hours amid worries over the recent spike in infections across Japan.[361][362] Tokyo Gov.
