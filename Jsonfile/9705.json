{"Content: ":"The Nuclear Threat Initiative, generally referred to as NTI, is a non-profit organization located in Washington, D.C. The American foreign policy think tank was founded in 2001 by former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn and describes itself as a \"nonprofit, nonpartisan global security organization focused on reducing nuclear and biological threats imperiling humanity.\"[1] NTI has four policy programs: the Global Nuclear Policy Program, Nuclear Materials Security, Scientific and Technical Affairs, and Global Biological Policy and Programs (stylized as NTI | bio).[2] NTI's self-described mission is \"to transform global security by driving systemic solutions to nuclear and biological threats imperiling humanity.\"[1] NTI was founded in 2001 by former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn and philanthropist Ted Turner.[3] The launch event was held at the National Press Club on January 8, 2001. An event celebrating NTI\u2019s 20th anniversary was held on April 12, 2022, with a one-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[4] NTI supported the development of an international low-enriched uranium bank to help prevent the proliferation of nuclear technology.[5] NTI advisor Warren Buffett provided $50 million to jump-start the reserve, which is owned and managed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and located in Kazakhstan.[5] The bank became fully operational in October 2019 after receiving its first shipment of uranium.[6] In 2002, NTI helped remove 100 pounds of highly-enriched uranium from a nuclear reactor in modern-day Serbia.[7] NTI provided technical and financial support to help convert 2,900 kilograms of highly-enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium in Kazakhstan in 2005.[8] The organization committed $1.3 million for reactor safety systems.[7] NTI has produced a biennial \"Nuclear Security Index\" in partnership with Economist Impact since 2012.[9] The \"NTI Index\" benchmarks nuclear security conditions across 176 countries.[10] As part of the Index, NTI also develops and releases a Radioactive Source Security Assessment that includes recommendations on securing and eliminating radiological sources used and stored at thousands of sites across more than 100 countries.[10] The Global Health Security Index, produced by NTI, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and Economist Impact, is a biennial index that assesses countries' preparedness to respond to pandemics and epidemics.[11] The GHS Index assesses 195 countries' abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies based on publicly available information.[12] In 2002, NTI partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to create a $500,000 rapid response fund for infectious disease outbreaks.[13] NTI regularly convenes meetings among global nuclear security experts and government officials to discuss issues related to nuclear security.[14] Global Dialogue summits have taken place in France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan.[15] In 2003, NTI created the Middle East Consortium for Infectious Disease Surveillance (MECIDS) with participation from Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority.[16] MECIDS shares official health data and conducts infectious disease prevention training. In 2008, NTI helped create the World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS), in Vienna, as part of its focus to secure nuclear materials worldwide.[17] NTI also created Connecting Organizations for Disease Surveillance (CORDS), which launched in 2013 as an independent NGO that links international disease surveillance networks, supported by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.[18] The organization produced the 2005 film, Last Best Chance, a docudrama about nuclear terrorism that aired on HBO.[19] NTI also produced the 2010 documentary film Nuclear Tipping Point, which was screened by President Obama at the White House in April 2010[20] and featured on the Colbert Report.[21] Ernest J. Moniz has served as chief executive officer since June 2017, and Joan Rohlfing serves as president and chief operating officer.[22] Co-chaired by Moniz, Nunn, and Ted Turner, NTI is governed by a Board of Directors with both current and emeritus members from around the globe. NTI receives funding from a number of sources, including foundations, individuals, non-U.S. governments, and corporations.[23] Funders and financial information are listed in NTI\u2019s annual report, which is published online each year. The organization does not accept U.S. government funding.[24]","Title":"Nuclear Threat Initiative - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9705","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Threat_Initiative"}
