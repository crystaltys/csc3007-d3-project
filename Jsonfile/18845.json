{"Content: ":"Bill Porter (born October 3, 1943) is an American author who translates under the pen-name Red Pine (Chinese: 赤松; pinyin: Chì Sōng). He is a translator of Chinese texts, primarily Taoist and Buddhist, including poetry and sūtras. In 2018, he won the American Academy of Arts & Letters Thornton Wilder Prize for translation.[1] In an interview with Andy Ferguson for Tricycle Magazine in 2000, Bill Porter revealed some of the details of his early life. [2] Red Pine's father, Arnold Porter, grew up on a cotton farm in Arkansas. At an early age, he became part of a notorious bank robbing gang that robbed banks from the south northwards to Michigan. In a shoot out with the police, all the gang members were killed except Arnold who was wounded and subsequently sent to prison. Nevertheless, after six years he was pardoned by the governor of Michigan and released; an inheritance from the sale of the family farm allowed him to enter the hotel business and to become a multimillionaire. Arnold moved to Los Angeles, where Bill was born in 1943. Later the family moved to a mountainous area near Coeur D\u2019Alene Idaho. Arnold Porter became involved in Democratic Party politics and head of the Democratic Party in California, developing close associations with the Kennedy family. Bill Porter\u2019s early life was one of wealth and privilege. He and his siblings were sent to elite private schools, but Bill considered the schools to be phony and too wrapped in wealth, ego, and power. Eventually Bill\u2019s father divorced his mother and subsequently they lost everything. While his brother and sister found it difficult to live with less money, Bill was relieved when this happened. Bill served in Germany for three years as a medical clerk, with the GI Bill paid for his college education at UC Santa Barbara where he obtained a degree in anthropology. When he encountered Buddhism, the tenets were quite clear to him and he understood exactly what it was about. Following graduation, Bill went on to graduate studies in language (Chinese) and anthropology at Columbia University, but dropped out in 1972 to go to the Fo Guang Shanin Taiwan, a Buddhist monastery. After a year Bill left and spent the next two and half years at the College of Chinese Culture, a smaller, less crowded monastery outside of Taipei in the mountains where he became a graduate student in philosophy.[3] In the years following, he lived in Taiwan and Hong Kong. After 1989 he traveled extensively in China, both as a journalist and on his own. He adopted a Chinese art name, \"Red Pine\" (赤松 \"Chi Song\"), after the legendary Taoist immortal.[4] In 1993, after 22 years in East Asia, he returned to the US.[5] In 1999 and 2000, he taught Buddhism and Taoism at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas.[5] He now lives in Port Townsend, Washington.[6] His book Road to Heaven prompted Edward A. Burger to seek out and study with Buddhist hermits in the Zhongnan mountains of China and direct the 2005 film Amongst White Clouds.[7] In 2009, Copper Canyon Press published his translation of Laozi's Tao Te Ching. One of the most noteworthy aspects of this translation is Porter's use of excerpts from China's vast and rich commentarial tradition. In 2012, he published a translation of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra (Lankavatara Sutra: Translation and Commentary. Counterpoint, 2012.) It is based on several early Chinese and Sanskrit translations including the Chinese translation made by Guṇabhadra in 443. 2014 brought a re-translation of The Mountain Poems of Stonehouse. Stonehouse was a fourteenth century Zen master who wrote his poems late in life while living alone in a Chinese mountain hut. Yellow River Odyssey is an account in photographs and text of Porter's early 1990s travels along the Yellow River from its mouth at the Yellow Sea to its source in the Tibetan Plateau. Along the way, Porter visited historical religious sites related to Confucius, Mencius, Laozi and Zhuang Zhou. The Chinese version was based on 1991 radio scripts for Hong Kong radio station Metro News.[8] \"The Silk Road: Taking the bus to Pakistan\" details the author's overland journey with his friend Finn Wilcox from Xi'an to Islamabad by bus, train, and plane. It's a first-person account of scenery, artifacts, and people along the northern route of the Silk Road.","Title":"Red Pine (author) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18845","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pine_(author)"}
