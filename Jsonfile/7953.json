{"Content: ":"1863 (Chicago Medical College) 1870 (affiliation with Northwestern) 1906 (Northwestern University Medical School) Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine is the medical school of Northwestern University and is located in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1859, Feinberg offers a full-time Doctor of Medicine degree program, multiple joint degree programs, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education. Feinberg ranked 17th among American medical schools for research by U.S. News & World Report in 2022.[5] It also is committed to patient care and community service.[6] Through clinical affiliates Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago), Feinberg faculty provide patient care to tens of thousands of individuals every year. Feinberg and its clinical affiliates are together a $5 billion academic medical enterprise.[7][8] The school employs 4,000 faculty members.[9] Hosmer Johnson, Nathan Smith Davis, Ralph Isham, Edmund Andrews, David Rutter and William Byford co-founded[10] the medical department of Lind University on October 11, 1859.[11] It was renamed the Chicago Medical College in 1863, and affiliated with Northwestern University in 1870. The Woman\u2019s Medical College of Chicago, established in 1870 as the Woman\u2019s Hospital Medical College, became affiliated with Northwestern in 1892 as Northwestern University Woman\u2019s Medical School.[12] The college closed in 1902[13] as other schools in Chicago and the nation began accepting women. In 1906, the Chicago Medical College was renamed Northwestern University Medical School.[14] It had occupied buildings on the near south side of Chicago from 1863[15] until the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building was constructed in Streeterville in 1926.[16] Northwestern University Medical School was renamed the Feinberg School of Medicine in 2002, reflecting a $75 million donation from the Joseph and Bessie Feinberg Foundation. Reuben Feinberg started to donate to the university after being hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a heart attack. The first donation, in 1988, was for $17 million to establish the Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute. A $10 million donation was subsequently sent in 1996 to establish the Frances Evelyn Feinberg Clinical Neurosciences Institute. On September 1, 2013, Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation, the medical school's physician's group, joined Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC), the health system that includes Northwestern Memorial Hospital, forming a new physician's group called Northwestern Medical Group. Together, NMHC and Feinberg jointly share the brand \"Northwestern Medicine.\"[17][18] On May 8, 2015, exactly 90 years after Northwestern University first broke ground on its Chicago campus, Feinberg broke ground on the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center. The building opened in June 2019 and added more than 625,000 square feet and 12 stories of research space to the downtown campus.[19] The Feinberg School of Medicine is part of the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University. Other McGaw members include: Feinberg medical students and McGaw residents receive their clinical training at these hospitals, where nearly all the attending staff members have faculty appointments at the Feinberg School of Medicine. Residents also train at affiliates such as John H. Stroger Jr Hospital of Cook County, Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital, Swedish Covenant Hospital, MacNeal Hospital, and Methodist Hospital in Gary, Indiana. The medical school's primary teaching hospital is Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a 2,200,000-square-foot (200,000 m2) modern hospital that was completed in 1999. In the 2020 US News and World Report list of \"Honor Roll\" Hospitals, listing the top 10 medical centers in the United States, Northwestern Memorial Hospital is ranked 10th, and first in Illinois,[20] and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab was ranked first in the country for rehabilitation.[21] The Feinberg School of Medicine is home to 657 medical students. The class of students who graduated in 2020 are the 161st graduating class. For the 2020 entering class, 7,052 people applied for 160 seats. The median undergraduate GPA and MCAT score for successful applicants are 3.9 and 519, respectively.[22] In 2012, Feinberg's entering medical students began a new curriculum, organized into three phases and emphasizing integration of four main curricular elements: science in medicine, clinical medicine, health & society, and professional development. The goal of the renewal process is to build a more learner-centered educational program that (1) fully integrates scientific principles in a clinical context; (2) stimulates inquiry and investigation; (3) has an assessment system that comprehensively evaluates student achievement in each of the core competencies; (4) reinforces a culture of learning, teamwork, and excellence; (5) is flexible and able to meet the unique needs of individual students as they learn and differentiate.[23] For medical students, the school offers four-year dual degree programs, which combine the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree with a Master of Public Health (MPH), a Master of Arts in Medical Humanities and Bioethics (MA), a Master of Science in Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety (MS), or a Master of Business Administration (MBA). Students electing to pursue the additional degrees enroll in evening classes and graduate with both degrees. Two MD/PhD programs are offered, one in combination with Northwestern University's Graduate School (Medical Scientist Training Program) and one with the University's Institute for Neuroscience. The school also offers graduate degree programs, some in combination with other Northwestern University professional schools: Additionally, the school offers a BS/MD degree through the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME), a seven-year combined undergraduate and medical school program. According to public financial data for Feinberg, support for competitive research grants from all external sources totaled $643 million in academic year 2019-2020.[24] In 2018, Feinberg ranked 15th for NIH funding among American medical schools.[25] The medical school houses more than 30 Core Facilities, including a Bioinformatics Consulting Core, Genomics Core and Human Embryonic and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core.[26] Faculty in the Research program at Feinberg study and mentor in a range of areas, including cancer biology, cell biology, chemical biology, drug discovery, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, genetics, genomics, medical biology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, neurobiology, pharmacology, structural biology, biochemistry, epigenetics, epidemiology, behavioral sciences, preventive medicine, epidemiology, health outcomes, quality improvement, and translational sciences. Recent Growth In June 2019, the University opened a $560 million, 625,000 square-foot biomedical research building on the Chicago campus. The new building, the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center, is connected to the existing Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center. A second phase of build out will eventually total 1.2 million square feet in the new building when complete.[27] Additionally, more than 250,000 square feet of space in existing campus buildings has been converted to new laboratory space.[28] Nobel Laureates In 2021, Feinberg was ranked 15th among American medical research schools by U.S. News & World Report.[30] The school is ranked 15th in the National Institutes of Health funding rankings among all American Medical Schools.[31] The school's major affiliated teaching hospitals rank in U.S. News and World Report's Best Hospitals 2020-2021 as follows:[32]","Title":"Feinberg School of Medicine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7953","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feinberg_School_of_Medicine"}
