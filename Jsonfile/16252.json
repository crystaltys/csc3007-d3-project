{"Content: ":"The battle of Popasna was a military engagement between joint Russian-LPR forces and Ukrainian forces in the city of Popasna in the Luhansk Oblast. The battle began on 18 March and ended on 7 May 2022 and was part of the 2022 Battle of Donbas during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. A city of over 22,000 people, Popasna was an important regional hub with numerous roadway junctions key to the Russian advance during the eastern Ukraine offensive.[5] Russian-Ukrainian clashes for the heavily fortified city began on 18 March 2022. Regionally, troops of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) and the Russian Armed Forces advanced and captured Kreminna farther to the north on 18 April. They later began advancing towards Popasna on the southern axis and Rubizhne along the southern axis. In mid-April, Russian and LPR troops launched artillery and air strikes on Ukrainian positions in the Popasna area. As clashes and shelling continued, civilians living in frontline areas fled to basements for shelter. However, by 18 April, according to the Institute for the Study of War, the Russian military was not making much progress on the ground. According to pro-Russian sources, Russian-LPR forces launched more artillery and missile barrages in the region on 20 April following nighttime Ukrainian counterattacks. The same day, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed that Gennady Shcherbak, a \"Ukrainian nationalist that collaborated with NATO instructors\" was killed in Popasna.[6][7] On 21 April, Ukraine's 24th Mechanized Brigade, one of the main units defending the sector, claimed to have killed what appeared to be 25-man unit of pro-Russian foreign mercenaries in overnight clashes in and around Popasna. Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine's National Security Council, said Libyan and Syrian identification documents were purportedly recovered from the bodies of the unit. The 24th Mechanized Brigade said it had successfully repelled their assault and suggested the militants were foreign fighters of private military company Wagner Group and Russian citizens of rural origins. Danilov said Popasna remained under full Ukrainian control, however the chairman of the Luhansk Regional Administration, Serhiy Haidai, said heavy fighting continued for the city.[8] On 22 April, Serhiy Haidai declared that the Russian army had failed in Popasna and Rushzhne. At the same time, Haidai said that Russian and LPR troops controlled 80 percent of the territory of Luhansk.[9] However, two weeks later on 7 May, the city was reportedly captured by Russian mercenary forces from Wagner Group. The city had been ravaged by the fighting and Chechen Kadyrovites were suspected of having participated in the last phase of the battle. Haidai confirmed that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn.[10][2] On 8 May, Haidai initially said in his Telegram channel that the Russians controlled only half of the city,[10] but later admitted Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from Popasna.[11] Western assessments considered Popasna to be fully under Russian control. According to the publication RIA FAN, Russian and LPR forces set up a temporary Russian civil\u2013military administration of the city and continued to advance beyond the city as part of the larger offensive.[12]","Title":"Battle of Popasna - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16252","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Popasna"}
