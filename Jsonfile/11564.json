{"Content: ":"Bobasatraniiformes is an extinct order of durophagous ray-finned fish that existed from the late Permian to the Middle Triassic in both marine and freshwater environments. The order includes two families: Bobasatraniidae, with the genera Bobasatrania, Ebenaqua, and Ecrinesomus, and Dorypteridae, comprising only the genus Dorypterus (monotypy). Bobasatraniiformes had a somewhat global distribution; fossils are found in Africa (Madagascar), Asia (Pakistan), Australia, Europe, and North America.[1] Most bobasatraniiforms were small [25 centimetres (9.8 in) or less], but some species of Bobasatrania grew up to 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) long. Bobasatraniiformes have a deepend body, a heterocercal caudal fin, and they often lack pelvic fins (present in Dorypterus, very small in Ebenaqua). Their dorsal and anal fins are often elongate (very elongate dorsal fin in Dorypterus). The body is covered in rhombic scales (scale cover reduced in Dorypterus). Their jaw bones lack teeth. Instead, they possessed strong tooth plates used to crush shelled prey animals similar to Modern osteoglossomorphs (Teleostei). The evolutionary relationships of Bobasatraniiformes with other actinopterygians is not well known, but they are usually placed outside of Neopterygii.[2] Bobasatraniiformes are one of the groups that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event.[3]  This article about a prehistoric ray-finned fish is a stub.
