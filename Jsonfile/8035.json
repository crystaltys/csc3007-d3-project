{"Content: ":"Genentech, Inc., is an American biotechnology corporation which became a subsidiary of Roche in 2009. Genentech Research and Early Development operates as an independent center within Roche.[5] Historically, the company is regarded as the world's first biotechnology company.[6] As of July 2021, Genentech employed 13,539 people.[7] The company was founded in 1976 by venture capitalist Robert A. Swanson and biochemist Herbert Boyer.[8][9] Boyer is considered to be a pioneer in the field of recombinant DNA technology. In 1973, Boyer and his colleague Stanley Norman Cohen demonstrated that restriction enzymes could be used as \"scissors\" to cut DNA fragments of interest from one source, to be ligated into a similarly cut plasmid vector.[10] While Cohen returned to the laboratory in academia, Swanson contacted Boyer to found the company.[8][11] Boyer worked with Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura from the Beckman Research Institute, and the group became the first to successfully express a human gene in bacteria when they produced the hormone somatostatin in 1977.[12] David Goeddel and Dennis Kleid were then added to the group, and contributed to its success with synthetic human insulin in 1978. In 1990 F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG acquired a majority stake in Genentech.[13] In 2006 Genentech acquired Tanox in its first acquisition deal. Tanox had started developing Xolair and development was completed in collaboration with Novartis and Genentech; the acquisition allowed Genentech to keep more of the revenue.[14] In March 2009 Roche acquired Genentech by buying shares it didn't already control for approximately $46.8 billion.[15][16][17] In July 2014, Genentech/Roche acquired Seragon for its pipeline of small-molecule cancer drug candidates for $725 million cash upfront, with an additional $1 billion of payments dependent on successful development of products in Seragon's pipeline.[18] Genentech is a pioneering research-driven biotechnology company[13] that has continued to conduct R&D internally as well as through collaborations.[19][20] Genentech's research collaborations include: Genentech's corporate headquarters are in South San Francisco, California ( 37°39\u203225\u2033N 122°22\u203244\u2033W﻿ / ﻿37.657°N 122.379°W﻿ / 37.657; -122.379﻿ (Genentech)), with additional manufacturing facilities in Vacaville, California; Oceanside, California; and Hillsboro, Oregon. In December 2006, Genentech sold its Porriño, Spain, facility to Lonza and acquired an exclusive right to purchase Lonza's mammalian cell culture manufacturing facility under construction in Singapore. In June 2007, Genentech began the construction and development of an E. coli manufacturing facility, also in Singapore, for the worldwide production of Lucentis (ranibizumab injection) bulk drug substance.[citation needed] Genentech is a donor to the Center for Health Care Strategies, a non-governmental organization that lobbies the United States Government on issues related to Medicaid.[30] Genentech Inc Political Action Committee is a U.S. Federal Political Action Committee (PAC), created to \"aggregate contributions from members or employees and their families to donate to candidates for federal office\".[31] In November 1999, Genentech agreed to pay the University of California, San Francisco $200 million to settle a nine-year-old patent dispute. In 1990, UCSF sued Genentech for $400 million in compensation for alleged theft of technology developed at the university and covered by a 1982 patent.[citation needed] Genentech claimed that they developed Protropin (recombinant somatotropin/human growth hormone), independently of UCSF. A jury ruled that the university's patent was valid in July 1999, but wasn't able to decide whether Protropin was based upon UCSF research or not. Protropin, a drug used to treat dwarfism, was Genentech's first marketed drug and its $2 billion in sales has contributed greatly to its position as an industry leader.[citation needed] The settlement was to be divided as follows: $30 million to the University of California General Fund, $85 million to the three inventors and two collaborating scientists, $50 million towards a new teaching and research campus for UCSF, and $35 million to support university-wide research.[32] In 2009, The New York Times reported that Genentech's talking points on health care reform appeared verbatim in the official statements of several Members of Congress during the national health care reform debate.[33] Two U.S. Representatives, Joe Wilson and Blaine Luetkemeyer, both issued the same written statements: \"One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India.\" The statement was originally drafted by lobbyists for Genentech.","Title":"Genentech - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8035","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech"}
