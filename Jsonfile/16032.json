As of January 2008, Zvezda's CEO was Grigory Krichevsky, previously known for his work on Vladimir Gusinsky's NTV channel in the late 1990s. In 1998 Central Television and Radio Studio of the Russian Ministry of Defense wins the tender to broadcast the channel in the competition. On July 17, 2000, Zvezda channel was licensed for broadcasting. On February 20, 2005, Zvezda channel first began broadcasting on 57th UHF channel in Moscow.

In 2007 the audience of the channel grew further, as it was included in the package of NTV+. Since 2009 Zvezda is a federal status channel. In March 2015, Zvezda offered a presenting job to Jeremy Clarkson less than 24 hours after he was dismissed by the BBC from motoring programme Top Gear.[1] Zvezda describes itself as \"patriotic\" and is considered one of the most sensational and anti-Western news channels in Russia. It has a reputation for publishing biased news stories which favor the Russian government. It has published several controversial news articles in the past, for example:[2][3] In 2014\u201315, Zvezda employed Graham Phillips, a British vlogger who promoted the Russian narrative in the war in Donbas and was banned from Ukraine for his work.[6] StopFake reported that Phillips was awarded a medal by Russia's Border Guard, a branch of the FSB, a Russian intelligence agency.[7] They reported that Zvezda published an article in July 2015 on the MH17 airplane shot down above Ukraine in 2014 by pro-Russian fighters, which used Phillips' video and witness testimony to assert that the plane was in fact shot down by Ukrainian jets.[7]","Title":"Zvezda (TV channel) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16032","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezda_(TV_channel)"}
