{"Content: ":"Mathieu Debuchy (born 28 July 1985) is a French professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Ligue 2 club Valenciennes. Debuchy started his senior career at Lille, where he won a Ligue 1 and Coupe de France double in the 2010\u201311 season. He played in Ligue 1 for 10 seasons for Lille. He joined Newcastle United in January 2013 and stayed there for 18 months. Debuchy played for Arsenal from July 2014 to January 2018, including a loan spell to Bordeaux in 2016. From January 2018 to August 2021, he played for Saint-Étienne. Debuchy made his debut for the France national team in October 2011. He earned 27 caps, playing in the final tournaments of UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Debuchy was born in Fretin, Nord.[5] He began his career playing for his hometown club Union Sportive Fretin before joining Lille at the age of eight. After spending a decade in Lille's youth system, he was promoted to the senior team following the winter break of the 2003\u201304 season. Debuchy was given the number 33 shirt and simultaneously made his professional debut and first start on 31 January 2004 in a league match against Metz.[6] He played the entire match as Lille recorded a 1\u20130 win. Debuchy made five more appearances that season, which included two starts and three substitute appearances.[citation needed] The following season, Debuchy switched to the number 2 and his playing time increased significantly. He appeared in 19 matches and scored three goals. His first professional goal came against Bordeaux. Debuchy scored the goal in the first minute of the match. Lille's solid form that season resulted in the club finishing second in the league and, as a result, qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. Debuchy was also instrumental in Lille's run to the Round of 16 in 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup where the club was eliminated by rival French club Auxerre.[7] Debuchy became a fixture in the starting eleven during the 2005\u201306 season. On 26 March 2006, he damaged knee ligaments in a league match against Strasbourg. The injury required surgery ruling him out for six months.[8] As a result of the injury, Debuchy missed the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. A week after suffering the injury, on 4 April, Lille officials awarded Debuchy a contract extension until 2010.[9] Debuchy signed a contract extension on 28 February 2011, tying him down to the club until 2015.[10] That season he was instrumental in the team's advancement to the final of the Coupe de France appearing in all five matches the team contested. In the final, Debuchy played the entire match as Lille defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1\u20130 at the Stade de France. Lille were awarded a late penalty shortly after going 1-0 up; Debuchy took the penalty but it was saved by Grégory Coupet, however Lille still held on to win 1-0.[11][12][13] A week later, Lille clinched the Ligue 1 championship by drawing 2\u20132 away to Paris Saint-Germain, Debuchy providing the cross from which Moussa Sow netted Lille's second goal.[14] The result meant that the players had achieved the club's first league championship since the 1953\u201354 season and the club's first double since the 1945\u201346 season.[15][16] The domestic cup and league title were the first two domestic honours of Debuchy's career.[citation needed] The following season started off with a 1\u20131 draw against Nancy on 6 August 2011, with Debuchy opening the scoring in the 47th minute.[17] Debuchy was part of the Lille squad that dramatically fell 5\u20134 to Bordeaux on 12 February 2012, scoring Lille's third goal of the game as former teammate, Ludovic Obraniak netted the winner in the 90th minute.[18] The following weekend, Lille got back on track with a 1\u20130 defeat of Lorient, as Debuchy scored the only goal of the game.[19] Debuchy started and played the full 90 minutes in all six group games of the Champions League that season, as Lille finished bottom of their tight group and crashed out of Europe because of a 0\u20130 draw with Trabzonspor on the final matchday.[20][21] The campaign was hugely successful for Debuchy on a personal level as he made his breakthrough in the French squad as well as being named in the UNFP Team of the Year.[22] Following the season, Lille manager Rudi Garcia described Debuchy as a defender who \"plays high and attacks but defensively is also very rigorous and he exudes confidence.\"[23] Garcia also revealed that the club had rejected a £4 million bid from Newcastle United.[23] Seven months after their failed bid, English club Newcastle United signed Debuchy on a five-and-a-half-year contract on 4 January 2013, for an undisclosed fee reportedly in the region of £5.5 million.[24][25] He made his debut for Newcastle on 12 January 2013 against Norwich City.[26][27] He scored his first and only Newcastle United competitive goal of his career in the Premier League Tyne\u2013Wear derby against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on 27 October 2013, levelling the score after half time before Newcastle ultimately lost the match 2\u20131.[28] On 1 January 2014, Debuchy was sent off for the first time in his Newcastle career after a rash challenge on Claudio Yacob in an eventual 1\u20130 defeat away to West Bromwich Albion.[29] Debuchy moved to fellow Premier League club Arsenal on 17 July 2014, signing a long-term deal for an undisclosed fee (believed to be around £12 million[30]) and was given the number 2 shirt from fellow Frenchman Abou Diaby, who took the vacant number 24.[31] He said \"Playing again in the Champions League is a big excitement for me and I will do my best to help Arsenal compete for trophies\".[32] He made his competitive debut for Arsenal in their 3\u20130 victory over defending league champions Manchester City in the 2014 FA Community Shield at Wembley Stadium on 10 August 2014.[33] Six days later he featured in the Premier League for the first time as an Arsenal player, his injury-time shot was saved and then converted by Aaron Ramsey for a 2\u20131 win at home against Crystal Palace.[34] Debuchy was sent off for two bookings on 27 August in Arsenal's win over Beşiktaş in the Champions League play-offs.[35] On 13 September 2014, Debuchy damaged his ankle ligaments near the end of a 2\u20132 draw against Manchester City. He was administered oxygen and taken off the pitch on a stretcher.[36] Following surgery on his ankle, he was ruled out for about three months.[37][38] He returned to the first team against Galatasaray in a Champions League match on 9 December. Twelve days after that, he scored his first goal for the club, the first equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw against Liverpool at Anfield.[39] Debuchy went off injured against Stoke City on 11 January 2015. He was then given an operation on his dislocated shoulder, and ruled out for a further three months.[40] Debuchy made his return from injury on 18 April 2015, playing the full 120 minutes as Arsenal defeated Reading 2\u20131 in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley.[41] He made no further appearances that season, with Héctor Bellerín instead playing at right-back in Arsenal's 4\u20130 win over Aston Villa in the Cup Final; Debuchy did not make the substitutes bench for that match.[42] Arsenal retained the Community Shield on 2 August, with Bellerín again starting ahead of Debuchy.[43] Debuchy played only two 2015\u201316 Premier League matches, starting in Arsenal's first Premier League match of the 2015\u201316 season against West Ham United on 9 August and also starting in the Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur on 8 November.[44] On 22 July 2016, after finishing his half-season loan spell at Ligue 1 club Bordeaux, Debuchy returned to Arsenal during the pre-season, playing the first half of Arsenal's 1\u20131 friendly away draw against French Ligue 2 side Lens. On 27 November 2016, he made his first Premier League start against AFC Bournemouth at the Emirates Stadium, but went off with a hamstring injury after just 16 minutes as the Gunners won 3\u20131, ruling him out until January 2017.
