{"Content: ":"There are many outdoor sculptures in Washington, D.C. In addition to the capital's most famous monuments and memorials, many figures recognized as national heroes (either in government or military) have been posthumously awarded with his or her own statue in a park or public square. Some figures appear on several statues: Abraham Lincoln, for example, has at least three likenesses, including those at the Lincoln Memorial, in Lincoln Park, and the old Superior Court of the District of Columbia. A number of international figures, such as Mohandas Gandhi, have also been immortalized with statues. The Statue of Freedom is a 19Â½-foot (5.9 m) tall allegorical statue that rests atop the United States Capitol dome. In addition to the human likenesses, a number of public and private sculptures of animals, objects, and abstractions are spread throughout the city. Two museums on the National Mall include sculpture gardens: the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the National Gallery of Art.","Title":"Outdoor sculpture in Washington, D.C. - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3888","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoor_sculpture_in_Washington,_D.C."}
