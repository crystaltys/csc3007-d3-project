{"Content: ":"Coilia ramcarati (below) Coilia, the grenadier anchovies, is a genus of anchovies. It currently contains 12\u201313 species.[1][2] They are found in East, Southeast and South Asia, and mostly inhabit estuarine regions, but there are also species in coastal marine habitats and rivers (at least up to 1,000 km or 620 mi from the sea in C. brachygnathus).[2] The largest is up to 41 cm (16 in) in length, but most species only reach around half that size.[2] It derives its generic name coilia from the Greek koilia, meaning \"hollow\" or \"abdomen\".[3] There are 12[1] or 13 species:[2] The Catalog of Fishes considers Coilia brachygnathus synonym of Coilia nasus,[1] hence listing one species less that the FishBase.[2]  This Clupeiformes article is a stub.
