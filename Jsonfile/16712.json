{"Content: ":"Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami ISIL (2015-present) Bangladesh has experienced terrorism in the past conducted by a number of different organizations.[4][5] In the past, both ISIL and other terrorist organizations had claimed to be active in the country however, the Bangladeshi government believes that they mainly operated through local affiliates, before being neutralised by security forces. The first Bangladeshi Islamist factions emerged in 1989, when a network of 30 different factions was established and expanded in the following years. The main goal of most Islamist groups in Bangladesh is to create a separate Islamic state, or to govern Bangladesh according to Sharia law. Islamist groups have conducted operations against the ruling party's corruptions in the country. Islamic groups are alleged to be terrorists for political interests.
