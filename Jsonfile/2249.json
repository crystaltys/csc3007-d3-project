{"Content: ":"Parade is an American nationwide Sunday newspaper magazine, distributed in more than 700 newspapers in the United States.[1] It was founded in 1941. The most widely read magazine in the U.S., Parade has a circulation of 32 million and a readership of 54.1 million.[2] [update] As of 2015, its editor was Anne Krueger.[3] The magazine was founded by Marshall Field III in 1941 (the first issue was published on May 31),[4] and is currently part of AMG/Parade, which purchased it from Advance Publications as a weekly magazine supplement for his own paper (the Chicago Sun) and for others in the United States. By 1946, Parade had achieved a circulation of 3.5 million. John Hay Whitney, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune, bought Parade in 1958. Booth Newspapers purchased it in 1973. Booth was purchased by Advance Publications in 1976, and Parade became a separate operating unit within Advance.[5] Parade Digital Partners is a distribution network that includes the web site Parade.com and over 700 of the magazine's partner newspaper web sites. Parade Digital Partners has a reach of more than 30 million monthly unique visitors (comScore Q1 2014). Throughout 2016, Gannett Company, which had produced USA Weekend, the most direct competitor to Parade until its December 2014 discontinuation, added (or in most cases, re-added to acquired newspapers) Parade to many of its Sunday newspapers as a replacement. Beginning on the weekend of December 28, 2019, Parade changed its publishing schedule to skip six weekends a year, planning to publish combined holiday issues. The first such combined publication was a Christmas-themed issue published the weekend of December 21, 2019.[6][7] The magazine published the weekend of April 4, 2020 also covered the weekend of April 11; Easter was April 12.[8] No magazine was published on the weekend of May 2, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[9] The magazine published the weekend of May 16 also covered the weekend of May 23; Memorial Day was May 25.[10] The magazine published the weekend of June 27 also covered the weekend of July 4, Independence Day.[11] The magazine published the weekend of August 29 also covered the weekend of September 5; Labor Day was September 7.[12] The magazine published the weekend of December 19 also covered the weekend of December 26. In 2021, the magazine was not scheduled to be published the weekends of April 3, May 29, July 3, July 31, September 4 or December 25.[13] The dates for 2022 are May 29, July 3, August 27 and December 25.[14] The magazine has one main feature article, often a smaller feature article, and a number of regular columns. There is also advertising for consumer products, some with clippable coupons or tear-off business reply cards. The magazine has a lag time to publication of about ten days, which has caused the magazine to print statements that were out-of-date by the time Parade was publicly available in a weekend newspaper. The January 6, 2008 edition cover and main article asked whether Benazir Bhutto was \"America's best hope against Al-Qaeda,\" after her December 27, 2007 assassination.[21] In response to reader and media[22][23] complaints (and besides individual newspapers noting the discrepancy to prevent reader confusion, as the magazine had an additional week of lag time due to the holiday season), Parade stated on their website: \"Dear Parade Readers, Parade publishes more than 32 million copies of each issue and distributes them to 415 newspapers across the country. In order to meet our printing, distribution and insertion deadlines, we must send the issue to the printer three weeks before the cover date. Our Benazir Bhutto issue, for example, went to press on Dec. 19. By the time Ms. Bhutto was slain on Dec. 27, this issue of Parade was already printed and shipped to our partner newspapers. Recalling, reprinting and redistributing our January 6 issue was not an option.\"[24] A similar incident occurred in the February 11, 2007 issue when Walter Scott's \"Personality Parade\" reported that Barbaro, an American thoroughbred racehorse and winner of the 2006 Kentucky Derby, was in a stable condition. Barbaro was euthanized thirteen days earlier, on January 29, 2007.[25] On April 27, 2014, Walter Scott's \"Personality Parade\" reported that Joby Ogwyn would BASE jump in a wingsuit from the summit of Mount Everest live on the Discovery Channel in May 2014. However, before the edition appeared in print, the government of Nepal closed Mount Everest to climbers because of an avalanche on April 18, 2014 that killed 16 Sherpas, including five Sherpas working for the Discovery Channel in advance of Ogwyn's planned jump, hastening the cancellation of the special. The January 16, 2022 edition of the magazine featured a cover story about actress Betty White, whose 100th birthday would have been the next day on January 17. She unexpectedly died at the end of 2021 on December 31 (a New Year's Eve Friday), leaving not only the regular lag time, but holiday season lag time preserving what was then an erroneous feature and requiring newspaper disclosures of the issue.[26]","Title":"Parade (magazine) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2249","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)"}
