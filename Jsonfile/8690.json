{"Content: ":"The Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race also known as Great Ocean Road Race or Cadel Road Race is an annual professional one-day road bicycle racing for both men and women starting and finishing in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, and routed along the picturesque Great Ocean Road. The first race was held in 2015, as the farewell race for Cadel Evans\u2014Australia's only Tour de France winner or Road World Champion.[1] The 2017 edition was added to the UCI World Tour for the first time.[2][3] In November 2020, it was announced that the 2021 race would not be held due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. This was due in part to a number of UCI WorldTour teams making the decision to stay in Europe due to uncertainty around international travel conditions and logistics of quarantine requirements.[4] The men's version is 171 km (106 mi), while the women's is 122 km (76 mi). As of 2019, the mass People's Ride includes three distance options\u201435km, 65km, or 115km.[5][6] The race starts in the city of Geelong in Victoria, going through Evans' hometown of Barwon Heads on the Bellarine Peninsula, passing by the famous surf beach of Bells Beach in Surf Coast Shire and continuing along the Great Ocean Road. The race then heads via rolling hills back to Geelong for three circuits of the city before a waterfront finish. The course is suited to puncheurs.[1] In 2017 the pre-race criterium was known as the Race Melbourne - Albert Park, becoming the Towards Zero Race Melbourne in 2018.[7] In 2019 the race was held in a team-based format with points awarded for sprints. Deceuninck-QuickStep won the men's event[8] and Trek Segafredo won the women's event.[9] In 2020 the race was not held and was replaced by Race Torquay.[10]","Title":"Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8690","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadel_Evans_Great_Ocean_Road_Race"}
