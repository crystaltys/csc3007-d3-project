{"Content: ":"See text Euselachii are an infraclass of a class of cartilaginous fish. This group includes sharks and rays.[2][3][4] Of the 14 orders that compose Euselachii, 8 belong to the sharks, 6 to the rays, without an intermediate taxon separating sharks of rays. For this reason, some authors have separated Euselachii in two: super-order Selachimorpha corresponding to orders of sharks; super-order Rajomorphii corresponding to the orders of rays, torpedoes, sawfish and guitar fish. For those who do not recognize these two super-orders, Euselachii therefore has for synonyms Pleurotremata, Selachimorpha and Rajomorphii. Both oviparity and viviparity are found in Euselachii. Around 70% of sharks are viviparous,[5] including some members of Carcharhiniformes such as requiem sharks and hammerhead sharks, while the remaining 30% of sharks as well as all rays are either oviparous or ovoviviparous. There was a recent discovery that a Palaeozoic chondrichthyan (carcharopsis) was found to no longer resemble the \"triple-layer\" tooth structure that the modern day chondrichthyan sharks model.","Title":"Euselachii - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1484","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euselachii"}
