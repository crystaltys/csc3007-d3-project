{"Content: ":"The American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) is a private conservatory for the performing arts located in New York City[1] and Los Angeles, California. The conservatory offers both Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees and two-year certificates in professional performance. Programs are offered in acting, musical theatre, dance, and performing arts. It is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre.[2] AMDA was founded in 1964 by Philip Burton and the New York theatre community.[3] By 1970, the school had outgrown its original location on East 23rd Street and moved into a new building on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. A few years later, further growth prompted a move to the Ansonia Building.[4] In the 1990s a second location, which is now the principal location of AMDA New York, was opened near Lincoln Center.[3] In 2003 the school expanded west by opening AMDA Los Angeles in the Vine Tower Building.[5] AMDA is a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) granting performing arts college with campuses in both New York and Los Angeles.[5] The New York City campus is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The principal facility is located at 211 West 61st Street,[1] directly behind Lincoln Center. The other half of the campus is located at the Ansonia building, on West 73rd Street.[3] The Los Angeles campus is located in the Hollywood Entertainment District, with its principal facility in the Vine Tower Building.[5] AMDA's Los Angeles campus features four main theatres for learning, skill development and performance including a black box theatre, two laboratory theatres, and an outdoor amphitheater. Other facilities include rehearsal space, film, TV and editing facilities, library, the AMDA Caf√©, and the campus piazza.[3]","Title":"American Musical and Dramatic Academy - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18550","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Musical_and_Dramatic_Academy"}
