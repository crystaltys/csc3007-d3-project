{"Content: ":"The 1944 Republican National Convention was held in Chicago, Illinois, from June 26 to 28, 1944. It nominated Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York for president and Governor John Bricker of Ohio for vice president. When the convention opened, Governor Dewey was the front-runner for the nomination. 1940 presidential nominee, Wendell Willkie again vied for the nomination, but when he lost the Wisconsin primary, the lack of support from the Republican Party became evident. (Before the election, Willkie would die of a heart attack.) Dewey was nominated on the first ballot. He became the second Republican candidate to accept his party's nomination in-person at the convention. All subsequent Republican nominees have accepted their nominations in person with the exception of Donald Trump who in 2020 delivered his re-nomination acceptance speech from The White House because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][2] During the convention, Chicago's Billy Goat Tavern gained notoriety for posting a notice saying \"No Republicans Allowed\". This caused Republican conventioneers to pack the place, demanding to be served, and led to increased publicity for the tavern.[3] The 1944 Republican platform included a call for a Constitutional amendment establishing equal rights for women. This line was included in all subsequent platforms until 1980,[4] when the debate over the Equal Rights Amendment was occurring.  This article related to the politics of the United States is a stub.
