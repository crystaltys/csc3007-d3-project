{"Content: ":"Karyorrhexis (from Greek κάρυον karyon, \"kernel, seed or nucleus\", and ῥῆξις rhexis, \"bursting\") is the destructive fragmentation of the nucleus of a dying cell[1] whereby its chromatin is distributed irregularly throughout the cytoplasm.[2] It is usually preceded by pyknosis and can occur as a result of either programmed cell death (apoptosis), cellular senescence, or necrosis. In apoptosis, the cleavage of DNA is done by Ca2+ and Mg2+ -dependent endonucleases. Morphological characteristics of pyknosis and other forms of nuclear destruction.
