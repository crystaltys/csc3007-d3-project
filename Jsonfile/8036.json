{"Content: ":"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (also known as Teva Pharmaceuticals) is an Israeli multinational pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Petah Tikva, Israel. It specializes primarily in generic drugs, but other business interests include active pharmaceutical ingredients and, to a lesser extent, proprietary pharmaceuticals. Until 2020, Teva Pharmaceuticals was the largest generic drug manufacturer, when it was surpassed by US-based Pfizer.[3] Overall, Teva is the 18th largest pharmaceutical company in the world.[4] Teva's facilities are located in Israel, North America, Europe, Australia, and South America. Teva shares are listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The company is a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[5][6] Teva's earliest predecessor was SLE, Ltd., a wholesale drug business founded in 1901 in Jerusalem, which at that time was part of the Ottoman Empire's Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. SLE Ltd. took its name from the initials of its three cofounders: Chaim Salomon, Moshe Levin and Yitschak Elstein, and used camels to make deliveries.[7] During the 1930s, new immigrants from Europe founded several pharmaceutical companies including Teva (\"nature\" in Hebrew) and Zori. In the 1930s, Salomon, Levin, and Elstein Ltd. also founded Assia, a pharmaceutical company. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries took its present form through the efforts of Günther Friedländer and his aunt Else Kober on May 1, 1935. The original registration was under the name Teva Middle East Pharmaceutical & Chemical Works Co. Ltd. in Jerusalem, then part of Mandatory Palestine. Friedländer was a German pharmacist, botanist and pharmacognosist, who immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1934, following the Nazi Party Rise to power. The company was built with an investment of 4,900 pounds sterling, which came from the family's own capital and partly from loans from other German immigrants. Capital shortage led to the joining of the banker Alfred Feuchtwanger as a partner in Teva, who received 33% of the shares in return for his investment.[8] In 1951, Feuchtwanger initiated an initial public offering to raise capital through the newly founded Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, and Teva became a public company.[7] Friedländer's business philosophy opined that the pharmaceutical industry has a reliable basis in difficult economic times, since \"A Jewish mother will always buy medicine for her children\". In the Second World War, the company provided medicine to the allied forces and in particular to the British army present in the Middle East. After the war, Sir Alan Gordon Cunningham, the last of the High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan, visited Teva on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. His visit promoted Teva's reputation in the pharmaceutical market and created a momentum for Teva's development. During the Second World War and until the termination of the British Mandatory Palestine regime, Teva exported its medical products to Arab countries. In 1941, Friedländer presented Teva products in an exhibition held in Cairo, Egypt. The exhibition was sponsored by the General Agent and Sole Distribution of medicine in Egypt and Sudan, Syria and Lebanon. Later on, Teva exported its products to the US, Soviet Union (USSR), health institutes in Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Persia and Burma. In 1954, Teva received a Certificate Excellence in Training award from the Israeli President, Yitzhak Ben Zvi.[citation needed] In 1964, Teva partnered with Sintex, a company from Mexico, and Schering Plough.[citation needed] In 1964, Assia and Zori merged and in 1968 acquired a controlling stake in Teva.[9] In 1976, the three companies merged into the modern-day Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.[9] In 1980, Teva acquired Ikapharm, then Israel's second largest drug manufacturer.[10] In 1980, Teva acquired Plantex.[11] In 1982, Teva was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Kfar Saba manufacturing plant.[12] In 1995, Teva acquired Biogal Gyógyszergyár Rt.

The plant received FDA approval in early 2007.[17] Teva entered the Japanese market in 2005, and in 2008 established a generics joint venture with Kowa.[18][19] In January 2006, Teva acquired its U.S. rival Ivax Corporation for $7.4 billion.[20][21] In 2008, sales totalled $11.08 billion, $13.9 billion in 2009, and in 2010 total sales rose to $16.1 billion, of which a major portion was in Europe and North America.
