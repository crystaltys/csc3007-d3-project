{"Content: ":"(For genera, see text) Aspidorhynchiformes (meaning \"shield snout form\") is an extinct order of ray-finned fish. It contains only a single family, the Aspidorhynchidae. Members of the group are noted for their elongated, conical rostrums, of varying length, formed from fused premaxillae. They are generally interpreted as stem-group teleosts. The range of the group extends from the Middle Jurassic to the late Paleocene. The order was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1859. Aspidorhynchiformes has one family, which is divided into at least two genera:[1][2][3] Fossils range have been found in the United States, France, Italy, Russia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Uzbekistan. These fossils range from 167.7mya (Aspidorhynchus) to 66 mya (Belonostomus longirostris). The most distinctive feature of the Aspidorhynchiformes are the elongated, tube-like rostrums, which are formed from fused premaxillary bones.[4] The scales are lepidosteoid, similar to those of gars.[5] Aspidorhynchiformes have generally been recovered as basal members of Teleosteomorpha, more closely related to teleosts than to Holostei. They have often considered to have a sister group relationship with Pachycormiformes, another group of basal teleosteomorphs.[6] The earliest known remains of the group are known from the Middle Jurassic of Europe, in what was then the western Tethys Ocean, which was likely the centre of their initial diversification, during the Late Jurassic they dispersed to the waters around the Caribbean, South America and Antarctica.[4] During the Cretaceous they dispersed worldwide.[7] The youngest members the group, belonging to Belonostomus went extinct during the late Paleocene.[8]    This article about a prehistoric ray-finned fish is a stub.
