Austin III.[698][699][700] They were joined by Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov.[700] The meeting discussed \"a steady flow of weapons and other military aid\" to Ukraine.[701] The coalition planned to continue meeting as a monthly \"contact group\" to address long-term support for Ukraine. In addition to European Union NATO countries, Ukraine, and the U.S., the coalition includes: Poland, Sweden, Finland, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Kenya, Liberia, Tunisia, Jordan, and Israel.[699] Their purpose is to work out ongoing aid to Ukraine, with an emphasis on providing \"lethal aid\" to help with the ongoing war. Austin said, \"I'd like this whole group to leave today with a common, transparent understanding of Ukraine's near-term security requirements\u2014because we're going to keep on moving heaven and earth to meet them.\"[700] According to Pentagon Press Secretary John F.
