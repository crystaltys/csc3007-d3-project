Hilton Foundation.[3][4] In 2017 and 2018, NEAR Network was critical of government donors failure to comply with 2016 commitments made as part of the Grand Bargain to fund local organizations directly.[5][6] In 2019, NEAR Network launched the Localisation Performance Measurement Framework to help harmonize systems of reporting to government donors.[1]","Title":"Network for Empowered Aid Response - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9083","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_for_Empowered_Aid_Response"}
