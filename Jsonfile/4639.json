{"Content: ":"On August 9, 1934, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented the seizure of all silver situated in the continental United States with Executive Order 6814 - Requiring the Delivery of All Silver to the United States for Coinage.[1][2][3] Executive Order 6814 closely mirrors Executive Order 6102, which FDR signed on April 5, 1933, \"forbidding the Hoarding of Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates within the continental United States\" with some differences. A key difference was that EO 6814 excluded the seizure of all silver coins, whether foreign or domestic, while EO 6102 only exempted from seizure certain types of collectible or numismatic coins.
