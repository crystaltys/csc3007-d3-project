{"Content: ":"The 1884 Democratic National Convention was held July 8\u201311, 1884 and chose Governor Grover Cleveland of New York their presidential nominee with the former Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana as the vice presidential nominee.[1] The leading candidate for the presidential nomination was New York Governor Grover Cleveland. Cleveland's reputation for good government made him a national figure. The Republican Party nominated James G. Blaine for president in June 1884, although he had been implicated in a financial scandal. Many influential Republicans were outraged, thought the time had come for a national reform administration and withdrew from the convention. These Republicans were called mugwumps, and declared that they would vote for the Democratic candidate based on his integrity. Governor Grover Cleveland of New York Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware Former Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana Former Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio Representative Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania Senator Joseph E. McDonald of Indiana House Speaker John G. Carlisle Governor George Hoadly of Ohio Seven names were placed in nomination: Grover Cleveland, Thomas F. Bayard, Allen G. Thurman, Samuel J. Randall, Joseph E. McDonald, John G. Carlisle, and George Hoadly. Thomas A. Hendricks professed that he was not a candidate for the presidential nomination. When a delegate from Illinois cast the only vote he received on the first ballot, Hendricks rose to ask this vote be withdrawn because it \"wrongly\" placed him before the convention. Nonetheless, Hendricks made an impressive showing on the second ballot but it was not enough to prevent the nomination of Cleveland.[citation needed] Source: US President - D Convention.
