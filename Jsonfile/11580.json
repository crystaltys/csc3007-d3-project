{"Content: ":"Acipenseridae Polyodontidae (see text for included genera) Acipenseroidei is a suborder of acipenseriform ray-finned fish. It contains the sturgeons (Acipenseridae) and paddlefishes (Polyodontidae), both living and fossil species.[1] Sturgeons are well known for the production of caviar. In 2020, an American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) was hybridised with a Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), producing what the Hungarian scientists responsible named a \"sturddlefish\".[2][3]   This Chondrostei-related article is a stub.
