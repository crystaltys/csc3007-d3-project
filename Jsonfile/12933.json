He became a management accountant and worked for Delmege Group before starting his own fright forwarding businesses.[1] Between 1988 and 1989, Karunanayake worked with Lalith Athulathmudali, a distant relative; in Athulathmudali's election campaign for his parliamentary seat in the Colombo District for the 1989 general elections. Athulathmudali left the United National Party and formed the Democratic United National Front, which was led by his wife Srimani Athulathmudali after his assassination in April 1993. Srimani along with the 'DUNF-Lalith Front' joined the People's Alliance under Chandrika Kumaratunga at the 1994 general elections.[1] In 1994, following the general elections, two national list seats were allocated to the DUNF. Karunanayake was appointed to parliament from one of these national list seats. In 1996, Srimani was removed from the Cabinet by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, and simultaneously Srimani and her party had a dispute over the affiliation to the Government. Karunanayake was more disposed toward the UNP, and as a result Srimani fired him from the DUNF-Lalith Front. However, through a court order, Karunanayake was able to become an Independent MP in 1998-1999. With the dissolution of Parliament in 1999, he joined the UNP, and became the organiser of Kotte.

He presented the controversial interim budget soon thereafter.[2] In 2017, The Banker magazine selected Karunanayake as the best finance minister in Asia pacific for securing a $1.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan programme to avoid a balance of payments crisis, replenish reserves and rebuild confidence among international investors. Government revenue grew from Rs. 1205 in 2014 to Rs. 1,461 billion in 2015. Tax revenue rose from Rs. 1,050 billion to Rs. 1,356 billion in the same period which is crucial for Sri Lanka as it has a very low tax revenue-to-gross domestic product ratio.
