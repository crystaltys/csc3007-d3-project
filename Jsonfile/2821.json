{"Content: ":"The Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.[1] According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guides the Best Pop Solo Performance Award as being designed for a solo performance pop recording (vocal and instrumental) and is limited to singles or tracks only.[2] The category was introduced in 2012 and combined the previous categories for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between male and female (and in some cases, solo instrumental) performances. The award goes to the performing artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.[3] Adele, with three victories, is the artist with the most awards in the category. As the inaugural recipient, she also won two times consecutively. Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande are the artists with the most nominations at four.
