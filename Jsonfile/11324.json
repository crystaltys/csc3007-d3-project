{"Content: ":"The NHS Nightingale Hospital Yorkshire and the Humber is one of the temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals set up by NHS England in 2020 to help to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital was constructed inside the Harrogate Convention Centre, Harrogate, and from 4 June 2020 was repurposed as a radiology diagnostic clinic. In March 2021, it was confirmed the hospital would close.[1] To add extra critical care capacity during the COVID-19 epidemic in England, and to treat those with COVID-19, plans were made to create further temporary hospital spaces for those in need of treatment and care.[2][3] They were named \"Nightingale Hospitals\", after Florence Nightingale who came to prominence for nursing soldiers during the Crimean War and is regarded as the founder of modern nursing.[4] The hospital was initially rumoured, then announced as officially planned on 3 April 2020,[5] and became ready to open on 14 April.[6] It was formally opened, via video link, by 99-year-old fundraiser Captain Tom Moore.[7] It is under Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.[8] It initially had beds for up to 500 people.[9] It was not a conventional walk-in hospital, and only patients who were already inpatients in other hospitals in the region and met certain criteria were to be admitted.[9] They would stay at the hospital until they were assessed as being ready to move back to a local hospital.[9] The hospital was not required to treat COVID-19 patients in April and May. Instead it was reopened as a radiology outpatient clinic, offering CT scanning, from 4 June 2020.[10] Appointments would be available seven days a week, through Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust.[10] In August, it was reported that this usage would continue until March 2021.[11] On 12 October, 2020 amidst a rise in cases in Northern England, the hospital was placed on standby.[12] Its closure was confirmed in March 2021.[1] The following have been involved in the creation of the hospital:","Title":"NHS Nightingale Hospital Yorkshire and the Humber - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11324","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Nightingale_Hospital_Yorkshire_and_the_Humber"}
