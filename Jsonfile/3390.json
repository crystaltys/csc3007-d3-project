{"Content: ":"This Nature reserve is located 229 miles from Quito, Ecuador. The reserve includes over 13,000 acres (53 km2) of land in the Shushufindi Canton, Sucumb√≠os Province. There is a large concentration of Fauna in and around the reserve. The over 347 species of bird that live in the reserve make Birdwatching very popular attraction. Limoncocha also holds a large number of tortoises and a diverse population of fish. The park is a largely water environment so a large portion of the Flora in the Nature reserve is either aquatic or semi-aquatic in nature. As with much of Ecuador towering trees provide homes for hundreds of types of animals. The microscopic algae in the water gives it a lemongreen color. Much of the reserve is a lagoon style landscape that was formed by the ancient course of the Napo River. A small community of Quichua also live in the Reserve.
