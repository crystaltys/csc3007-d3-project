{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Lesotho is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Lesotho on 13 May 2020.[2] Prior to this, Lesotho was the last country in Africa to have no reported cases of COVID-19 during the global pandemic.[3][4] The country did not have the ability to test for the virus,[5] and so, in order to prevent the spread of the virus the government closed its border with South Africa.[6] On 18 March, the government declared a national emergency despite having no confirmed cases, and closed schools until 17 April, but allowed school meals to continue. Arriving travellers were to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival.[5] Prime Minister Thomas Thabane announced a three-week lock down from midnight 29 March.[7] Lesotho began sending its samples to South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases for testing.[8] Recorded cases started to increase rapidly in 2021, with revelations that the government had released COVID-19-positive people from quarantine early, as well as cases attributed to workers travelling home from South Africa. On 8 January, South African border authorities estimated that more than 100 Lesotho arrivals a day were testing positive.[9]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Lesotho - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10285","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Lesotho"}
