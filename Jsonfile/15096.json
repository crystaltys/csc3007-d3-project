{"Content: ":"The Legislative Assembly is the legislature of Montserrat. A unicameral body, it has nine elected members. The Legislative Assembly was established following the promulgation of a new constitution in 2011, replacing the Legislative Council.[1] The first elections to it were held in 2014, and the most recent being in 2019. The nine members of the Legislative Assembly are elected in a single constituency, with voters having the opportunity to vote for up to nine candidates under plurality-at-large voting. 1 \"Bailiwick-wide\" legislation passed in the States of Guernsey applies not only in Guernsey, but also in Alderney and Sark, with the consent of their governments. 2 Although Island Councils for Ascension and for Tristan da Cunha exist, which must be consulted, legislation is enacted by Administrators on behalf of the Governor of Saint Helena.
