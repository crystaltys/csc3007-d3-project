It allowed a minority of flights for foreigners wishing to leave to board before completely shutting down its airports on the 22nd.[101] On 21 June 2020, the government re-opened major airports to serve domestic flights only.[102] On 9 July 2020, the government announced that international flights were to resume, with access only for Moroccans or for foreigners residing within the Kingdom. Incoming passengers were required to bring a COVID-19 test result from their country of departure, issued less than 48 hours of the time of arrival.

Students aren't going back to school until September 2020.[citation needed] On 19 March 2020, the Ministry of Interior declared a \"state of health emergency\" and subsequent national lockdown both to take effect on 20 March 2020 at 6:00 pm local time and to initially remain in effect until 20 April 2020 with possibility to extend for a longer period.[108][109][110] The directive allows for the government to impose restrictions on freedom of movement, which includes curfews and travel restrictions, and other preventative measures.[111] The lockdown required the authorisation of local state officials for citizens to leave their homes, while making exceptions for workers at supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, gas stations, medical clinics, telecommunications companies, and essential freelance jobs.[108] A direct 24-hour hotline was set up to \"reinforce direct communication and urge vigilance to fight the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and safeguard the health of citizens.\"[112] In April 2020, the government pardoned 5,654 prisoners, and it put forward procedures to protect inmates from the COVID-19 outbreak.[113] The state of emergency been extended multiple times since then, with Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit presenting successive draft decrees to the government authorizing the extensions, and is currently still ongoing.[114][115][116][117] The state of emergency raised concern from activists and non-governmental organizations, as 91,623 people were prosecuted by 22 May 2020 for crimes which included violating the health emergency law.[118][119] The lockdown in particular was initially enforced and overseen in part by armored vehicles.[120][121] On 22 March 2020, the Ministry of Culture ordered all print newspapers in the country to suspend production and distribution, and suggested they use alternative methods to do so.[122] On 26 May, the government permitted resumption of print publication.[123] According to an article published in Le Desk on 21 April 2020, the Moroccan government outsourced its quarantine strategy to the Boston Consulting Group.[124] On 9 May 2020, the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Moroccan Parliament, approved a law penalizing violations of the state of health emergency with imprisonment of one to three months and a fine of 300\u20131,300 dirhams (approximately US$30\u2013132).[121] On 9 June 2020, the government announced a plan to establish two main zones:[125][126] Note that commercial activities such as cafés, or any sort of event were still prohibited in both zones.[citation needed] The national lockdown was gradually periodically lifted throughout the month of June.[110] In the second half of July 2020, as cases spiked up again (over 10,000 active cases, up from around 200 at the start of the month), the government shifted many regions back to Zone 2, locked down more cities and re-established high-alert quarantine in heavily affected cities. On 21 December 2020, the Moroccan government announced it would impose a nightly curfew, alongside other restrictive measures, to take effect on 23 December as part of its response to the spread of the virus.[127] These were initially announced for a three-week period, but were later also periodically extended alongside the state of health emergency.[128][129] The curfew remained in place throughout Ramadan,[130] and was then shortened by four and a half hours on 22 May.[131] In early 2021, authorities prevented several planned demonstrations from taking place, including a march in solidarity with imprisoned activists Omar Radi and Soulaimane Raissouni, as well as multiple pro-Palestine protests, under the pretext of avoiding \"any violation of the measures of the state of health emergency\".[132][133] A new surge in cases was reported in July 2021, partly due to loose control of health measures in the country, coupled with new variants of the virus, in particular Delta, going from 4,751 cases per day on July 1 to 53,876 on August 1. This prompted the government to retighten health measures, including increasing the duration of the nightly curfew,[134] banning travel to and from Casablanca, Agadir and Marrakech (with the exception of vaccinated individuals and those with a permit),[134] and enforcing the wearing of masks.[135] On 23 August, the government extended the state of health emergency until 31 October at the earliest.[136] The curfew was reduced by 2 hours starting from 11:00 pm on 1 October, in response to a decreasing trend of daily cases as well as the ongoing vaccination campaign.[137] It was eventually lifted on 10 November.[138] In December 2021, the government announced that forthcoming New Year's Eve celebrations would be prohibited, enforcing a curfew from midnight to 6:00 am local time, and ordering restaurants and cafes to close at 11:30 pm.[139][140] On 15 March, King Mohammed VI announced the creation of an emergency fund (labelled as Fonds spécial pour la gestion de la pandémie du Coronavirus (Covid-19)) to upgrade health infrastructure and support the worst affected economic sectors. The fund has a volume of 10 billion dirham ($1 billion).[141] Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news on coronavirus.[142] The government announced that being outside shelter between the hours of 8 pm and 6 am during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan (1441 AH / 2020 BCE) (which started on 25 April) is strictly forbidden for any reason except for special cases, such as logistics.[citation needed]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10259","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Morocco"}
