Tovey was educated at Ilford County High School, the Royal Academy of Music and the University of London. His formal music education was as a pianist and composer. Whilst at the Royal Academy, he also became a tuba player, studying with John Fletcher. During his student years he conducted several broadcasts on the BBC, and also played in the London Symphony Orchestra at the Salzburg Festival.[1] Tovey was appointed a staff conductor of London Festival Ballet at the age of 22, working with Léonide Massine on a production of Parade, Ronald Hynd on Nutcracker and Sanguine Fan and with Rudolf Nureyev on Romeo and Juliet. In 1978 he became Music Director of Scottish Ballet, conducting Peter Darrell's major ballets including Cheri and Five Rückert Songs (with Janet Baker).[1] From 1984 to 1988 he was Principal Conductor of Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet.[2] During this period he also conducted several British orchestras and appeared as pianist in Elite Syncopations.[2] Tovey conducted the first season of the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1988.[3] Between 1989 and 2001, he was the music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra,[4] and was instrumental in establishing the city's annual New Music Festival, which began in 1992.
