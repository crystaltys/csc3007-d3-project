White served as a trustee of Cornell University from 1916 to 1943. White, who was the nephew of Cornell's first President, Andrew Dickson White, left three-quarters of his estate to the University, and that fund had grown to $1.5 million by 1973.[3] In White's honor, in 1973, Cornell named two professorships after him: the first two Cornell faculty to become Horace White Professors were Michael Fisher and Jack Kiefer.[3] He was also active in Syracuse, serving as president of the Post-Standard Company and participating in numerous other civil, social, and business organizations.[2] White once owned Fox Island in the east of Lake Ontario, located in the Town of Cape Vincent. White was the last governor to come from Western New York until Kathy Hochul became Governor after the resignation of Andrew Cuomo in 2021. He was buried at Oakwood Rural Cemetery in Syracuse, New York.[4] ","Title":"Horace White - Wikipedia","KeyID":"4993","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_White"}
