The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council Resolutions. A UN member State, is obligated to respect the United Nations Charter and UN members are bound by its articles. Cyprus claims that Turkey violates the charter against Republic of Cyprus. Turkey does not recognize the continued existence of the Republic of Cyprus, as established by the London and Zurich Agreements[1] Turkey refers to the Republic of Cyprus as the \"Greek Cypriot administration\" or \"South Cyprus\". [2][3] In 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus, after a military coup staged by the Greek Junta against the lawfully elected Government of Cyprus under President Makarios. The Turkish army subsequently occupied ~38% of the territory of the island which to this day remains de facto divided with \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (TRNC) proclaimed in 1983 following a UDI by the Turkish Cypriots. The \"TRNC\" is an illegal entity as per UN Security Council Resolutions UN Security Council Resolution 541 and UN Security Council Resolution 550 and is recognized only by Turkey. The latter has, subsequently, been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for human rights violations in Cyprus. Recommends the creation, with the consent of the Republic of Cyprus, of a U.N peace keeping force.","Title":"List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Cyprus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9415","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_Security_Council_resolutions_concerning_Cyprus"}
