{"Content: ":"The Lemovii were a Germanic tribe, only once named by Tacitus in the late 1st century.[1][2] He noted that they lived near the Rugii and Goths and that they had short swords and round shields.[1][2] The Oksywie culture is associated with parts of the Rugii and Lemovii.[2] Also, the Plöwen group (German: Plöwener Gruppe) of the Uecker-Randow region is associated with the Lemovii.[3] The archaeological Dębczyn group might comprise the remnants of the Lemovii, probably identical with Widsith's Glommas, who are believed to have been the neighbors of the Rugii, a tribe dwelling at the Baltic Sea coast in today's Pomerania region before the migration period.[4][5] Both \"Lemovii\" and \"Glommas\" translate to \"the barking\".[5] Germanic sagas report a battle on the isle of Hiddensee between king Hetel (Hethin, Heodin of the Glommas) and Rugian king Hagen, following the abduction of Hagen's daughter Hilde by Hetel.[4] Yet, there are also other hypotheses about the location of the Lemovii, and that their identification as Glommas, though probable, is not certain.[4] The Lemovii have also been equated with Jordanes' Turcilingi, together with the Rugii with Ptolemy's Rhoutikleioi, also with Ptolemy's Leuonoi and with the Leonas of the Widsith.[5]","Title":"Lemovii - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7832","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemovii"}
