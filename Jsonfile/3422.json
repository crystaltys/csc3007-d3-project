{"Content: ":"Protesters: National Unity Government Supported by: State Administration Council Supported by: Bombings and attacks Protests and government changes Anti-Muslim violence Protests in Myanmar, known locally as the Spring Revolution[11][12] (Burmese: နွေဦးတော်လှန်ရေး, Burmese pronunciation: [nwè.ú.tɔ̀.l̥àɰ̃.jé]), began in early 2021 in opposition to the coup d'état on 1 February, staged by Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, the Tatmadaw.[13] As of 10 June 2022[update], at least 1,929 protesters have been killed and 11,004 currently arrested by the junta. Protesters mostly employed peaceful and nonviolent forms of protest,[14] which include acts of civil disobedience, labour strikes, a military boycott campaign, a pot-banging movement, a red ribbon campaign, public protests, and formal recognition of the election results by elected representatives. The colour red, which is associated with the National League for Democracy (NLD), has been donned by many protesters.[15] \"Kamba Ma Kyay Buu\", a song that was first popularised as the anthem of the 8888 Uprising, has been revitalised by the civil disobedience movement as a protest song.[16][17][18] The three-finger salute has been widely adopted by protesters as a protest symbol.[19] In response to the growing protest movement, the military leaders of the coup enacted a number of countermeasures. These include internet and social media blackouts, a media blackout, pursuit of arrests and criminal sentences against protesters, the spread of disinformation, political overtures to competing political parties to participate in the self-appointed State Administration Council (to replace the elected government body), deployment of pro-military protesters and instigators, and the violent use of force to suppress protests. The 2021 Myanmar coup d'état began on the morning of 1 February 2021 when democratically elected members of Myanmar's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw \u2013 Myanmar's military \u2013 which vested power in a stratocracy, the State Administration Council. The Tatmadaw declared a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been vested in Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing. The coup d'état occurred the day before the Parliament of Myanmar was due to swear in the members elected at the November 2020 general election, thereby preventing this from occurring.[20][21][22] President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi were detained, along with ministers and their deputies and members of Parliament.[23][24] The coup took place amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Myanmar was struggling with one of the most severe outbreaks in Southeast Asia, owing to its poor health infrastructure and ongoing internal conflict. The country had begun its COVID-19 vaccination deployment a few days before the coup.[25][26][27] The country's economy had also been greatly affected by the pandemic, shrinking by 5% during 2020.[28] Representatives elected in the November 2020 elections have not officially recognised the legitimacy of the coup d'état. On 4 February 2021, around seventy MP-elects from the NLD took an oath of office in Naypyidaw, pledging to abide by the people's mandate, and serve as lawmakers for a five-year term.[29] The following day, 300 elected legislators formed a committee to conduct parliamentary affairs, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).[30][31] The committee held its first session on Zoom.[32] On 6 February 2021, several political parties, including the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), the Democratic Party for a New Society (DPNS), the Karen National Party, and Asho Chin National Party, announced they had rejected the military's offer to participate in the State Administration Council.[33] The Karenni National Progressive Party has publicly denounced the military coup and the coup's detrimental effect on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing peace talks, and called for the NLD and Armed Forces to compromise, in order to resolve the country's political stalemate.[34] On 7 February, the parliamentary committee condemned the military coup as a \"criminal act\" and dismissed Min Aung Hlaing's military cabinet as being illegitimate.[30] The committee cited the military with violating Chapter 6 of Myanmar's penal code in overthrowing the civilian government.[30] CRPH has advised UN diplomats and the international community to contact the committee to discuss official government business.[30] On 14 February, the Karen National Union issued a statement announcing its public support for the ongoing protests, and characterised the military's seizure of power as a step toward military dictatorship, contrary to the vision of national reconciliation.[35] On 15 February, the Committee for Shan State Unity, a coalition of Shan ethnic armed groups and political parties that includes the Restoration Council of Shan State, the Shan State Progress Party, the Shan National League for Democracy, and the Shan Nationalities Democratic Party, and the Sin Kyawt Militia, publicly opposed the coup, announcing its support of the ongoing protests, and calling for the abolition of the 2008 constitution and restoration of civilian-led government.[36] On 2 February 2021, healthcare workers and civil servants across the country, including in the national capital, Naypyidaw, launched a national civil disobedience movement (အာဏာဖီဆန်ရေးလှုပ်ရှားမှု), in opposition to the coup d'état.[37][38] A Facebook campaign group dubbed the \"Civil Disobedience Movement\" has attracted more than 230,000 followers, since its initial launch on 2 February 2021.[39][40][41] Min Ko Naing, an 8888 Uprising leader, has urged the public to adopt a \"no recognition, no participation\" stance to the military regime.[42] One expert on the government's civil service system estimated that the country had about one million civil servants and that about three-quarters of them had walked off their jobs.[43] Healthcare workers from dozens of state-run hospitals and institutions initiated a labour strike starting 3 February 2021.[40][27] As of 3 February 2021, healthcare workers in more than 110 hospitals and healthcare agencies[44] have participated in the movement.[39] Six of the thirteen-member Mandalay City Development Committee, including vice-mayor Ye Mon, resigned on 3 February 2021, in protest against the coup d'état.[45] Labor strike participants have faced intimidation and threats from superiors.[46] By 9 February, COVID vaccination had been suspended, the country's testing system had collapsed and most hospitals in Myanmar had shut down.[47][25] The labour strikes have quickly spread to other sectors. Seven teacher organisations, including the 100,000-strong Myanmar Teachers' Federation, have pledged to join the labour strike.[39] Staff in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, formerly led by Aung San Suu Kyi, have also joined the strike.[44] On 4 February 2021, in Naypyidaw, civil servants employed at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation staged a protest.[48] On 5 February 2021, three hundred copper miners at the Kyisintaung copper mines joined the strike campaign.[49] Miner Sithu Tun stated that the strike would continue until the \"elected leaders receive[d] their power back\".[49] By 5 February 2021, the civil service strike included administrative, medical, and educational sector staff and students at \"91 government hospitals, 18 universities and colleges and 12 government departments in 79 townships\".[50] Nan Nwe, a member of the psychology department at Yangon University stated, \"As we teach students to question and understand justice, we can't accept this injustice. Our stand is not political. We only stand up for the justice.\"[51][52] On 8 February, news emerged that state-run newspapers Kyemon and the Global New Light of Myanmar intended to halt publications to protest the coup.[53] On 8 February, all of workers from Myanmar railways participated in the movement and so, the railway transportation is completely stopped. On 8 February, Kanbawza Bank temporarily closed its branches due to staffing shortages resulting from KBZ staff participating in the civil disobedience campaign.[54] Other banks were also impacted by staff participation in the ongoing campaign.[54] On 9 February, staff from the Central Bank of Myanmar joined the movement.[55] On 9 February, the impact of Civil Disobedience Movement activities led the Ministry of Health and Sports to publish a public plea in the state-run New Light of Myanmar requesting healthcare workers to return to work.[56] On 10 February, Myanmar's largest trade union, the Confederation of Trade Unions of Myanmar (CTUM), announced plans to pursue prosecution for workplace officials who retaliate against employees joining the civil disobedience movement.[57] On 11 February, Min Aung Hlaing urged civil servants to put aside their feelings and return to work.[58] On 16 February, a Ministry of Information spokesperson warned civil servants participating in the movement, warning that authorities would not wait long for their return to work.[59] A number of industry lobbying groups, including the Myanmar Mobile Industry Association and the Myanmar Cosmetics Association, have suspended cooperation with government agencies following the coup.[60] From 25 February, truck drivers also began a strike against the coup by refusing to transport goods from the docks at Yangon\u2019s four main ports. Joint secretary of the Myanmar Container Trucking Association said he estimates that about 90% of the 4,000 city's drivers are on strike, and have promised to deliver only essential food, medicine and fabrics for factories.[61] On 3 February 2021, a domestic boycott movement called the \"Stop Buying Junta Business\" campaign emerged, calling for the boycott of products and services linked to the Myanmar military.[62] Among the targeted goods and services in the Burmese military's significant business portfolio include Mytel, a national telecoms carrier, Myanmar Beer, Mandalay Beer, and Dagon Beer, several coffee and tea brands, 7th Sense Creation, which was co-founded by Min Aung Hlaing's daughter,[63] and bus lines.[62] In response to the boycott, 71 engineers working for Mytel in Sagaing Region resigned in protest.[39] Some retail outlets have begun pulling Myanmar Beer from stores.[64] On 5 February, Kirin Company ended its joint venture with the military-owned Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL).[65] The joint venture, Myanmar Brewery, produces several brands of beer, including Myanmar Beer, and has an 80% market share in the country.[65] Kirin's stake had been valued at US $1.7 billion.[65] On 8 February, Lim Kaling, co-founder of Razer Inc., announced he was divesting his stake in a joint venture with a Singaporean tobacco company that owns a 49% stake in Virginia Tobacco, a local tobacco manufacturer that is majority-owned by MEHL.[66] Virginia Tobacco produces two popular local cigarette brands, Red Ruby and Premium Gold.[66] Since the onset of the coup d'état, residents in urban centers such as Yangon have staged cacerolazos, striking pots and pans in unison every evening as a symbolic act to drive away evil, as a method of expressing their opposition to the coup d'état.[67][68][69] On 5 February 2021, thirty people in Mandalay were charged under section 47 of the Police Act for banging pots and kitchenware.[70] On 3 February 2021, healthcare workers in Myanmar launched the red ribbon campaign (ဖဲကြိုးနီလှုပ်ရှားမှု).[71] The color red is associated with the National League for Democracy (NLD), the incumbent political party that won the 2020 elections.[72] Ni Ni Khin Zaw, a popular Burmese singer and medical school graduate, publicly endorsed the campaign.[71] Civil servants and workers across Myanmar, including union-level ministries, have adopted the red ribbon as a symbol of opposition to the military regime.[73] On 5 February 2021, copper miners at Kyinsintaung mines unable to join the labour strike joined the red ribbon campaign.[49] On 6 February 2021, factory garment workers in Thaketa Industrial Zone joined the red ribbon campaign.[74] Burmese celebrities and politicians, including Paing Takhon and Daung, have publicly supported civil resistance efforts, posing with the three-finger salute in social media posts.[75][76] Celebrities and social media influencers, such Sai Sai Kham Leng and Nay Chi Oo, who were silent or were slow to support the ongoing popular protests lost sizeable online followings.[77] On 7 February, Nay Soe Maung, son-in-law of Myanmar's former dictator Than Shwe, posted a Facebook photo demonstrating support for the protests.[78] Burmese netizens have popularised trending hashtags like #SayNototheCoup, #RespectOurVotes, #HearTheVoiceofMyanmar, #SaveMyanmar, and #CivilDisobedience.[79][75] Within a day after the coup d'état, the #SaveMyanmar hashtag had been used by over 325,000 Facebook users.[80] Social media users had also changed their profile pictures to black to show their sorrow or red in support of the NLD, often with a portrait of Suu Kyi.[80] Burmese netizens have also ridiculed Min Aung Hlaing's short stature online,[81] and some pro-democracy netizens have joined the Milk Tea Alliance, an online democratic solidarity movement in Asia.[82] On 17 February 2021, many cars mysteriously broke down in busy streets of Yangon in a staged demonstration, in a creative attempt to block security forces and police to pass through the traffic and to thwart the government workers from going to work.[83][84] The movement continued on 18 February 2021 with many broken-down cars joined by some moving at a very slow speed to block traffic.[84][85] On February 1, 2022, to mark the one year anniversary of the military takeover, Myanmar people took part in a 'silent strike' by staying home, closing down shops and halt all outdoor activities, resulting in streets in many main towns and cities were nearly deserted. The junta have warned participants would be charged with violating terrorism and incitement law.[86] Military lobbyist Han Nyein Oo posted on his Telegram channel about shop owners who have notified on social media that the store would be closed on the day on which the silent strike would be conducted and called for their arrest. More than 200 people were detained by the military council after the post.[87] On 4 February 2021, telecom operators and internet service providers across Myanmar were ordered to block Facebook until 7 February 2021, to ensure the \"country's stability\".[88] Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), a state-owned carrier, also blocked Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp services, while Telenor Myanmar blocked only Facebook.[89][88] Facebook had been used to organise the civil disobedience campaign's labour strikes and the emerging boycott movement.[88] Facebook is used by half of Myanmar's population.[88] Following the Facebook ban, Burmese users had begun flocking to Twitter.[79] The following day, the government extended the social media access ban to include Instagram and Twitter.[90][91] Following the Facebook ban, demand for VPN services surged in the country. According to a UK-based digital privacy and security research group, demand for VPN surged by more than 7000%.[92] The free to use proxy service Psiphon, used to circumvent censorship, has seen its user base surge from 5,000 daily users before the 1 February coup d'état to more than 1.6 million users with an average of 14 million daily connections as of 15 February 2021.[92] On 19 February 2021, most ISPs, Mytel being one of the exceptions, began blocking Wikipedia and other related websites.[93] On the morning of 6 February 2021, the military authorities initiated an internet outage nationwide.[94] That same day, Facebook urged authorities to unblock social media services.[95] Facebook also removed the Burmese government's ability to submit content removal requests.[96][92] Internet access was partially restored the following day, although social media platforms remained blocked.[97] On 14 February 2021, Telenor announced it was no longer permitted to publicly disclose the directives received from military authorities on internet disruptions.[98] Starting on 15 February 2021, the military authorities initiated an internet outage nationwide again from 1:00 to 9:00 a.m. daily.[99][100] Additional internet shutdowns were also reported on 22 and 26 February 2021 in some locations. Mytel, partly shared by the military, was seemingly not affected by the shutdowns.[100] On 1 April 2021, the military council commanded to the wifi internet service providers to cut wireless broadband internet,[101] with fixed-line connections which are disconnected from 1AM to 9AM being the only avenue left to access the internet.[102] Law enforcement authorities have acted swiftly in quelling opposition to the coup. As of 7 February 2021, 152 people were under detention in relation to the coup d'état.[103] The military regime has begun initiating criminal proceedings against detainees. On 3 February 2021, Thawbita, a Buddhist monk was sentenced to two years in prison under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law, for defamation of the military.[104] On 4 February 2021, three university students, Zu Zu Zan, Aung Myo Ko, and Htoo Khant Thaw, were charged under Section 19 of the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law for protesting in Mandalay.[103] On 5 February 2021, Maung Gyi, the chair of the United Nationalities Democratic Party, was arrested, charged and sentenced to two years under Penal Code Section 505(b) for staging a protest in Hpa-an Township, Kayin State.[103] Cho Yu Mon, a school principal, was also arrested and charged under Penal Code Section 505(b) for taking part in a \"red ribbon\" campaign at her school in Hpa-an.[105] NLD leader Win Htein was charged under Section 124(a) of Myanmar's legal code for sedition.[105] On 6 February, Sean Turnell, the Australian economic policy advisor to the NLD-led civilian government and a Macquarie University professor, was detained, becoming the first known foreign national to be arrested in relation to the coup.[106] On 8 February 2021, authorities re-arrested Nang Khin Htwe Myint, Kayin State's chief minister, and Myint Naing, Sagaing Region's chief minister.[107] Nang Khin Htwe Myint had published remarks online urging solidarity between soldiers and the people, pointing out that the army was funded by taxes and state funds, while Myint Naing had posted a speech calling on the public to continue protesting.[107] On 9 February, at least a hundred demonstrators were arrested in Mandalay, including mayor Ye Lwin.[108] On 13 February 2021, authorities have charged and issued arrest warrants under Article 505(b) of the law for seven high-profile individuals,[109] namely Min Ko Naing, Kyaw Min Yu, Mg Mg Aye, Pencilo, Lynn Lynn, Insein Aung Soe, and Myo Yan Naung Thein, for allegedly defaming the state and threatening \"public tranquility\" through their social media posts.[110][111][112][113] On 17 February 2021, authorities issued arrest warrants for several celebrities, namely Lu Min, Pyay Ti Oo, Ko Pauk, Na Gyi, Anegga, and Wyne, for encouraging civil servants to join the ongoing civil disobedience movement.[114] More than 1,700 people had been arrested as of 4 March.[115] On 2 April 2021, eleven individuals were arrested in Yangon after answering questions from a CNN television crew which had received permission to report in Myanmar, with three of these individuals still held as of 19 April 2021[update].[102] On 3 March 2021, Associated Press journalist Thein Zaw and five other media workers were charged over their coverage of the protests, with a potential maximum penalty of three years imprisonment.[116] On 24 March 2021, Thein Zaw was released from Insein Prison near Yangon, with all charges dropped.[117] On 15 April 2021, security forces arrested Wai Moe Naing, one of the most prominent leaders of the protests, near the town of Monywa.[118] On 9 May 2021, the junta returned the body of poet and dissenter Khet Thi, who they said had died in detention.[119] Many of his internal organs had been removed.[119] The military has made overtures to competing political parties in the aftermath of the coup d'état.[33] On 2 February 2021, it formed the State Administration Council, as Myanmar's interim governing body. The Council's membership included several civilian politicians, including Mahn Nyein Maung, a former member of the Karen National Union, Thein Nyunt, and Khin Maung Swe, co-founders of the National Democratic Force, a splinter group from the NLD.[120] On 3 February 2021, five additional civilian members were added to the Council, including Aye Nu Sein, vice-chair of the Arakan National Party.[33][121] On 6 February, the Mon Unity Party had announced it had accepted the military's offer to join the Council.[122] On 8 February 2021, authorities began imposing martial law across several municipalities until further notice.[123] Martial law effectively institutes a nightly curfew from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am, bans gathering of more than five individuals,[124] public speaking, rallies, and protests.[123] Municipalities covered by martial law include seven townships in Mandalay, and a township in Ayeyarwady Region.[123] Martial law has since been expanded to include several urban townships in Yangon, Shwebo, Monywa, Sagaing, Kalay in Sagaing Region, Bago, and Pharsong in Kayah State, where significant protests had emerged.[124] Martial law has since been expanded to include ninety townships in thirty cities, including all the townships that comprise Yangon.[125] On 14 February 2021, the military regime suspended security and privacy protections enshrined in Myanmar's constitution until the state of emergency is lifted.[126][127] The newly passed law enables the Commander-in-Chief to temporarily restrict or suspend the fundamental rights of citizens, including arrests and searches without court-issued warrants, and detentions without court approval.[126] The State Administration Council also enacted Law 3/2021, which requires all residents to register overnight guests outside of their official household with their respective township or ward administrators.[126] The military era law had previously been repealed by the NLD-led government.[126] According to the AAPP, as of 20 January 2022, 1,488 protesters have been killed.[128] The junta's indiscriminate use of force has resulted in the deaths of at least 44 children, including a 7-year-old girl who was shot in her home and reports of hundreds of children and young people detained.[129] On 8 February 2021, police began using rubber bullets, water cannons and tear gas, to disperse protesters at mass rallies.[130] The military leader Min Aung Hlaing ordered a clampdown and suppression of demonstrations as protesters nationwide embarked on a strike. On 9 February two protesters in Naypyidaw were admitted to a local hospital in critical condition, for gunshot wounds.[131] One of these was Mya Thwe Thwe Khine, a twenty-year-old woman, whose death in a hospital on 19 February, became emblematic for the cause of the protesters. In late April, police sources began to claim that the increased violence from apparently among their ranks had actually been the work of military personnel and paramilitary thugs in police uniform, as well as of \"trigger-happy new police recruits\".[132] On 20 February 2021, two protesters were killed and at least two dozen more were injured in Mandalay by the police and military in a violent crackdown. These people were residents of Maha Aung Myay Township guarding government shipyard workers involved in the civil disobedience movement from the police, who were forcing them back to work. In addition to firing live rounds, the police and military personnel also threw rocks, arrested, and used water cannons on civilians, in addition to severely beating many.[133][64][134] Despite international reactions to this incident, the military junta warned protesters that they were willing to continue using such lethal force, and instead claimed that it was the protesters who were \"inciting the people [...] to a confrontation path\". In spite of these threats, huge crowds gathered on 22 February, with some protesters saying that the recent killings had made them more determined to continue protesting.[12] On 25 February, reports showed that police opened fire and used flash bang grenades into a group of residents in Tamwe township protesting the military appointment to replace an administrator in one ward.[135][136] The intensity of the interventions by authorities increased at the beginning of March, with reports of at least 18 fatalities on 28 February according to reports of Human Rights Groups,[137] and an additional 38 on 3 March, with UN special envoy Christine Schraner Burgener describing the day \"as the bloodiest since the coup happened\".[138] Warnings of possible further sanctions were reportedly met with indifference. On 4 March 2021, 19-year-old Kyal Sin was shot in the head during an anti-coup rally, in which security forces fired live rounds to disperse the demonstration.[139] One incident of violence against emergency services personnel was recorded by CCTV and shared on social media, in which an ambulance in the North Okkakapa Township, Yangon was stopped at gunpoint by armed police, and the three volunteer medics were forced out of their vehicles and repeatedly hit in the head with rifle butts and kicked by six police officers, followed by the officers shooting out the windows of the ambulance. The three medics were then detained and sent to the Insein Prison, known for its inhumane conditions.[140][138] On 30 March 2021, numerous airstrikes against protesters in Kayin State were reported.[141] On 9 April, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners and Myanmar Now reported that security forces had killed more than 80 protesters in Bago by firing rifle grenades at them.[142] On 11 April, the country surpassed 700 deaths since the protests began, according to the AAPP.[143] On the same day, a man was shot dead by security forces in Mandalay, becoming the first casualty of the post-ASEAN summit consensus.[144] On 1 June, the Tatmadaw launched airstrikes on many towns in Sagaing and Kachin State against People's Defence Force resistance group.[145] On 5 December, five people were run over and killed by a military vehicle in Yangon.[146] The violent use of force by military forces in Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing's death on 9 February sparked national outrage, with celebrities and public figures such as Thandar Hlaing criticising her treatment.[147] Nyi Nyi Tun, the chair of the Myanmar Motion Picture Organisation, stated \"We cannot witness any more Mya Thwe Thwe Khaings\" and urged the public to join the civil disobedience movement.[148] On 11 February, Mya's sister, Mya Thado Nwe, publicly addressed media outlets, and urged the public to \"uproot the military dictatorship\" for the sake of future generations.[149] On 17 February, a 15 m (49 feet) long billboard depicting Mya's shooting was unfurled off of a pedestrian bridge in Downtown Yangon.[150][71] On 1 March, the CRPH designated the State Administration Council as a terrorist group in response to the violent crackdown on anti-coup protesters on 28 February.[151][152] Vasipake Sayadaw, an influential monk and astrologer who having a close relationship with Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. He has been accused of providing the coup leader with his astrological advice for the takeover. He was reportedly blamed for advising the senior general to tell security forces to shoot protesters in the head. Most of the people killed over the last month were hit in their heads.[153] The Shwekyin Nikāya, Burma's second largest Buddhist monastic order, has also urged Min Aung Hlaing to immediately cease the assaults on unarmed civilians and to refrain from engaging in theft and property destruction.[154][155] Its leading monks reminded the general to be a good Buddhist,[154] which entailed keeping to the Five Precepts required for at least a human rebirth.[b] In March 2021, the State Saṅghamahānāyaka Committee issued a draft statement calling on the SAC to end the violence against protesters, itself vowing to halt its administrative activities in solidarity.[156] On 14 March, it was reported that Bhaddanta Kumārabhivaṁsa (ဘဒ္ဒန္တကုမာရဘိဝံသ), the committee's head, had consequently been detained. Other members as well of the Burmese monastic community have spoken out against the violence and in general opposition to the coup.[157] On 14 February, the military deployed armoured trucks and vehicles in the regional capitals of Yangon, Sittwe, and Myitkyina.[158][159] Soldiers were also deployed on city streets to aid police, including members of the 77th Light Infantry Division.[159] In Yangon, soldiers were deployed to stand behind riot police.[160] On 7 March, state-run media and human rights groups confirmed the occupation of public hospitals, universities and temple compounds by security forces.

The name of pro-Suu Kyi protests was chosen as \"Flower Protests\" due to the use of flowers on her clothing by Suu Kyi.[206] On 8 August, protests took place across Myanmar against the junta on the anniversary of the 1988 uprising. Many protesters chanted \"The old debt from 88, we must get it all in 2021\".[207] On 2 December 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Myanmar security forces deliberately kettled protesters and used lethal force during anti-junta protests in Yangon\u2019s Hlaingthaya Township on 14 March 2021.

The draft is supported by the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. The sole Asian country to co-sponsor this move is South Korea. It also demands the military to \"end the state of emergency\" and immediately stop \"all violence against peaceful demonstrators\". It also calls for the immediate and unconditional release of President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and everyone who has been 'arbitrarily detained, charged or arrested' since the 1 February coup.

A deputy for foreign affairs of the NUG said that ASEAN should negotiate with the NUG, as it \"is supported by the people and has complete legitimacy.\"[241] Members of the NUG were reported to have been in contact with ASEAN leaders, but were not formally invited to the meeting.[242] On 24 April, Min Aung Hlaing attended the special ASEAN Leaders Meeting in Jakarta along with other member states' heads of government and foreign ministers, where he was urged to stop violent crackdowns on protesters. ASEAN released a statement that it had agreed to a \"five-point consensus\" with Min Aung Hlaing on the cessation of violence in Myanmar, constructive dialogue among all parties concerned, and the appointment of a special envoy by ASEAN to facilitate the dialogue process.[243] Demonstrations against him, the coup and asking for restoration of democracy gathered in the streets near the ASEAN Secretariat, where the meeting was held. There have been calls to either suspend or expel Myanmar from ASEAN, though ASEAN member states are prohibited by the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) from interfering in the internal affairs of other members.[244] Later on the same day, a consensus was announced by group chair Brunei where five points were to be met: ending violence, a constructive dialogue among all parties, a special ASEAN envoy to facilitate the dialogue, acceptance of aid and a visit by the envoy to Myanmar. There was no mention, however, of political prisoners.
