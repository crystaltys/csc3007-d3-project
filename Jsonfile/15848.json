{"Content: ":"Luch Design Bureau (Ukrainian: Державне Київське конструкторське бюро «Луч»), located in Kyiv, Ukraine, is a major Ukrainian developer of components for the defense industry.[1] The company is in close co-operation with the Artem holding company, also located in Kyiv. Artem is the main manufacturer of the models developed by the Luch Design Bureau. The company was first established in Ukraine in 1965 and quickly became a leading Soviet developer of automated control systems and diagnostics systems in aviation engineering.[2] 1965 \u2013 development and release for production of PPP-3SM mobile position of preliminary preparation for application (with its location on UAZ car chassis) with air-to-air missiles manual control and PPP-3SAM mobile position of preliminary preparation for application with missiles automatic control system as a basis for creation of further missile automatic control systems for the Air and Navy Forces. 1965-1969 \u2013 creation and release for production of SAK-46 automatic control system for control of air missiles and automatic control and AKIPS-80 test mobile station for control of anti-submarine missiles. In the Soviet Union the mentioned developments were recognized as a first automatic control systems by the State Commissions. 1968-1972 \u2013 development and release for production of \u201cIngul\u201d system (with its location on GAZ-66 car chassis) for preparation for application and maintenance of 9 types of air missiles. 1968-1977 \u2013 development and release for production of automatic test and control mobile stations: - AKIPS-125 for underwater missiles control; - AKIPS-4U for anti-submarine missiles control; - AKIPS-4U1 for torpedoes control. 1969-1977 \u2013 development and release for production of \u201cTrubezh\u201d system for preparation for application and maintenance of 12 types of air missiles. 1975-1977 \u2013 creation of current information aircraft recorder - RIU. 1977-1980 \u2013 development and release for production of \u201cIngul-A\u201d and \u201cTrubezh-A\u201d systems with use of modularity (container) equipment construction for preparation for application and control of 26 types of missiles and guided air bombs (\u201cIngul-A\u201d) and 18 types of missiles (\u201cTrubezh-A\u201d). 1978-1989 \u2013 development and release for production of automatic control and test mobile stations AKIPS-1 and AKIPS-3.2 for control of air anti-submarine missiles. All mentioned stations were put into service by the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union and a number of foreign countries. 1981-1983 \u2013 development and release for production of multipurpose modular \u201cGurt\u201d system which provides the preparation for application of more than 40 types of missiles and their various modifications. The \u201cGurt\u201d system replaced \u201cIngul\u201d and \u201cTrubezh\u201d systems that were in service. In addition to new equipment samples development SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d is actively engaged in modernization and overhaul-period renewal of existing equipment. By the respective coordinated decisions of the ministries of Ukraine the SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d was assigned as a Principal enterprise of Ukraine that conducts and coordinate works on specified life cycle and lifetime prolongation of air, anti-aircraft missiles, mine and torpedo weapon, the \u201cIngul\u201d and \u201cGurt\u201d systems as well as AKIPS stations. Since 1979 SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d has been developing and producing units of servo electric control surface actuators of control systems of air, anti-aircraft missiles and torpedoes. More than ten steering modules with electric actuators were developed for products of various classes which according to their characteristics are highly competitive with the best world analogs. Thus, for example, in 1986 the block of servo electric control surface actuators for R-77 air-to-air missile with lattice control surfaces was created. On the basis of the compact commutatorless electric motors created in Ukraine for the previous decade the SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d developed and has been producing a number of small-sized units of servo electric control surface actuators for the guided tank missiles. Actuators are a part of developed and produced by the SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d digital control systems which provide rounds and missiles precise guidance. Actuators provide high accuracy characteristics, have increased jamming resistance and withstand overloads which take place during firing from guns. Since 2002 the SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d has been supplying (instead of the \u201cGurt\u201d system) the \u201cGurt-M\u201d system which provides: - control and preparation for application of more than 50 various modifications of air missiles and guided air bombs; - final checking of missiles at manufacturing plants; - fault diagnostic during missiles repair; - missiles technical state forecast during overhaul-period renewal. More recently the SKDB \u201cLuch\u201d has been a Principal enterprise that develops conceptually new special military equipment for Ukraine with participation of over than 30 Ukrainian enterprises. Products developed under this program are included in the top-priority category. List of products[3][1]  This Ukrainian corporation or company article is a stub.
