{"Content: ":"The supreme leader (Korean: 최고령도자; MR: ch'oeko ryŏngdoja) of North Korea is the de facto paramount leader of the party, state and army. The title has not been written into the national constitution as a separate office, but it currently states that the president of the State Affairs Commission is the supreme leader of North Korea. Likewise, according to the WPK Charter, the general secretary of the WPK is the supreme leader of the Workers' Party. Formerly, under Kim Jong-il, this title was bestowed on the office of Chairman of the National Defence Commission, who was also the WPK general secretary. General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea is the first priority political position of the supreme leader.[1] That post was titled as Chairman from the founding of the DPRK in 1948 until 1966, General Secretary from 1966 to 2012, First Secretary from 2012 to 2016, Chairman from 2016 to 2022, and General Secretary since 2022. Propaganda workers began calling Kim Il-sung supreme leader in the late 1940s and the term has since been used to describe the status of Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un. Generally however, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il were both referred to as \"Great Leader\" (위대한 수령) and \"Dear Leader\" (친애하는 령도자) respectively during their tenures as leader.[citation needed]","Title":"Supreme Leader (North Korean title) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14764","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_leader_of_North_Korea"}
