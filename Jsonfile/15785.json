{"Content: ":"Lysychansk (Ukrainian: Лисича́нськ [lɪsɪˈtʃɑnʲsʲk]; Russian: Лисича́нск [lʲɪsʲɪˈtɕansk]) is a city in the Sievierodonetsk Raion of the Luhansk Oblast in Ukraine. Prior to 2020 municipal classification reforms, it was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It is located on the high right bank of the Donets river, approximately 115 km from the oblast capital, Luhansk. It faces Sievierodonetsk across the river. Its population is approximately 95,031 (2021 est.).[2] Lysychansk is currently controlled by Russia and the Luhansk People's Republic. The administration of Lysychansk Municipality includes the cities of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia. Together with the cities of Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna and the nearest towns, the Lysychansk area constitutes a major urban and industrial hub of the Donbas area, with a population of about 353,000 (2009). During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city was the site of major fighting during the Battle of Lysychansk, which ended with the capture of the city by Russian forces on 2 July.[3] In 1721, coal was discovered in the Donets basin near Lisya Balka, a Cossack village established in 1710.[4] In 1795, Lysychansk was the first coal-mining settlement of the Donets basin.[4] Previously existing settlements in the area around Lysychansk were completely destroyed by the Muscovy punitive expedition against the Bulavin Rebellion. After suppressing the uprising, the area was resettled with Voronove (founded by Khokhlov's Cossacks), Syrotyne (Popov's and Sirotin's Cossacks), Borivske (partly settled by former residents of the burned the Borovskaya Sloboda), Metiolkine (Metelnikov's Cossacks) and Smolianynove (Smolkin's Cossacks).[citation needed] \"Old Town\", Komsomolskaya Street, 1932 The first coal mine \"Old Town\" Damaged building in Lysychansk, 2014 A local newspaper has been published in the city since January 1918.[5] The present borders of Lysychansk were finalized by the mid-1960s. In 1962, the city of Sievierodonetsk separated from Lysychansk and became its own independent city. In 1963, the towns of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia were included in the city limits of Lysychansk and became cities. In 1965, Lysychansk incorporated the cities of Verkhnie and Proletarsk.[citation needed] During the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine the town was captured early April 2014 by pro-Russian separatists.[6][7] On 22 July 2014 Ukrainian Ukrinform reported that the separatists \"massively left Lysychansk\" with \"seized cars from the population and in parking lots;\" Russian ITAR-TASS reported the same day that the separatists had \"decided to leave the town in order to save the population and stop clashes.\" This was mainly because their defeat in the Siege of Sloviansk and the evacuation of Kramatorsk made holding the city untenable.[8][9] The next day heavy fighting continued around the town while the Ukrainian National Guard and the Ukrainian army released a statement that stated \"the military plan to free Lysychansk, Luhansk region, from terrorist groups in the near future.\"[10][11] On 24 July 2014 the Ukrainian army claimed its troops had entered Lysychansk and its Col. Andriy Lysenko stated \"We will take the town, and the road will be open to Horlivka, then Donetsk.\"[12][13] On 25 July 2014, Ukrainian forces secured the city from the pro-Russian separatists.[14] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lysychansk came under heavy shelling from the Russian military. Some of the most intense strikes occurred late in March 2022, which destroyed dozens of buildings and caused civilian casualties.[15] On 9 May 2022, Russian troops attempted to cross over the Seversky Donets river with a temporary pontoon bridge near Bilohorivka.[16] Ukrainian forces anticipated this approach, monitored the bridge construction, bombing the bridge and Russian vehicles who already crossed resulting in severe Russian losses.[17] Russia made several such attempts, many of which were neutralized by Ukrainian forces.[18] After the Russian capture of Sievierodenetsk, Lysychansk became the last major city in the Luhansk region under Ukraine. On 26 June, TASS reported that Russian forces entered the city from five directions.[19][20] On 27 June, the CNN reported that civilians in Lysychansk have been urged to leave immediately, as Russian forces gain ground in the city.[21] On 2 July 2022, reports of Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the city and Russian forces moving in were supported by multiple videos from Kadirov's 141st Special Motorized Regiment declaring victory in front of the City Council of Lysychansk. \"After heavy fighting for Lysychansk, the defence forces of Ukraine were forced to withdraw from their occupied positions and lines,\" the army general staff said. Earlier Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces had captured Lysychansk and taken full control of Luhansk region. Ukraine's troops were outgunned there. Its general staff said that \"in order to preserve the lives of Ukrainian defenders, a decision was made to withdraw\".
