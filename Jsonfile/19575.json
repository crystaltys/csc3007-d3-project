He signed an entry-level contract with the Devils on March 29, 2004.[13] Due to the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, Parise spent his first professional season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Albany River Rats.[13] In his first professional season, Parise scored 18 goals and added 40 assists.[4] He was chosen to play in the 2004\u201305 AHL All-Star Game.[4] Parise made his debut in the NHL at the start of the 2005\u201306 season.

On March 2, 2011, Parise was cleared to start skating and returned to play on April 2, the same night the Devils were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. On July 29, 2011, Parise signed a one-year contract worth $6 million with the Devils.[23] On October 5, 2011, the Devils named him captain. Parise became the second captain in Devils history (the other being Scott Stevens) to lead them to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Devils were down 0\u20133 in the series before finally losing in six games at the hands of the Los Angeles Kings. On July 4, 2012, Parise left the Devils' organization to sign with his hometown Minnesota Wild. Parise noted that his parents played a role in him signing with the Wild, stating \"When I made the decision they were real excited as well. That played a big part. I grew up here, I love coming back here in the summers and I thought 'We enjoy it here so much it would be great to be here year round.'\" Parise's father, J.P., once captained the Minnesota North Stars. The Wild signed Parise, as well as fellow free agent Ryan Suter, to identical 13-year, $98 million contracts.[24] Parise chose to wear No. 11, the same number his father wore as a North Star; Parise's No. 9 he wore with the Devils was already worn by team captain Mikko Koivu. On July 9, both Parise and Suter were named alternate captains.[25] Parise scored 18 goals along with 20 assists during the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season. The Wild qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in five years as the eighth seed in the Western Conference.

Parise was booed every time he skated with the puck, especially when his name was announced for a goal. The Wild ended up losing the game 4\u20133 in overtime.[27] On November 6, 2014, it was announced that Parise was out \"indefinitely\" due to a concussion he suffered two days earlier during a 4\u20131 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins.[28] Five games later, on November 16, he returned to the Wild lineup.[29] He finished the season with 62 points. The 2015\u201316 season brought a host of struggles for Parise, who struggled through a sprained MCL at the beginning of the season, before injuring his back near the end of the season. In a game against the San Jose Sharks, Parise sustained a hit from Logan Couture that further aggravated the injury, taking him out for the rest of the season and the Wild's short playoff run. Even with the injuries, Parise led the team in goals and was second in points. He also led the NHL with a total of three hat tricks on the season.[30] On October 23, 2016, Parise scored 2 goals to earn his 300th goal in his career, in a loss against the New York Islanders.[31] Parise played his 1,000th career NHL game on February 7, 2020, in an away game against the Dallas Stars.[32][33] On February 24, 2021, Parise scored his 800th NHL point in the Wild's 6\u20132 win over the Colorado Avalanche.[34] On July 13, 2021, the Wild bought out the remaining four years of Parise's contract.[35] On September 10, 2021, Parise signed with the New York Islanders.[36] On March 21, 2022, he signed a one-year contract extension with the team.[37] Although Parise's father J.
