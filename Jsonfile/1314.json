{"Content: ":"In botany, a section (Latin: sectio) is a taxonomic rank below the genus, but above the species.[1] The subgenus, if present, is higher than the section, and the rank of series, if present, is below the section. Sections may in turn be divided into subsections.[2] Sections are typically used to help organise very large genera, which may have hundreds of species.[1] A botanist wanting to distinguish groups of species may prefer to create a taxon at the rank of section or series to avoid making new combinations, i.e. many new binomial names for the species involved.[1] Examples:  This botany article is a stub.
