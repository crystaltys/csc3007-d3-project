{"Content: ":"The United Nations Secretariat Building is a 505-foot (154 m) tall skyscraper and the centerpiece of the headquarters of the United Nations, in the Turtle Bay/East Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, alongside the East River. Although it remains geopolitically located within the United States, the lot where the building stands is considered to be under United Nations jurisdiction.[3] It is the first skyscraper in New York City to use a glass curtain wall.[4] The building was designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. One notable feature outside the building is a circular pool with a decorative fountain in its center, which was a gift from the children of the United States, paid for by small donations in schools from all across the country.[5] The building is connected to the Conference Building (which houses the General Assembly), the Security Council, and the Dag Hammarskjöld Library. It houses the administrative functions of the UN, including day-to-day duties such as finance and translation. As part of the UN complex, the building is subject to an agreement between the United Nations and its host country, the United States.[6] The groundbreaking ceremony for the Secretariat Building occurred on September 14, 1948.[7] A consortium of four contracting companies from Manhattan and Queens were selected to construct the Secretariat Building as part of a $30 million contract.[8] The 39-story Secretariat Building was completed in 1950, making it the first new structure at the UN Headquarters.[5] Staff started moving in as early as August of that year and it was fully occupied by June 1951.[9][10] The UN Secretariat Building was renovated starting in May 2010, and reopened in phases with the first occupants moving in July 2012.[11] On October 29, 2012, the basement of the UN complex was flooded due to Hurricane Sandy, leading to a three-day closure and the relocation of several offices.[12] The building style has inspired the construction of other glass curtain wall buildings in Manhattan, such as Lever House, Corning Glass Building, and Springs Mills Building.[13] The 2nd Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld in front of the General Assembly building with the Secretariat Building in the background Illustration of the Secretariat Building on a 1975 Brazilian stamp At dusk Building facade","Title":"United Nations Secretariat Building - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9366","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat_Building"}
