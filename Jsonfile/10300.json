{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Benin is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Benin in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[2][3] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[4][5] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[6][4] Model-based simulations for Benin suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t diminished to around 0.6 during the second half of 2021.[7]  COVID-19 vaccination in Benin is an ongoing immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country. As of 28 June 2021, Benin has administered 36,188 doses, 26,268 people with one dose and 9,920 people fully vaccinated.","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Benin - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10300","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Benin"}
