{"Content: ":"Sunset Season is the debut extended play by American singer-songwriter and social media personality Conan Gray. It was released under Republic Records on November 16, 2018. Sunset Season was primarily produced by Dan Nigro and co-produced by Conan Gray, who also wrote and composed the five-track EP. Gray released \"Idle Town\", \"Generation Why\", and \"Crush Culture\" as singles. The EP peaked at number two on the US Heatseeker Albums chart, and at number 116 on the Billboard 200 chart. The EP received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the production, lyrical content and Gray\u2019s vocal performance. Gray has cited Lorde's debut album, Pure Heroine, as a major inspiration for the EP because of its small-town nostalgia.[1] In November 2019, Gray took to Twitter to celebrate the one year anniversary of the EP's release, stating \"can't even begin to explain how much these five songs changed my life, so i\u2019m not even going to try to. just. i'm happier now than i've ever been my whole entire life. so thank u.\" The tweet featured a screenshot of the EP's growth on Spotify, showing that it had gained over 145 million streams in one year.[2] Credits adapted from Tidal.[3] All tracks are written by Conan Gray","Title":"Sunset Season - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3164","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Season"}
