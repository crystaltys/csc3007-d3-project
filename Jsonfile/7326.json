{"Content: ":"Eurovision Home Concerts are a series of online concerts produced as an alternative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The concerts are broadcast on the contest's official YouTube channel every Friday from 3 April to 15 May 2020, a day before the 2020 contest's scheduled grand final and the broadcast of its live replacement show, Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light. Each episode features at-home performances by past contestants of the Eurovision Song Contest, including those who were supposed to compete at the cancelled 2020 contest. The artists performed their Eurovision hits, as well as a cover of one of their favourite other entries from their homes.[1] For their cover, each act gave a shortlist of 2\u20134 entries for fans to choose in an online poll on Twitter or Instagram, and covered the song (or songs if there was a tie) that won the poll.[2]","Title":"Eurovision Home Concerts - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7326","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Home_Concerts"}
