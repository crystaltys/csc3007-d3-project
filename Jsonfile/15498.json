While Ukrainian officials believe the victims were killed over sending supplies and information to the Ukrainian army, church officials believed the incident was religious persecution.

The rebels seized four cars belonging to the men.[4] The detainees were charged by the militants with \"crime against the DRP\", which was expressed in support of the Ukrainian army.[4][5][clarification needed] It was determined that they were detained in the basement of the city fire department.

About 4:00 am on June 9 the car with detainees had been shot by rebels. It is believed that to hide the extent to which the brothers were tortured, the car was burned.[1] Advisor of the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Anton Gerashchenko [uk] assumed that the attackers were trying to make it seem that death of the passengers was caused by mortar fire of the Ukrainian military.[7] According to Freedon Vekua (Ukrainian: Фрідон Векуа) who was deputy mayor of Slavyansk on Humanitarian Affairs at that time, on the morning of June 9 information about the death of the four people was announced at closed meeting of the heads of the DRP.[8] According to Anton Gerashchenko, the rebels' leader Igor Strelkov condemned the murder and the men who performed the crimes were reprimanded.[7][9][better source needed][10] Victor Bradarskiy's widow Natalia said that on June 10 she had been told by the city police department that her husband was among the men taken by the rebels, and she was allowed to provide food and medicine for her husband. According to her, rebels stated through representatives that the detainees were serving sentences, digging trenches near the village of Semenovka (a suburb of Kramatorsk) and would be released soon. In early July, there were reports by relatives of detainees that the four men were previously released.[11] Member of Human Rights Watch Yulia Gorbunova (Ukrainian: Юлія Горбунова) said locals claimed that the bodies of unidentified people were taken to the morgue, where the remained until 11 June, after which they were buried in a mass grave.[12] According to Anton Gerashchenko, the burned car remained on the sidelines and was later identified as belonging to B.

The rest of the cars of the killed men were seized by rebels and driven from Slavyansk during the withdrawal of DRP's forces.[9] On July 7, after Slavyansk completely passed under the control of Ukrainian soldiers, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Arsen Avakov and his deputy Vasyl Pascal (Ukrainian: Василь Паскаль) who arrived in the city. Natalia Bradarskaya asked them to help her to find the missing.[11] On July 14, Anton Gerashchenko said that exhumation of bodies from the mass grave was conducted, and that the bodies had signs of tortures and abuses.[13] Among the found 14 bodies, were the bodies of Pavenko brothers and V. Bradarsky, identified by remnants of their clothing. The severely charred body of Velichko was identified later by DNA profiling.

There was evidence that they helped support the rebels, including storing ammunition in the church.[16] On the other hand, Christian Science Monitor newspaper correspondent Scott Peterson said that the killers were not Ukrainians, but were pro-Russian separatists.[15] According to the Advisor of the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Anton Herashchenko, the killed men were accused of sending food to checkpoints of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and the National Guard, as well as possibly informing the Ukrainian military about insurgent activities.[9][17] There were rumors that the killed men brought chemical or biological weapons to Slavyansk.[11] However, relatives deny that the men cooperated with the Ukrainian army.[18][15] Correspondent of the Financial Times Guy Chaz also called the accusations of collaboration with the AFU false.[19][full citation needed] Among other theories was that the men were kidnapped for ransom, however, according to witnesses, church officials believe that religion was the only cause of the deaths.[20] The father of Pavenko brothers was a businessman; he owned furniture factory and the \"Semyonov\" sausage manufactory. Shortly before the crime, a batch of steel structures arrived at one of the family factory of Pavenko; perhaps this was the source of rumors about weapons being delivered to the Ukrainian army.[21] The murder is cited as a main example of religious persecution in the DRP.[22][23][24] Ukrainian BBC correspondent Svetlana Dorosh called the murder the most high-profile crime against priests, committed during the Russo-Ukrainian War.[25][full citation needed] The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the US State Department has included this incident in the list of examples of Protestants persecution in the territory uncontrolled by the Ukrainian authorities.[2] The theory of religious persecution was documented in the joint report of the International Partnership for Human Rights (Brussels), the human rights organization \"Center for Civil Liberties\" (Russian: Центр гражданских свобод) (Kyiv)[26][full citation needed] and in the publications of the Russian philosopher Nicholas Karpitsky (Russian: Николай Карлицкий) living in Ukraine.[27][full citation needed][28] After the Charlie Hebdo shooting, when the Je suis Charlie (French: I am Charlie) slogan widely spread on the Internet, the Ukrainian blogger and public figure Denis Kazansky published the post \"We all are Protestants from Slavyansk\", offering it as a variant of the solidarity slogan.
