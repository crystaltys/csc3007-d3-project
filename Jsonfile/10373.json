{"Content: ":"The following is the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. The table below documents the daily growth and change of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries and RT-PCR tests in Nepal, since the first confirmed case on 23 January 2020: A 31-year-old student of Wuhan University who had returned home on 5 January,[582] was admitted with mild symptoms on 13 January and discharged on 17 January with instructions to self-quarantine at home, after preliminary tests showed he may not be infected.[583] Public laboratories did not have the reagents required for testing, which cost around Rs 17,000 per test and need to be bought in bulk. As there were no other suspected cases needing testing, the officials elected to send the samples to Hong Kong for testing.[584] The samples were sent on 21 January,[585] and the results came back positive on the 24 January.[586] The patient was confirmed completely treated when RT-PCR throat swabs returned negative for COVID-19 in followup assessments of 29 and 31 January.[587][588] On 17 January, urged by the WHO, Nepal began screening passengers arriving in Tribhuvan International Airport from China, Thailand and Japan, the three countries with multiple confirmed cases.[589] Eight persons manned the health desk. The airport did not have infrared scanners and was therefore using thermal scanners as preparations were being made to install the infrared ones. The passengers who showed fever were being asked to remain in contact and visit the hospitals if they showed additional symptoms.[590] On 23 January, Dr. Bashudev Pandey, director of Teku Hospital, was quoted as saying that the hospital was on high alert, while three other hospitals \u2013 Nepal Police Hospital, Patan Hospital and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital \u2013 would also treat the disease.[591] Six beds in Teku Hospital had been allocated for isolation of suspected patients.[590] On 25 January, a day after the first case was confirmed, the Health Ministry informed that two other suspected patients were in isolation at Teku Hospital.[592] The hospital discharged them in the morning of 27 January without waiting for test results even though the results were due later that same day, raising concerns over its handling of the crisis. The tests which confirmed a negative result for both patients were conducted at the bio-safety level-2 labs of the National Public Health Laboratory, the first such tests to be performed in Nepal. Reagents sufficient for 100 tests were borrowed from the Centre for Molecular Dynamics, and test kits were provided by the World Health Organisation.[593] On 28 January, Nepal closed down the Rasuwagadhi border with China, bringing Nepal-China trade to a complete halt.[594] Bordering districts of India were reported to be in high alert, and medical personnel had been deployed to various entry points along the Indo-Nepal border.[595] By the first week of February, Nepal reported a shortage of face masks, as people hurried to buy them.[596] Districts bordering India began setting up health desks at border crossings.[597][598] The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division reported that it had devised its own treatment protocol based on the one developed by UN Health Agency and directed all private hospitals to strictly follow the guidelines.[592] By 1 February, Teku Hospital had handled five suspected cases, all of whom tested negative.[599] On 4 February, the Minister for Health informed that three hospitals had been made capable of testing for the virus, and 43 beds had been made available for patients of the possible outbreak. He also informed that health desks had been setup in Pokhara, Chitwan and Bhairahawa.[600] On 5 February, Nepal donated 100,000 protective masks to China as a gesture of friendship.[601] A village in Sindhupalchok District reported hundreds of cases with fever, cough and difficulty breathing, starting on 10 February.[602] On 12 February, the district ruled out COVID-19 based on travel history of the people in the village.[603][604] Laboratory testing later confirmed the outbreak to be influenza.[605] As of 13 February, Nepal had tested on 19 suspected patients. The Health Ministry said it would start using police to guard suspected patients after a Saudi national admitted to Teku Hospital fled from isolation.[606] Nepal evacuated 175 people, mostly students, who had been stranded across Hubei,[607] on 16 February, using a Nepal Airlines chartered aeroplane[608] and placed them in a 14-day quarantine at Kharipati in Bhaktapur. Although 180 Nepalis had applied for immediate evacuation from China by 2 February, the effort took almost two weeks, as the government struggled to meet WHO's evacuation standards, and to find a suitable venue for quarantine. The government was criticised for its slow response; a Public interest litigation was filed at the Supreme Court,[609] while the locals around the designated quarantine site in Bhaktapur protested the government's decision which they viewed as endangering to the local community.[610][611][612][613] On 19 February, the Health Ministry reported that all of the evacuees had tested negative.[614][615] On 18 February, the Chinese Embassy in Nepal criticised The Kathmandu Post for republishing a Korea Herald piece critical of China's handling of the pandemic, accusing editor-in-chief Anup Kaphle of anti-China bias. In response, 17 editors from Nepalese mainstream press released a joint statement expressing concern about the singling out of the editor, and reminding the Chinese Embassy of diplomatic norms and constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the Press in Nepal; The Kathmandu Post published an editorial criticising the Embassy's actions. The Chinese embassy's actions were seen as uncharacteristic and surprising, as China is known for non-interference in Nepal's internal affairs.[616][617][618] By the end of February, the health desk at Tribhuvan International Airport was screening passengers from China, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but did not have sufficient manpower and equipment to screen all new arrivals. A total of six infrared scanners had been setup; the only thermal scanner had yet to be repaired, but plans were underway to purchase three more.[619] Passengers were not being asked to fill locator forms that would make it possible to track them down later.[620] It was also reported that the government was seeking help from the UN, having failed to procure masks and protective gear due to global shortages.[621] On 29 February, the government formed a high level committee to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishwor Pokhrel.[619] The government also decided to suspend promotional activities for Visit Nepal 2020.[622] Nepal suspended labour migration to South Korea.[623] India started screening passengers from Nepal and making masks compulsory for all visiting Nepalis.[621] It was also screening Nepalis travelling into India by land, at various checkpoints at the border.[624] Nepal announced suspension of visa-on-arrival service for nationals of five countries badly affected by COVID-19 \u2013 China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran \u2013 to be enforced from 7 to 30 March.[a][626][627][628] It also urged the general public to avoid large gatherings.[622] The passengers and crew involved in the evacuation of Nepalis from Hubei were released from quarantine after all tests again came back negative following a two-week quarantine.[628] The Supreme Court issued an interim order to suspend flights to and from countries affected by the disease, in response to a public interest litigation.

Health checkpoints were to be established at all major entry points from India and third country citizens would be allowed to cross from select border check-points only.[625] Due to a severe shortage of face-masks and protective gear as well as increase in price following a ban on export in China and India, some hospitals were reported to be sewing plain clothes masks as a precaution.[629] A shortage of hand sanitisers was also reported.[630] Qatar imposed a temporary ban on arrivals from Nepal and other countries, affecting almost 40,000 labour migrants with valid work permits who were yet to leave.[631] Nepal Airlines and Himalaya Airlines suspended their flights to Doha indefinitely following the ban.[632] The government expanded the suspension of visa-on-arrival service to include three additional countries \u2014 France, Germany and Spain.[633] Nepal decided to suspend on-arrival tourist visa for all countries, with an exception to diplomatic and official visas, to last from 14 March till 30 April.
