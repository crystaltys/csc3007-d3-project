{"Content: ":"Fang Fang (Chinese: 方方) is the pen name of Wang Fang (汪芳; born 11 May 1955), a Chinese writer, known for her literary depictions of the working poor. She won the Lu Xun Literary Prize in 2010. Born in Nanjing, she attended Wuhan University in 1978 to study Chinese. In 1975, she began to write poetry and in 1982, her first novel was published. She has since written several novels, some of which have been honored by Chinese national-level literary prizes.[1] Fang garnered international attention for her Wuhan Diary, documenting the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and has used her platform to call for an end to internet censorship in China.[2] During the 2020 Hubei lockdowns, Fang Fang used social media to share her Wuhan Diary (武汉日记), a daily account of life in the locked-down city of Wuhan. In addition to her own writing, Wuhan Diary utilized anonymous interviews with other people in the city.[3] The account drew international public attention.[4] The English version of Wuhan Diary, translated by Michael Berry, was published as an e-book and audiobook by Harper Collins on May 15, 2020 and released in hardcover on November 24, 2020.[5] Within China, Fang Fang has faced criticism, being labeled as a \"traitor\" by users on social media platforms such as Weibo. She has continued writing, however, some of her works have been blocked from publication due to her perceived criticism of the Chinese government.[6] She was on the list of the BBC's 100 Women announced on 23 November 2020.[7]","Title":"Fang Fang - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11460","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang_Fang"}
