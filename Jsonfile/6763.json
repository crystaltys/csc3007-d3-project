Cushman & Wakefield was founded in New York City on October 31, 1917, by brothers-in-law J. Clydesdale Cushman and Bernard Wakefield.

George Healey founded the firm in 1910, taking building leases near Regent's Park during the construction of Regent Street. He was joined by partner George Henry Baker, who joined the firm in 1910, and whose name was added to the firm's in 1920. Baker initiated the firm's focus on commercial property. In 1994, C&W worldwide partnership was established with real estate services firms in the U.S., Europe, Asia, South America, Mexico, and Canada. In 2001, Cushman & Wakefield acquired Cushman Realty Corporation (CRC), increasing its presence on the West Coast and Southwest United States, bringing CRC founders John C. Cushman III and Louis B. Cushman back to the firm founded by their grandfather, J. Clydesdale Cushman and great-uncle, Bernard Wakefield. John C. Cushman became Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Louis B. Cushman, Vice Chairman.

The new Cushman & Wakefield is majority owned by an investor group led by TPG, PAG, and OTPP.[15] The two companies combined for $6 billion in revenues and 45,000 employees. In 2016, the two engaged in more than $191 billion in commercial real estate transactions and approximately 4.3 billion square feet under management.[16] In October 2017, Chaney Brooks became an alliance partner with Cushman & Wakefield establishing a foothold in the Hawaii & Guam markets by partnering with one of the oldest commercial real estate firms in the islands.[17] In March 2018, Cushman & Wakefield had debts amounting to $3.1 billion, an increase of $300 million compared with the end of 2017.
