{"Content: ":"Opposition party Other members The House of Assembly is the legislature of Dominica. It is established by Chapter III of the Constitution of Dominica, and together with the President of Dominica constitutes Dominica's Parliament. The House is unicameral, and consists of twenty-one Representatives, nine senators, and the Attorney General as an ex officio member. The Speaker of the House becomes the thirty-second member if chosen from outside the membership of the House. Representatives are directly elected in single-member constituencies using the simple-majority (or first-past-the-post) system for a term of five years. The Representatives in turn decide whether the senators are to be elected by their vote, or appointed. If appointed, five are chosen by the president with the advice of the Prime Minister and four with the advice of the Leader of the Opposition. The current Senators are appointed. The Cabinet of Dominica is appointed from members of the House of Assembly. However, no more than three senators may be members of the Cabinet. Since the election held on 6 December 2019, the Dominica Labour Party holds 18 of the 21 directly elected seats, and the opposition United Workers' Party holds three elected seats. The new House of Assembly included a record eight women.[2] The following Senators were appointed for the parliamentary term beginning 10 February 2020:[4] Coordinates: 15°17\u203242\u2033N 61°23\u203207\u2033W﻿ / ﻿15.2951°N 61.3852°W﻿ / 15.2951; -61.3852","Title":"House of Assembly of Dominica - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14995","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly_of_Dominica"}
