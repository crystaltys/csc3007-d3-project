{"Content: ":"The National Council (French: Conseil national) is the parliament (legislative body) of the Principality of Monaco. The body is composed of twenty-four members, who are elected from lists by universal suffrage. Councillors serve for five-year terms, and though it may act independently of the Prince, he may dissolve it at any time, provided that new elections be held within three months. The Council meets at least twice per year to vote on the country's budget and bills proposed by the prince's government. Ordinances (executive orders) are debated in the Council of Government, and once approved, must be submitted to the Sovereign Prince within eighty days for his signature, which makes them legally enforceable. If he does not express opposition within ten days of submission, they become valid. The current president of the national council is St√©phane Valeri.
