{"Content: ":"Russia began an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. It is the largest military attack in Europe since World War II.[1][2][3] During the fighting many pieces of Ukrainian cultural heritage were either destroyed, damaged or put at risk due to the widespread destruction across the country.[4] Cultural property enjoys special protection under international humanitarian law.[5] Protocol I of the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (both binding on Ukraine and Russia) prohibit states parties to use historic monuments in support of the military effort and to make them object of acts of hostility or reprisals.[5] The Second Protocol to the Hague Convention allows attacks on cultural property only in case of \"imperative military necessity\" when there is no feasible alternative. Attacks against cultural heritage amount to war crimes and can be prosecuted before the International Criminal Court.[6] There are seven United Nation Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) world heritage sites in Ukraine, which include the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, and an entire quarter of Lviv.[7] Additional sites in Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Chernihiv, were being considered for nomination to the world heritage status but were not added prior to the invasion.[8] In late April 2022, it was reported that Ukraine had registered the shipwreck of the Russian cruiser Moskva as an \"underwater cultural heritage\" site.[9] The director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in Kyiv, Fedir Androshchuk, worked with two colleagues to conserve and safe guard the museum from attack and potential looting. Androschuck also reported that four other museums in Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Chernihiv had managed to remove, store and protect their main exhibitions with the museum in Vinnytsia used as a displaced persons housing.[7] An artist collective; Asortymentna kimnata (Assorted Room) that is based from the Ivano-Frankivsk Contemporary Art Center, created several bunkers and worked with galleries in Kyiv, Mariupol, Odesa, Zaporizhzhya and elsewhere to evacuate and preserve pieces from the galleries.[10] Many monuments and memorials are protected with bags of sand or wrapped in various materials. In Kyiv, approximately 28 objects were protected in this way as of mid-April.[11] Residents in Lviv attempted to help preserve several stone statues and fountains that could not be dismantled, by wrapping them in plastic, foam and other materials. Additional efforts were photographed and posted by the Lviv Foundation for the Preservation of Architectural and Historical Monuments of wooden frames and boards being used to protect monuments and church stained glass windows.[12][11] On 28 March an NFT museum launched by the Ministry of Digital Transformation to help preserve the statehood and history of Ukraine, with all proceeds to go to the ministry. The site, Ukrainian MetaHistory NFT-Museum, would include a \"warline\" or timeline of events with a corresponding NFT, which would include a tweet regarding a significant moment in the war and an illustration by a Ukrainian artist. By 1 April, about $600,000 had been raised through the sale of the NFTs, with the funds slated to help rebuild museums, theaters and others cultural institutions that had been destroyed or damaged.[13][14] Many of cultural heritage objects being protected in Ukraine from Russian invasion are objects of Russian culture.[4][10][15] Shortly after the invasion, UNESCO announced that they were working to mark any possible key historic monuments and sites across the country with the emblem of the 1954 Hague Convention, the internationally recognized symbol for the protection of cultural heritage in an armed conflict. The organization would also work with the country's museum directors to coordinate conservation efforts to protect collections and monitor any damage to cultural sites through satellite imaging.[16] Cultural institutions in Poland offered aid, through the Committee for Aid to Museums of Ukraine which was created shortly after the invasion. The Committee offered support to all museums and cultural institutions in Ukraine to support and secure their collections as well as documentation, digitalization and inventory of collections.[10] The aid from other institutions continued throughout the war. In May 2022 the Czech Ministry of Culture commissioned the National Museum of Prague to send packing materials such as bubble wrap and polyethylene foam along with safety equipment such as fire extinguishers and oriented strand boards to block windows.[17] The Ukrainian Cultural Center in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, California hosted an arts fundraiser which highlighted works by Ukrainian artists in LA in an art exhibit and silent auction as well as a concert, which included the work of late Myroslav Skoryk. Organizers stated that all proceeds will be donated towards humanitarian aid in Ukraine, and hope that the cultural heritage and language would be passed on to another generation.[18] Others, both refugees and transplants, have embraced traditions and traditional clothing during holidays, outside of Ukraine to show support and resilience against the invasion.[19] During a Milan furniture fair in June 2022, Ukrainian designers Victoria Yakusha and Kateryna Sokolova, highlighted the cultural heritage and symbolisms of Ukraine with their pieces. Sokolova stated her pieces were created in an effort to avoid \"Ukrainian design being wiped off the world map\" while Yakusha claims her mission is to \"show the world the creativity and beauty of Ukrainian culture and thus assert the identity.\"[20] On 15 July, UNESCO reported full or partial damage of at least 163 objects: 71 religious buildings, 12 museums, 32 historical buildings, 24 buildings dedicated to cultural activities, 17 monuments and 7 libraries.[21][22] This list contains only cases known from multiple credible sources.[22] At the same time, Ministry of Culture of Ukraine reports 423 cases of damage or destruction of cultural objects, including 147 religious buildings, 46 memorials, 59 cultural centers, theaters and cinemas, 40 libraries and 33 museums. 21 of them are regarded as memorials of national significance. About 100 objects are destroyed completely or almost completely.[21] Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab at Virginia Museum of Natural History found evidence of 458 damaged cultural sites as of 10 June 2022.[23] On 25 February 2022,[24] Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum about fifty miles from the capital burnt to the ground after Russian bombardment.[25] The museum contained folk artwork, including paintings by Maria Prymachenko and textile works by Hanna Veres.

Most exhibits from the Museum of Local Lore and Kuindzhi Art Museum had been removed by Russian occupation forces.[57] However, the director of the Mariupol Local History museum; Natalia Kapustnikova, told a pro-Kremlin news outlet, Izvestiya, that she had handed over the works of Aivazovsky and Kuindzhi to Russian forces, \"following the end of the hostilities\".[58] In May 2022, Ukrainian officials claimed that Russian forces looted the \"largest and most expensive\" collections of Scythian artefacts in Ukraine from Melitopol.[50] Volunteers internationally are working to archive Ukrainian cultural heritage digital content that is at risk of destruction due to the Russian invasion of 2022.[59] The Internet Archive is supporting various preservation efforts, including the initiative Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO), started on 1 March 2022.[60] SUCHO began after three academics from Stanford University, Tufts University and the Austrian Center for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage connected on Twitter in late February 2022. The group moved to expand the use of the Internet Archives Wayback Machine which only documents the homepage, and utilized grants from the Association for Computers and the Humanities and European Association for Digital Humanities as well as Amazon and DigitalOcean. In the first two weeks of the initiative, more than 1,500 websites, digital exhibits, open access publications and other online resources from Ukrainian cultural organizations had digital archives made, which accounted for about three terabytes of data.[61] The project Backup Ukraine was announced in May 2022, and is working in partnership with VICE Media Group's Virtue, the Blue Shield Denmark and the Danish UNESCO National Commission. The project asks volunteers to use an app to scan objects in Ukraine, which are then turned into a 3D model and uploaded into a cloud data base to be backed up. Scans already uploaded to the project include every day items such as bedrooms and pets along with works of art.[62] Some academics such as a lexicographer and lecturer of Ukrainian language at Columbia University have raised concerns that due to the continued destruction of Ukrainian culture by Russian forces the destruction is targeted in an attempt to destroy Ukraine even if Ukraine wins the war. These concerns were echoed by the director of UNESCO World Heritage Center, who stated, that Ukraine was not only losing part of its cultural heritage but its identity and part of its history would disappear if the war was not ended.[63] Additional concerns were raised by a US Special Rapporteur on Cultural Rights who warned that the questioning and denial of the Ukrainian identity and history through the war, comments made by Russian authority figures and the destruction of Ukrainian cultural heritage, would have lasting effects.[64] The Chair of Blue Shield Denmark issued a press release highlighting the concern of a countries cultural heritage being destroyed as the fastest way to undermine the national identity.
