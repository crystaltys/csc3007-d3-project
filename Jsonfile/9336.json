On 7 June 2021, he was elected as the 76th president of the United Nations General Assembly with an overwhelming three-fourth majority, with 143 in favour, 48 against and no abstentions and no invalid votes.[1] The session of the assembly is scheduled for every year starting in September\u2014any special, or emergency special, assemblies over the next year will be headed by the president of the UNGA. The presidency rotates annually between the five geographic groups: African, Asia-Pacific, Eastern European, Latin American and Caribbean, and Western European and other States.[2] Because of their powerful stature globally, some of the largest, most powerful countries have never held the presidency, such as the People's Republic of China, France, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In particular, it is customary that no permanent member of the United Nations Security Council ever serves as UNGA president. The only modern countries that had a national elected as president of UNGA twice are Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Nigeria; all the other member states had been represented only once by their nationals holding this office, and Germany had a national elected once as Federal Republic of Germany and once as German Democratic Republic. This does not include special and emergency special sessions of UNGA.","Title":"President of the United Nations General Assembly - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9336","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_Nations_General_Assembly"}
