{"Content: ":"Robert Byron Tabor (1882\u20131972) was an American painter. He began his painting career when he was 51 years old. His artwork has been featured in the Museum of Modern Art, the Joslyn Art Museum, the White House, and other places. Tabor's first major artwork was Vendue in 1934 and his last major one was Discovery in 1962. Tabor was born in Independence, Iowa, in 1882. In 1933 and during the Great Depression, Tabor had to leave his traveling paint salesman job in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At the time, he was 51 years old with a wife and three children in Independence. Tabor's reproduction of Winslow Homer's 1885 painting The Herring Net was damaged that same year, when it dropped from its nailed spot on his wall. Tabor decided to replace the painting with one of his own, and his family had no enthusiasm for it due to him having no artistic experience. He began painting several days later by using oil paints and canvas, but his first projects were thrown away by him as failures.[1] He died in 1972 in Olathe, Kansas, when he was 90 years old.[2][1] After gaining respect for his painting from his family, his wife Ruth read a December 1933 newspaper article about the formation of the Public Works of Art Project. The Public Works of Art Project paid artists weekly, but applicants had to show their artistic abilities. The Iowa branch of the art project was run by painter Grant Wood, and Wood allowed Tabor to join despite not liking Tabor's paintings. Wood said that it was \"against his better judgment\" and that he could not \"turn anyone down in times like these\".[1] Trabor revealed his painting Vendue a month later, and the painting depicted an Iowa farm being sold. Vendue was part of a competition with 15,000 other paintings, with it later being part of a Corcoran Gallery of Art exhibition in 1934 with 600 other works. Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife saw Vendue at the exhibition, leading to them choosing to display the artwork at the White House, with it likely being there until the late 1940s or early 1950s.[1] At some point before the Roosevelt display, Vendue was shown at the Museum of Modern Art. An article, in the 1956 issue of the magazine Coronet, stated that Tabor's inspiration for Vendue was from farm owner Joseph McGrady of Independence. The original painting is missing.[1] His paintings have been shown at the Joslyn Art Museum.[2] Tabor was hired to paint a mural for the Independence post office named Postman in Storm. His other artwork included Main Street which is displayed in Independence's library and The Four Seasons on an Iowa Farm for Hotel Pinicon in the same city. In 1962, Tabor's final major painting was Discovery, which featured physicist James Van Allen and Allen's three co-workers discovering the Van Allen radiation belt.[1] Olathe News said in 1964 that Discovery is the \"only recording\" of the Van Allen radiation belt discovery. Tabor founded an art society in Oelwein, Iowa. Toward the end of his life, Tabor continued to paint and worked to create an art guild in Olathe, Kansas.[3]","Title":"Robert Byron Tabor - Wikipedia","KeyID":"23","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byron_Tabor"}
