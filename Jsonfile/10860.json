{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand has had far-reaching consequences on the country that went beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to eliminate it, including education, faith communities, Māori, mass gatherings, sports, recreation, and travel. In addition, there were several recorded cases of lockdown violations, leaks, and misinformation about the COVID-19 virus and vaccines. On 17 March 2020, Logan Park High School in Dunedin closed for 48 hours after one of its students tested positive for the coronavirus.[1][2] On 23 March, several schools in Auckland including Marist College, Randwick Park School and Glendowie College closed after several teachers and parents tested positive for the coronavirus.[3][4] That same day, the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand called on the Government to shut down all schools immediately.[5] In response to a spike of cases and the upgrading of New Zealand's coronavirus Alert Level to Level 3, the Government closed down all schools and early childhood centres.[6] On 13 May, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the end-of-year high school National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) external exams would be postponed from 6 to 16 November 2020.[7] On 26 August, Auckland's Secondary Principals' Association announced that secondary schools were planning catch-up classes and holiday lessons for students whose education had been affected by the city's lockdown.[8] On 8 September, St Dominic's Catholic College in Auckland's Henderson suburb announced that it would shut down for a \"deep clean\" for three days after it was reported that a student tested positive for COVID-19 that same day.[9] On 16 September, Chapel Downs Primary School in Auckland's Manukau suburb closed for the rest of the week after a student tested positive for COVID-19.[10] On 9 November, Otorohanga College closed down its hostel after health authorities confirmed that a traveller from Wellington who had tested positive for COVID-19 had visited the facility while travelling through Otorohanga and Kawhia in the Waikato region.[11] In mid-February 2021, Papatoetoe High School in Auckland's Papatoetoe suburb closed after a Year 9 student was identified as one among three new community cases. In addition, five teachers and 28 students at the school were identified as close contacts of the infected student while all other students and staff at the school were considered \"casual\" contacts.[12] By 17 February, two more Papatoetoe students had tested positive for COVID-19, with the younger sibling being a close contact of the index case.[13] On 23 June 2021, Whitby Collegiate in Porirua closed for the rest of the week after confirming that eight staff members had visited the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa on 19 June around the same time as an Australian visitor who later tested positive for COVID-19. These staff members had visited Te Papa in order to prepare for a senior school ball.[14][15] During the Delta variant community outbreak in mid\u2013August 2021, several cases were reported at schools in Auckland including Avondale College, Pukekohe High School and Western Springs College.[16][17] On 25 August, the Ministry of Education and TVNZ relaunched a home learning television channel \"Home Learning TV/Papa Kāinga TV\" to provide learning support for parents in response to the lockdown following the Auckland Auckland community outbreak. The channel will be hosted on TVNZ's DUKE +1 daytime schedule from 9am to 1pm. Hosts include Suzy Cato and Karen O'Leary.[18] On 26 August, the Ministry of Education announced that National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) achievements at high schools would be delayed by two weeks to 22 November due to the disruption caused by the Level 4 lockdown that month. The Education Ministry has also indicated that they might reintroduce Learning Recognition Credits depending on how long the lockdown lasted. The Secondary Principals' Association and several principals and secondary students welcomed the delay of NCEA exams.[19][20] While many secondary students welcomed the postponement of NCEA exams, the sisters Ruby and Lucy Reid opposed the changes on the grounds that it would cause students more stress and disrupt the plans of students working summer jobs. They organised a petition calling for the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) to reconsider the decision. By 28 August, this petition had attracted 22,000 signatures.[20][21] On 17 September, Education Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed that there would be no changes to end of the year school holiday dates across the country including Auckland. The Government ruled out extending the length of Term Four since this was the period at the end of the school year when most school students would be most tired. This announcement came following calls by the National Party's education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith to move the school holidays forward.[22] In mid-September, the Ministry of Health did not allow school students in Auckland (which was then under Level 3 restrictions) to return to board schools in other regions. Parents have complained that these schools are no longer providing remote learning, causing their children to miss out on school. Radio New Zealand estimated that about 150 families the in Auckland's Pukekohe suburb were affected by these travel restrictions. There were also reports of delays of students experiencing delays in getting their border exemptions processed by authorities.[23] In mid-September, Otago Boys High School in Dunedin confirmed that it was working with health authorities to investigate whether a boarding student from Auckland had traveled without seeking a travel exemption.[24][25] In mid October, the Government announced that secondary schools in Auckland would reopen on 26 October for Year 11 to Year 13 students. Several principals including Whangaparāoa College principal Steve McCracken and Albany Senior High School principal Claire Amos expressed concern about the Government's decision to reopen schools amidst spreading community transmissions.[26] In late October 2021, Hipkins confirmed that Education officials are aiming to reopen primary and intermediate schools in Auckland for Year 1 to Year 8 students by 15 November. However, he also clarified this was only an \"indicative date\" based on \"events closer to the time\" in Auckland. The National Party education spokesman Paul Goldsmith has called for Auckland primary and intermediate schools to be reopened immediately.[27] On 10 November, Hipkins announced that all students in the Auckland and Waikato regions would be able to return to school from 17 November. Year 9 and 10 students would be able to return on a fulltime basis while most students in Years 1-8 would be returning part-time.[28][29] In mid-November 2021, the private education provider Villa Education Trust announced plans to establish an online private school, issuing a recruitment call to both vaccinated and unvaccinated teachers. The Trust's academic adviser Alwyn Poole attributed the launch of the private school to the shift towards online learning following the August 2021 pandemic and providing a career pathway for teachers who had chosen not to get vaccinated and hence lost their jobs due to the Government's vaccine mandate. The online school will be run out of Mt Hobson Middle School and will cater to Years 5-13 initially. The fees will be under NZ$10,000. Poole confirmed that at least 50 families had expressed interest in the school.[30] In early December 2021, the Ministry of Education confirmed that more than 130 education facilities in Auckland have had a staff member or student contract Covid-19 since the start of the Delta outbreak in August 2021. This includes 56 early learning services, 45 primary schools, and 30 composite or secondary schools.[31] On 14 December, the Ministry of Education reported a surge in homeschooling applications from parents, rising to 3,225 applications by 8 December. As of early December 2021, 8,552 children were in homeschooling; compared with 7,749 in mid 2021 and about 1,300 in mid 2020. Auckland Home Educators director Adrian Koit attributed the growing interest in homeschooling to the long lockdown in Auckland that year and parental concerns about Government efforts to rollout vaccines to children aged over 12 years old in September 2021.[32] On 15 December, 11 community cases were reported at Eltham Primary School in the South Taranaki district of Eltham. South Taranaki district councillor Mark Bellringer criticised the school authorities for not closing the school following the first case.[33] On 25 January, Education Minister Hipkins confirmed that the Government had ordered 5,000 air purifiers for New Zealand schools to help filter the COVID-19 air particles. The first 500 purifiers are scheduled to arrive in March while the rest will arrive in the winter of 2022.[34] Under the red setting of the COVID-19 Protection Framework (\"traffic light system\") which came into effect in late January, teachers, staff, and students in Year Four and above will be required to wear approved face masks.[35] On 2 February, principals reported that a growing number of parents were planning to homeschool their children due to a Government mandate requiring children in Year 4 and above to wear facemasks indoors. Radio New Zealand reported that the Education Ministry had received 735 homeschooling applications in January 2022, 800 in December 2021, and 867 in November 2021. The Education Ministry had also approved 2,655 homeschool applications last year, declined 78 and was still processing 983 applications. Of these applications, 900 were from Auckland, 500 from Canterbury, and 400 in Waikato.[36] On 7 February, several schools across the North Island reported positive cases among their students and staff. These schools included Te Mata Primary School in Hastings' Havelock North suburb, Hamilton Boys' High School, Hamilton Christian School, Rototuna Junior and Senior High School, Melville Intermediate School and Prospect School in Auckland's Glen Eden suburb.[37][38] On 13 February, a positive case was reported at Musselburgh School in Dunedin. All Year 5 and Year 6 students at the school were identified as close contacts with families being asked to get their children tested. The school remained opened for Years 1 to 4 stuents.[39] By 18 February, several Otago and Southland schools including Carisbrook School, Bradford School, Balmacewen Intermediate School, Otago Boys' High School, Columba College, Wakatipu High School, and Gore Main School had reported positive cases.[40] On 22 February, King's and Queen's High Schools in Dunedin had reported positive cases. By that date, several schools in Queenstown and Gore had reported cases of COVID-19.[41] By 24 February, the Ministry of Education confirmed that 717 schools and early childhood centres were dealing with at least one COVID-19 case. This figure included 168 early childhood centres, 370 primary schools, 45 intermediate schools, and 134 high schools. Following the transition into phase 3 of the New Zealand Government's Omicron response plan, schools would no longer be required to identify close contacts of cases but are still required to report cases to officials.[42] On 25 February, Education Minister Hipkins clarified that unvaccinated children and teenagers would be allowed to participate in school sports and extracurricular activities under phase 3 of the country's Omicron response plan. He also clarified that the vaccine pass and vaccine requirement would not be required for those participating in school organised activities.[43] In mid\u2013May 2022, several health experts including Amanda Kvalsvig and Michael Baker from the University of Otago urged the Government to develop a COVID-19 Action Plan to combat COVID-19 during the 2022 winter. Their proposals included mandatory mask wearing at schools, ensuring that classrooms were ventilated, and providing support and special sick leave for infected staff and students.[44] Several teachers' unions including the New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI), the Secondary Principals' Association, and Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) expressed concerns about staff having to take time off due to COVID-19, burn-out, and post-COVID-19 illness. The NZEI President Liam Rutherford called on the Government to introduce special pandemic sick leave to due with the high number of staff isolating due to COVID-19.[45] By 17 June 2022, schools across New Zealand were reporting a high rate of sick leaves and a critical shortage of relief teachers due to COVID-19 and winter illnesses. The New Zealand Principals' Federation national president Cherie Taylor-Patel estimated that about 20% of the teaching workforce were absent on a daily basis.[46] The following day, Prime Minister Ardern confirmed that she was consulting health experts on reintroducing mask mandates to schools in response to a surge of COVID-19 and seasonal flu patients at hospitals nationwide.[47] In late July 2022, figures released by the Ministry of Health indicated that school attendance during Term One of 2022 had plummeted to 46.1% during the Omicron outbreak in early 2022. By comparison, school attendance was 64% in Term Four of 2021, 66.8% in Term 1 of 2021, 5-/5% in Term 1 of 2020, and 72.8% in Term 1 of 2019. According to The New Zealand Herald, 120,000 students (roughly 15% of the school population) had contracted COVID-19 in March 2022.[48] On 25 July 2022, the leaders of ten regional principals' associations released a joint letter calling on the Government to reveal how it would help high school students pass their National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) exams. The joint letter expressed concern about the impact of the disruption of COVID-19 and the winter flu on student well-being and educational achievement. The letter also expressed concern about student disengagement and high truancy rates.[49] On 17 March 2020, the University of Canterbury became the first university in New Zealand to recall its exchange students from overseas, stating that \"Given the rapidly escalating global situation and the increasing amount of travel restrictions worldwide, and intensive consultation with our partners, [we have] made the very difficult decision to suspend our exchange programmes and recall all UC outbound exchange students, effective immediately.\"[50] On 20 March, Massey University stopped face-to-face teaching of courses that could be taught by distance.[51] The University of Auckland suspended classes for the week of 23\u201327 March to allow staff to prepare for remote teaching in the event of a partial campus closure.[52][51] The University of Otago in Dunedin has also shifted classes with more than 100 students online while students at the University of Canterbury have petitioned for all classes to be moved online.[53] On 21 March, Auckland University of Technology announced that it would be suspending teaching in response to a petition from students.[54] The University of Canterbury also announced they could move to online learning.[55] On 23 March, all universities suspended physical lectures and shifted to online learning in response to the Government's imposition of an Alert level 3 lockdown.[6] On 14 April, the Government released a tertiary support package but it was considered unsatisfactory by tertiary students and student associations.[56][57] Several university halls of residence including Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Otago were criticised for continuing to charge rent from students, who had left their accommodation during the lockdown to isolate with their families.[58][59] Other universities like the University of Waikato waived rent for unused accommodation.[60] Green Party MP Chlöe Swarbrick criticised these universities' practices and successfully lobbied for a parliamentary inquiry into student accommodation.[61] In September 2020, the University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Dawn Freshwater announced plans to resume on-campus teaching on 21 September. Following criticism from Director-General Bloomfield and students, the University retracted its decision and delayed plans to resume on-campus teaching until 5 October 2020.[62][63] On 12 October 2020, the Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government would be introducing a new border exemption allowing 250 international PhD and postgraduate students to enter New Zealand. These students will undergo the two-week mandatory quarantine.[64] On 11 November, the New Zealand Police confirmed that they were investigating an anonymous post on the controversial social media platform 8Chan by an individual claiming that they were seeking to deliberately spread COVID-19 among students taking their final year exams at the University of Auckland.[65] On 12 November, the University of Auckland shifted all exams at its Auckland Central campuses (City, Grafton, Newmarket, and Epsom) scheduled for Friday online following the discovery of a community transmission in the city centre.[66] On 25 February 2021, the University of Otago in Dunedin called on returning students from Auckland to self-isolate in response to the Auckland February community outbreak. 650 first-year students had arrived in Dunedin for the start of the academic year.[67] During the Delta variant community outbreak in mid\u2013August 2021, Auckland University of Technology experienced several COVID-19 cases.[68] By 23 August, seven AUT students had tested positive for the Delta variant.[69] By 25 August, several locations at the University of Auckland including lecture theatres, the Whitaker and Waipuru residential halls, and a Munchy Mart convenience store were identified as areas of interest in the Delta community outbreak.[70] On 29 September, the University of Otago confirmed that it was considering implementing voluntary redundancies due to declining international enrolments, rising salary costs, an ongoing significant capital expenditure programme, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[71][72] On 29 January, the Otago University Students' Association cancelled all large events for the Orientation Week scheduled for February 2022 due to \"red light setting\" restrictions limiting public gatherings to 100 people with vaccine passes.[73] In response to rising Omicron cases in February 2022, the University of Auckland and the University of Otago announced that lectures would be held online during the first semester. The University of Canterbury however announced that it would hold both online and physical lectures.[74][75] Union of Students' Associations president Andrew Lessells stated that the rising COVID-19 cases among tertiary students was causing stress among students.[75] On 18 February, Stuff reported that many international tertiary students were reconsidering their study plans in New Zealand due to the country's border restrictions. Many Chinese international students who had previously been attending secondary school in New Zealand prior to the border closure in 2020 were ineligible to participate in China's gaokao college exams. JJL Overseas Education New Zealand education agent Janet Wong stated that the Government's planned reopening of the border in 2022 was \"too little, too late\" for many students and parents, who had decided to study in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada instead.[76] In mid-March 2020, several faith communities and denominations including the Catholic Church, the Supreme Sikh Society, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and LIFE church announced that they would be cancelling or reducing large gatherings and taking more health precautions in response to the Government's ban on gatherings with more than 100 people. However, Bishop Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church initially refused to close their services, with Tamaki stating that they would not let a \"filthy virus\" scare them out of attending church.[77] In response, infectious diseases expert Dr Siouxsie Wiles criticised Bishop Tamaki for undermining efforts to keep New Zealanders safe.[78] Smaller congregations like Elim Church and C3 Church in Marlborough have halved services in order to comply with the Government's ban on gatherings with more than 100 people while the Nativity Church has set up networks to support parishioners.[79] On 20 March, the New Zealand Catholic Bishops' Conference declared that all public Masses would be suspended for the foreseeable future. This decision was made in line with the government's decision to cancel mass indoor events with more than 100 people.[80] On 29 March, it was reported that members of the exclusive Gloriavale Christian Community were not complying with lockdown measures and that daycare centres, schools, and meetings were still ongoing. The police have since announced that they are working with Gloriavale to make sure that its members abided with lockdown restrictions.[81] In late March 2020, there were reports that members of the Muslim community in New Zealand were having trouble accessing halal food due to the closure of butcheries, which were not deemed an \"essential service\" under Alert Level 4.[82][83][84] Under the Government's Alert Level 2 restrictions which came into force on 14 May, religious gatherings have been limited to ten persons despite the Government stating that they could have a 100-person limit. The Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ) issued a press release that New Zealand Muslims would be unable to hold their Eid prayers at mosques and community centers due to the ten person limit on private gatherings.[85] The Catholic bishops of New Zealand have expressed disappointment with the ten-person limit, describing the measures as too restrictive.[86] Meanwhile, Bishop Tamaki of Destiny Church has announced that his movement would be holding services in defiance of Level 2 lockdown restrictions.[87][88] The New Zealand Muslim Association President Ikhlaq Kashkari has expressed disappointment that the ten person limit will prevent mosques from gathering for Ramadan. The Minister of Commoners Weslyan Methodist Community Reverend Frank Ritchie has also criticised the perceived double standard towards faith communities.[89] On 25 May, the Government raised the limit on religious services from ten to 100 persons, allowing many faith communities to resume mass gatherings.[90][91][92] On 29 August, 1 News reported that several members of Mount Roskill Evangelical Fellowship Church had continued to meet privately despite the Level 3 lockdown that had come into force in the Auckland Region between 12 and 30 August.[93] Health authorities had earlier identified the church as a sub-cluster of the Auckland August cluster.[94] On 31 August, Health Minister Chris Hipkins announced that health authorities were investigating claims that the church held meetings during Auckland's Alert Level 3 restrictions. Microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles also said that genome sequencing would be used to prove whether cases at the church were linked to the Auckland cluster. 15 COVID-19 cases have been linked to the Mt Roskill church sub-cluster.[95] On 10 September, several Christian leaders including Pacific Response Coordination Team chairman Pakilau Manase Lua and Wesleyan Methodist minister Frank Ritchie expressed concern about misinformation relating to COVID-19 circulating among New Zealand congregants attending churches with links to conservative evangelical and Pentecostal churches in the United States.[96] On 18 August 2021, the Central Auckland Church of Christ was identified as a location of interest during the Delta-variant community outbreak.[68] On 23 August 2021, the Samoan Assemblies of God Māngere church in South Auckland was identified as a location of interest. An individual who later tested positive for COVID-19 had attended a service attended by 500 people on 15 August. Other churches linked to the Auckland cluster have included St Anthony Church and St Therese Church. Health Director-General Ashley Bloomfield confirmed that church leaders were cooperating with health authorities.[97] [98] By 24 August, 58 cases had been linked to the Mangere Assemblies of God church members. According to Auckland councillor Efeso Collins, the predominantly Pacific Islander congregants had received racist abuse.[99] By 7 October 2021, 386 people linked to the Māngere church sub-cluster had tested positive for COVID-19. Following the death of a congregant on 6 October, local Samoan Assemblies of God denominational leaders including First lady Rebekah Toleafoa and church spokesperson Jerome Mika called for members to vaccinate.[100] In early October 2021, The Spinoff reported that several faith communities and leaders including the Hindu temple Sri Venkateswara in Wainuiomata, Temple Sinai synagogue in Wellington, the Wellington Anglican Diocese, the evangelical Christian Rice youth movement, Muslim chaplain Tahir Nawaz, and the Auckland Buddhist Centre had adopted online communications technologies including Zoom, YouTube, and WhatsApp since lockdown restrictions had made it hard for many faith communities to hold physical gatherings and meetings.[101] By 7 November 2021, the entire 120-member congregation of Sāmoan Methodist Māngere Central church in Auckland had been vaccinated due to an awareness campaign promoted by the church's Reverend Suiva'aia Te'o and youth group leaders. During Level 4 and Level 3 restrictions, the church livestreamed its services on Facebook and held Bible studies and prayer meetings via Zoom. In addition, the church ran Kahoot! quizzes and online talent shows aimed at young people.[102] In early November 2021, Radio New Zealand reported that many Auckland churches and leaders including GraceCity Church and Windsor Baptist Church were preparing to deliver Christmas services online due to lockdown restrictions. Radio NZ also reported that several church leaders including Windsor Park senior pastor Grant Harris, GraceCity senior pastor Jonathan Dove, and New Zealand Catholic Bioethics Centre director John Kleinsman were pondering the ethics of only admitting vaccinated people once the traffic light system comes into force. Life Church senior pastor Paul de Jong has objected to any government legislation or restrictions that would exclude people based on their vaccination status.[103] In early October 2021, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins acknowledged that the Government had granted two Mongrel Mob members Sonny Fatupaito, the leader of the Waikato chapter, and life member Harry Tam essential worker exemptions to travel in and out of Auckland the previous weekend. Both men had been granted exemptions to enter Auckland to facilitate contact tracing and testing among gang members. Hipkins confirmed that several gang members were part of the August 2021 cluster.[104][105] The Government's decision to give gang members travel exemptions was criticised by National Party leader Judith Collins and ACT party leader David Seymour.[106] In late October 2021, Radio New Zealand reported that the Delta outbreak in Auckland and Waikato had worsened the country's housing crisis, leading the number of children living in motels to rise from 280 to 4,512 over the past three months. Minister of Social Development Carmel Sepuloni confirmed that there had been an increase in demand for emergency housing during the Delta outbreak, particularly in Auckland and Waikato. Sepuloni also acknowledged that COVID-19 restrictions made it harder for people to move in with family or friends while searching for a new place, others were unable to return home because of alert levels, and that family breakdowns had led to increase demand for emergency accommodation. In addition to Auckland and Waikato, there was an increase demand for emergency housing in the Gisborne District, Bay of Plenty, and Northland regions particularly Whangārei. As of 29 October 2021, the New Zealand Government has spent NZ$87.7 million dollars on 36,330 emergency housing grants over the past three months.[107] In early July 2020, National Party MP Hamish Walker admitted leaking the private details of COVID-19 patients to the media.[108] Former National Party President Michelle Boag had passed the information to Walker in her capacity as chief executive of the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust.[109] Walker was stripped of his portfolios and later announced that he would not be contesting the 2020 general election.[110] Boag, who also admitted leaking similar information to National MP Michael Woodhouse, resigned from her position with the Helicopter Trust and her membership of the National Party.[111] On 18 August 2020, managed isolation and quarantine deputy chief executive Megan Main confirmed that a First Security guard had leaked information about the names, room numbers, and travel itineraries of returnees staying in managed isolation at Auckland's Sheraton Four Points managed isolation facility on Snapchat. Main apologised for the privacy breach. She confirmed that the guard had been removed from duty at the hotel and that First Security was conducting an employment investigation into the guard.[112] That same day, The New Zealand Herald reported that a man had admitted spreading a rumour on Reddit that a recent outbreak of community transmissions in Auckland in mid-August had been caused by a family member supposedly entering a managed isolation facility. This rumor was dismissed by health authorities.[113] After New Zealand entered into a level 4 alert lockdown on 25 March 2020, there were several reports of people violating lockdown rules by congregating in crowds. On 1 April, Ardern described 20\u201329 year olds as the most vulnerable demographic to COVID-19 and called on them to comply with lockdown requirements.[114][115] On 2 April, there were reports of beachgoers congregating in Auckland's Herne Bay, and Dunedin. Police have visited beachgoers, warning them to comply with the lockdown, while health authorities have warned about the risk of spreading the coronavirus and prolonging the lockdown.[116] In Otago, there have been reports of people jumping off the Albert Town Bridge near Wanaka.[117] In Auckland, Tongan ethnic community leaders have also warned that kava clubs are still meeting despite the lockdown, with some participants posting photos and videos on social media.[118] In Kaitaia, there have been reports of locals taking matters into their own hands by establishing checkpoints to enforce the lockdown.[119] In early April, Health Minister David Clark was criticised for flouting official guidelines against non-essential travel after he drove to a Dunedin park two kilometres away from his home to ride a mountain bike trail. Clark later apologised to Prime Minister Ardern for not setting a good example to the public.[120][121][122] Later, Clark admitted that he had driven his family twenty kilometres to a nearby beach in Dunedin for a walk during the first week in lockdown. Clark offered his resignation to Prime Minister Ardern, who turned it down due to his role in leading the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, she stripped Clark of his ministerial portfolio as Associate Finance Minister and demoted him to the bottom of Labour's Cabinet list.[123] In early April, a Christchurch man was arrested by police after posting a Facebook video of himself deliberately coughing and sneezing on customers at a FreshChoice supermarket. Ardern warned that people would be arrested for deliberately coughing on others.[124][125] The man pleaded guilty to a charge of offensive behaviour in the Christchurch District Court. He received a negative test for COVID-19. The man later apologised for his actions.[126][127] On 7 April, it was reported that the New Zealand Police had recorded 291 breaches under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 and the Health Act 1956. Of these, 263 people had been issued with warnings for breaking lockdown rules, 12 had received a youth referral, and 16 were facing charges. Clark, who was disciplined by the prime minister for violating lockdown requirements, was not listed among the 291 breaches reported.[128][129] On 8 April, the Police Commissioner Andrew Coster updated the figures to 367 breaches including 45 prosecutions, 309 warnings, and 13 youth referrals. Coster also reported that police were dealing with 37,000 breaches, mainly by businesses.[130] On 21 April, a Queenstown man was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of one month imprisonment and two weeks' imprisonment for breaching lockdown restrictions and damaging a stainless steel toilet.[131] In Auckland, a 32-year-old woman who allegedly spat at Auckland Transport staff on a train was charged with assault under the Crimes Act 1961. Auckland Transport has reported of incidents of stopping people trying to travel from outlying suburbs like Henderson and Takanini to shop in the city centre and groups of young people travelling on trains for non-essential reasons.[132] On 3 May, it was reported that Police had received 1,200 reports of people breaching alert level 3 restrictions. 686 of these reports were filed between 6 pm on 1 May and 6pm on 2 May. Police confirmed that they had taken enforcement action against 514 people for breaches of either the Health Act or the Civil Defence Emergency Act since alert level 3 came into force on midnight 28 April, prosecuting 135 and warning 342.[133] Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Scott Fraser also announced that they had to close down hundreds of parties in the past few days since the alert level 3 lockdown came into force. He warned that illegal public gatherings would \"waste all the sacrifices\" others had to make to beat COVID-19.[134] On 18 May, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster confirmed that the Police had received 250 reports of illegal mass gatherings in the four days since alert level 2 came into effect on 14 May. These included 30 reports of people holding or attending illegal parties; 29 of which resulted in a warning and one in a prosecution.[135] During an outbreak of the Delta variant in mid-August 2021, Police received 1,869 online breach notifications. Of these reports, 607 originated in Auckland, which had borne the brunt of the community outbreak. 984 of these reports were related to gatherings, 742 about a business, and 143 about individuals.[136] In late August, several Labour Party advertisements were distributed in Auckland, Christchurch, and Tauranga in breach of Alert Level 4 lockdown regulations. Labour Party general secretary Rob Salmond attributed the unauthorised distribution to party volunteers who had not followed the party's instructions not to deliver any brochures during the lockdown.[137][138] On 27 August, Police and paramedics in Queenstown attended to a wounded female mountain biker, who was part of a party of at least 50 mountain bikers at a Fernhill mountain biking park. In response, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster reminded the public that exercise under Alert Level Four should be restricted to one's neighbourhood and that any recreational activity that could lead to a rescue or emergency response was not permitted. By 27 August, 93 people had been charged with a total of 99 COVID-19-related lockdown offences since Alert Level 4 came into force on 17 August.[139] By 29 August, 103 people had been charged with a total of 111 offences nationwide since the Alert Level 4 lockdown. These cases included a woman in her 20s who was carrying a forged document claiming she was exempt from wearing masks.[140] By 31 August, Police had arrested 19 people across the country (two in the Northland Region, four in Auckland, three in Waikato, six in Bay of Plenty, two in Whanganui, one in Christchurch, and one in Taupō) for staging anti-lockdown protests in breach of Alert Level 4 restrictions.[141] On 12 September, an Auckland couple named William Willis and Hannah Rawnsley flouted Alert Level 4 lockdown restrictions by using essential worker exemptions to drive to Hamilton Airport and then fly to their holiday home in Wanaka in the South Island. The Police confirmed that the couple would be prosecuted for violating Alert Level 4 restrictions.[142] Queenstown Lakes District Mayor Jim Boult criticised the couple for endangering the health and livelihoods of local people by potentially exposing them to COVID-19.[143] The couple attracted substantial media coverage and public debate, and also received abuse on social media.[144] In mid-September, Police charged the couple with failing to comply with a COVID-19 health order.[145] On 21 December, the couple pleaded guilty to failing to abide with a COVID-19 public health order, which carries a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment or a NZ$4000 fine.[146] Judge Bruce Davidson ordered Willis to pay a NZ$750 fine and cover court costs while Rawnsley was discharged without conviction but ordered to donate NZ$500 to a charity working with vulnerable people.[147] On 14 October, an Auckland man was charged with traveling to Wanaka in breach of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.[148] That same day, two Auckland sex workers were arrested for traveling to Blenheim in the South Island without a travel exemption.[149] In mid\u2013July 2022, Auckland senior solicitor Umar Kuddus was convinced by Judge John McDonald of violating lockdown travel restrictions by making an illegal trip to Hamilton in September 2021. At the time, Kuddus did not have a work or personal exemption to travel out of Auckland. Kuddus came to the attention of his fellow lawyers and Police after he posted several social media posts boasting of his travel activities and willingness to breach lockdown restrictions in force at the time. In addition to the lockdown breach conviction, Kuddus was fined NZ$900 and ordered to pay NZ$130 in court costs.[150] A Wellington iwi placed a taupāruru (restriction) on the practice of hongi, a traditional Māori greeting, in response to the outbreak.[151] On 24 March, former Tai Tokerau Member of Parliament Hone Harawira announced that local iwi in the Far North were working with local authorities and Mayor of Far North John Carter to set up roadblocks to prevent foreign tourists from travelling into the area. Tourists in the area would be encouraged to leave the Far North. Roadblocks were set up at State Highway 1 at Whakapara and State Highway 12 at Waipoua. Harawira criticised the Government for not stopping tourists from entering the country prior to the border closure.[152] By 26 March, at least three groups of tourists had been stopped from entering the Far North. A testing centre was also set up at Waiomio Hill to test locals returning from overseas.[153] Having set up illegal road blocks to stop people from bringing the virus into the Far North, Hone Harawira broke Level 4 Lockdown restrictions to make a 600 km round trip to Auckland, then a virus hot spot, on 12 April. Harawira claimed that the purpose of the trip was to obtain medical supplies and visiting his sister was unimportant.[154] Similar measures were put in place on the East Cape area of the North Island.[155] In April, there were reports that iwi checkpoints in the central North Island, East Coast, and Northland were obstructing essential travel by local residents. National Member of Parliament for Northland Matt King said that constituents had complained about being verbally abused and spat upon at iwi checkpoints in Northland.[156][157] In response, Police Minister Stuart Nash warned that the police would take action against \"illegal\" checkpoints that had been set up without police support while allowing checkpoints in remote towns as long as they had the support of the local police and community.[156] In early May 2020, Newshub reported that the iwi Te Whānau-ā-Apanui in the eastern Bay of Plenty region had been operating an unauthorised travel permit system to protect the region's elderly population, horticulture, and agricultural industries. This included a requirement for essential workers to provide a letter from the Ministry for Primary Industries proving that their travel complied with lockdown rules, which were eased when Alert Level 4 came to an end on 28 April. On 6 May, the New Zealand Police clarified that community road block operators in the Bay of Plenty did not have the authority to turn away New Zealanders lacking the necessary travel documents.[158][159] On 26 January 2021, members of a Northland iwi including Reuben Taipari and Hone Harawira established a Tai Tokerau Border Control in response to a recent community transmission in the region.[160] The checkpoint's purpose was to educate visitors and travellers about COVID-19 including the South African strain. On 28 January, the police shut down the checkpoint on the grounds that there was no official requirement for it. In response, Harawira criticised the lack of COVID-19 testing facilities north of Whangarei over the long weekend and advocated the cancellation of the Waitangi Day public festivities scheduled for 8 February.[161] According to Ministry of Health figures released on 4 October 2021, Māori and Pacific peoples were disproportionately affected by the Delta variant outbreak in Auckland in August 2021; accounting for 97 and 103 of the 263 active cases. By contrast, Asians accounted for 23 of the active cases, the Middle Eastern, Latin American, and Africa (MELAA) community 28, and Europeans 12. Māori intellectual and researcher Dr Rawiri Taonui expressed concerns that the lifting of restrictions could affect vulnerable communities. He also said that \"marginalised groups\" such as people in gangs and transitional housing were less likely to cooperate with testing and vaccination campaigns due to their adverse experiences with schools, the justice and healthcare systems.[162] In mid November 2021, several members of the New Zealand Māori Council including Archdeacon Harvey Ruru and Tā Edward Durie filed an application for an urgent inquiry by the Waitangi Tribunal into the Government's COVID-19 response for Māori. The plaintiffs claimed that the Government's plan to move New Zealand to the \"traffic light system\" and eliminate the Auckland border in December would put Māori at risk. The claimants also took issue with the Government's 90% eligible vaccination threshold and the lack of pediatric vaccines.[163] In early December 2021, Harawira announced that the Tai Tokerau Border Control would be revived to screen travellers from Auckland heading to the Northland region following the launch of the COVID-19 \"traffic light system\" and the planned opening of the Auckland regional border on 15 December. Northland district commander Superintendent Tony Hill confirmed that joint Police and iwi checkpoints would be established at State Highway 1 in Uretiti and State Highway 12 near Maungaturoto before transitioning to random checkpoints and spot checks across the region. Police Commissioner Andrew Coster also confirmed that Police would be working with local iwi volunteers to ensure that travelers were fully vaccinated or had returned a negative COVID-19 test within the past 72 hours. The Border Control checkpoints were criticised by several political figures including ACT party leader David Seymour, former New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, former NZ First Member of Parliament Shane Jones, and National Party leader Christopher Luxon on the grounds that they restricted people's movements, economic activities, promoted division, and questioned their effectiveness.[164][165][166] In response, Labour deputy leader and Te Tai Tokerau Member of Parliament Kelvin Davis claimed that criticism of the iwi-led checkpoints was motivated by racism against Māori.[167] On 21 December, the Waitangi Tribunal ruled that the Government's vaccination rollout and \"traffic light system\" breached the Treaty of Waitangi's principles of active protection and equity. The Tribunal took particular issue with the Government's decision to prioritise those aged over 65 years and those with health conditions rather than implement a lower age threshold for Māori, who had a more youthful population and more health vulnerabilities than European New Zealanders/Pakeha. The Tribunal also ruled that the Government's transition to the \"traffic light system\" failed to take into account the lower Māori vaccination rate and health needs. The Tribunal also found that Government had not consulted adequately with Māori health providers and leaders and that efforts to address Māori needs such as the \"Māori communities Covid-19 fund\" were inadequate. The Waitangi Tribunal recommended that the Government improve data collection, improve engagement with the Māori community, and provided better support for ongoing vaccination efforts, testing, contact tracing, and support for Māori infected with Covid-19.[168][169] On 19 March 2020, the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association announced that all Anzac Day services, scheduled for 25 April, would be cancelled and the red poppy collection postponed due to the health risk. This was the first time that Anzac Day services have not been held since 1916.[170] Following a spate of community cases in Auckland in mid-February 2021, Napier's Art Deco Festival and Auckland's Gay Pride parade were cancelled. Auckland's Splore festival was postponed to 26\u201328 March 2021.[171] On 20 August 2021, a thousand people who had attended the Mitre 10 2021 Awards ceremony at Auckland's Spark Arena on 12 August were ordered to self-isolate after a bar worker later tested positive for COVID-19. Notable participants have included TVNZ broadcaster Hilary Barry.[172] From 1 September 2021, the Ministry of Health eased Level 4 restrictions to allow funeral viewings by family and whanau at a funeral home provided they were from the same bubble. Prior to that, public funerals and gatherings had not been allowed under Alert Level 4.[173] This change came as a result of lobbying from funeral directors and Pasifika community leaders who stated that the ban on funerals during lockdowns was traumatic for families.[174] On 10 November 2021, Economic and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash announced that the New Zealand Government would subsidise the costs of big events over the 2021\u20132022 summer break facing potential pandemic disruptions under its event transition support scheme. This decision was welcomed by Gibbston Valley concert general manager Dean Calvert and Rhythm and Alps festival director Alex Turnbull, who said that they felt confident to proceed with their events with the knowledge that losses caused by public health decisions could be covered.[175] The scheme has been criticised by much of the event industry for being inaccessible to most events and seen as welfare protecting the biggest businesses at the expense of the local players who will not receive support under the scheme.[citation needed] Due to concerns about community cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in January 2022, the annual Auckland Rainbow Pride Parade and the Bluff Oyster Festival were cancelled.[176][177] After the Government placed the country under \"red setting\" restrictions including limits on social gatherings on 23 January 2022, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern postponed her wedding a second time.[178] On 30 March, the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) Chief Air Marshal Kevin Short ordered military personnel not to attend public ANZAC Day commemorations to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.[179] On 8 April, Short reversed his earlier decision barring military personnel from participating in ANZAC Day events. However, he ordered military personnel to following health protection protocols including mask wearing and not participating in \"after-functions\" and \"ad-hoc groups.\"[180] On 1 June, Black Lives Matter (BLM) solidarity protests were held in several major centres including Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Tauranga, Palmerston North and Hamilton in response to the murder of George Floyd, which had sparked a wave of protests and riots in the United States and around the world. 4,000 people attended the Auckland rally alone, which saw participants marching from Aotea Square down Queen Street to the American Consulate General. In Wellington, hundreds gathered outside Parliament. According to media reports, there was little social distancing due to the large volume of participants.[181][182][183][184][185] Microbiologist and health adviser Dr. Siouxsie Wiles, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, and ACT Party leader David Seymour have criticised march participants for flouting Level 2 lockdown restrictions. Dr Wiles called for people who attended the BLM marches and gatherings to self-isolate for 14 days. Peters and Seymour criticised participants for violating Alert Level 2 lockdown restrictions and undermining efforts to eliminate COVID-19, while calling on the Government to move towards Alert Level 1.[186][187] Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has criticised protesters for violating Level 2 restrictions in the midst of a global pandemic, while expressing sympathy for George Floyd.[188][189] Police Minister Stuart Nash also indicated that New Zealand Police are not seeking to prosecute protesters while expressing disappointment that social distancing rules had been flouted.[190] Opposition Leader Todd Muller has criticised the Government for sending mixed messages about COVID-19 alert levels, alleging that they caused the public to become complacent about social distancing, citing the BLM rallies as an example.[191] In response, Christchurch BLM protest organiser Will Hunter defended his decision to hold the rally, which attracted 700 people. He also said that he and his fellow organisers had urged participants to take health precautions including wearing gloves, masks, social distancing and staying at home if sick.[192] Following a second community outbreak in Auckland in August 2020, several anti-lockdown protests were staged across several New Zealand urban centres including Auckland, Whangārei, Wellington, New Plymouth, Tauranga, Rotorua, Nelson and Christchurch.[193] Key figures and groups involved in these protests included FACTS NZ, the Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa, the Liberty March Movement, Advance New Zealand party co-leader Jami-Lee Ross, New Conservative Party deputy leader Elliot Ikilei, and New Zealand Public Party leader Billy Te Kahika.[194][195][196] Besides opposition to COVID-19 lockdown and vaccination policies, protesters also expressed opposition to 5G technology, 1080 usage, the United Nations, water fluoridation, and Communist China.[197][195][198][199] Following a third community outbreak in Auckland in August 2021, a second-wave of nationwide protests were staged in Auckland, Nelson, Tauranga, Christchurch, and Dunedin in mid-August and October 2021. Besides Te Kahika, other key figures and groups involved in the protests included far right activist Kyle Chapman, Bishop Brian Tamaki of the fundamentalist Destiny Church, the Freedom and Rights Coalition, and Dunedin city councillor Lee Vandervis.[200][201][202][203][204] In response, Police filed charges against Te Kahika and Tamaki for breaching public health orders and the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020.[200][205] On 24 March 2020, the New Zealand Government automatically extended all temporary visas with an expiry date of 2 April to 9 July 2020 inclusive who were in New Zealand on 2 April 2020 until 25 September 2020. Travellers whose visas expire before 1 April are allowed to remain if they are unable to leave the country.[206] On 13 May 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters urged migrant workers who were out of work to go home, stating that New Zealand taxpayers could not afford to support them. Peters confirmed that 50,000 migrant workers had already returned to their home countries after the New Zealand Government made arrangements with embassies to organise repatriation flights for their nationals. According to a declassified official document, there were over 383,000 foreign nationals in New Zealand including students, migrant workers, and partners or dependents of workers as of 30 March.[207][208] According to a 1 News report on 17 May 2020, there were over 1,000 Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme workers in New Zealand, mostly from the Pacific Islands. Pacific Response Coordination Team chairman Pakilau Manase Lua has stated that about 1,000 Tongan seasonal workers in NZ are facing financial difficulty due to the loss of work caused by the economic upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[209] On 3 June 2020, Radio New Zealand reported that half of the Government's $30 million emergency welfare fund had been spent over a month, with many of the recipients including stranded migrant workers and foreigners who were unable to return to their countries due to the disruption of international travel. Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act, financial assistance for food, transport, clothing and accommodation is available to anyone regardless of their citizenship. Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare has confirmed that there have been 4,500 requests for emergency assistance from the Otago region with an unknown number from the Auckland Region. Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway has stated that the \"labour market test\" will be applied on foreign workers once their work visas have expired.[210] On 7 July 2020, the Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway extended 16,500 Essential Skills and Work to Residence workers with visas by six months and extended the 12-month stand-down period for migrant workers who were going to leave in 2020 until February 2021. This stand-down period shift would benefit about 600 lower-skilled visa holders including dairy workers.[211] On 22 July 2020, Radio New Zealand reported that a six year old Korean child had been unable to attend school since his father, a temporary visa holder, was unable to return to New Zealand due to lockdown travel restrictions. Under New Zealand law, international students under the age of ten are unable to attend schools without the presence of a parent or guardian. Despite lobbying by National MP Melissa Lee on behalf of the family, Education Minister Chris Hipkins declined to intervene, citing policy issues.[212] On 20 November 2020, the Government announced that emergency benefits will be available for people on temporary work, student or visitor visas who cannot return home or support themselves from 1 December 2020. Social Development and Employment Minister Carmel Sepuloni also confirmed that emergency benefits would be available to assist people with their basic needs while they tried to return home if they could not find work.[213][214] Under the Ministry of Social Development's emergency benefits programme, eligible temporary visa holders received $251 a week for a single person and $375 a week for a solo parent. However, temporary visa holders were ineligible for extra payments available to residents including the accommodation supplement.[214] On 21 December 2020, Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi announced a six-month extension for employer-assisted work and working holiday visa holders along with their partners and children in order to address the country's labour shortage. In addition, a 12-month stand-down period for low-paid Essential Skills visa holders working in New Zealand for three years will also be suspended until January 2022.[215][216] On 16 March 2021, it was reported that the New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal had rejected a Filipino family's appeal against a deportation notice. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the father had used false addresses to claim $1,600 worth of food vouchers in order to feed his family due to their difficult financial situation.[217] In mid April 2021, the Philippines Embassy appealed to Immigration New Zealand to reconsider the deportation order and also lodged a formal complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.[218] On 24 December, the Associate Immigration Minister Phil Twyford granted the father (identified as Jeffrey Santos) a character waiver and extended the family's visas, allowing them to stay for another year in New Zealand.[219] On 10 May 2021, the Unite Union and Migrant Workers Association submitted a 15,000-strong petition calling on the Government to give residency to long-term migrant works and visa overstayers. Unite Union representative Mike Treen claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic offered New Zealand an opportunity to address long-standing problems with the country's temporary migration system.[220] On 14 May, the Federation of Aotearoa Migrants staged a protest outside of Parliament. The Federation has demanded two main objectives: residency visas for those on temporary work visas who would normally be eligible for residency, and the phased re-entry of people stuck overseas who are separated from their families. Protesters heckled the Minister of Immigration Kris Faafoi and criticised the Government's border restrictions.[221] In late August 2021, the Ministry of Social Development terminated its emergency benefits programme for migrants. This decision was criticised by New Zealand International Students' Association (NZISA) president Afiqah Ramizi and migration think tank The Fair Initiative founder Charlotte te Riet Scholten-Phillips for neglecting the socio-economic needs of international students and temporary visa holders. Afiqah stated that many students were dependent on their overseas families for financial support while Scholten-Phillips argued that migrants paid the same taxes and should be allowed benefits due to the economic hardship caused by COVID-19.[222] In addition, the Government declined to renew the NZ$1 million International Student Hardship Fund, which provided grants to education providers and other organisations to provide financial relief, food parcels, living support payments, and cash payments to international students.[223] On 30 September 2021, Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would provide a one-off simplified residency pathway known as the \"2021 resident visa\" for migrants on work visas residing in New Zealand and their families. Faafoi estimated that 165,000 migrants including health, aged care, primary industry, teachers, construction, and manufacturing workers would be eligible for the 2021 resident visa programme, which will be rolled out in two phases in December 2021 and March 2022. However, visitors, students, working holiday makers, and Recognised Seasonal Employer seasonal workers won't be eligible for the scheme.[224][225] In mid-March 2021, The New Zealand Herald reported that a COVID-19 denial group called \"Voices of Freedom\" had teamed up with the Advance New Zealand party to distribute a magazine called The Real News promoting conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines, generally repeating discredited internet-based sources.[226] The Real News is published by Full Courts Press director and shareholder Jonathan Eisen and his wife Katherine Smith, whose company has published the pseudoscientific The New Zealand Journal of Natural Medicine and the conspiracy theory\u2013promoting Uncensored magazine. By 12 March, at least 60,000 copies of the magazine had been distributed to postboxes.[227] By May 2021, Voices for Freedom and the Advance New Zealand party had raised NZ$10,000 to print and distribute 60,000 copies of The Real News.[228] In late April, a second issue of The Real News was circulated.[229] In mid-May 2021, Voices for Freedom co-founder Claire Deeks claimed that her organisation had raised NZ$50,000 towards printing two million virus \"fact flyers\" which it intended to distribute nationwide. In response, University of Otago clinical microbiologist and immunologist James Ussher criticised the flyers for spreading disinformation about the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and undermining public trust. Meanwhile, lawyer Mark von Dadelszen cautioned against donating to Voices for Freedom since it was neither a registered charity nor an incorporated society with a formal structure.[228] In mid-June 2021, Secretary for Education Iona Holsted warned that schools were being targeted by opponents of the national vaccination programme. The Ministry of Education expressed concern that school leaders were not addressing misinformation in school bulletins and that some principals were expressing opposition to vaccination. The Ministry also urged educators to use \"appropriate sources\" for verified information.[230] In August 2021, North & South magazine contributor Emanuel Stoakes reported that some local Chinese language media particularly the Chinese Herald and the website SkyKiwi were promoting disinformation about the effectiveness of Western COVID-19 vaccines in comparison to Chinese vaccines. East Auckland doctor David Wu identified the Chinese social media platform WeChat as key source of vaccine misinformation and pro-Beijing propaganda among the Chinese community in New Zealand. Political scientist Anne-Marie Brady urged the New Zealand Government to monitor Chinese language channels and provide Chinese-speaking New Zealanders with greater access to COVID-19 information in their own language to combat disinformation.[231] In mid-September 2021, Dunedin City councillor Lee Vandervis attracted media and public attention and after he published several COVID-19\u2013related social media posts questioning the effectiveness of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and advocating the use of the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin for treating COVID-19.[232] In late October 2021, several Jewish New Zealander leaders including Holocaust Centre of NZ chair Deborah Hart, NZ Jewish Council spokesperson Juliet Moses, and Zionist Federation of New Zealand leader Rob Berg criticised anti-vaccination advocates including Billy Te Kahika for likening the Government's lockdown and vaccination mandate policies to the Nazi Holocaust and persecution of Jews.[233] Several Jewish community figures including Hart and Holocaust survivor Sami Cohen have criticised anti-vaccination advocates for re-appropriating the yellow Star of David and likening the Government's COVID-19 mitigation and vaccination policies to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.[234][235] In early November 2021, the University of Auckland's Te Pūnaha Matatini's Disinformation Project released a working paper examining COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation since the Delta outbreak began in 17 August 2021. The paper found that far right online communities in New Zealand and abroad were using various social media platforms including Telegram to spread disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and lockdown policies through the use of memes, emotional testimonies, and Māori motifs and symbols. The paper also argue that anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine elements were reappropriating Māori motifs and symbols such as the hikoi and United Tribes of New Zealand flag to exploit racial tensions. The paper argued that far right elements were using COVID-19 and vaccination as a Trojan horse for promoting far right ideologies in New Zealand on a range of issues including gun control, anti-Māori sentiment, homophobia, transphobia, conservative family values and structures, misogyny, and immigration.[236][237][238] In response to the Auckland February community outbreak in late February 2021, Left-wing blogger Martyn \"Bomber\" Bradbury has advocated that the Government declare an amnesty for overstayers and provide compensation payments to people unable to work from home in order to help the Pasifika communities in South Auckland.[239] By 24 August 2021, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield confirmed that Pasifika had accounted for over 50 percent of cases in the country's Delta variant outbreak that had begun on 17 August. In response, Pacific Response Coordination Team chair Pakilau Manase Lua called for more community-led organisations such as churches to lead their own vaccination rates. Pasifika have the highest levels of testing in New Zealand but have the lowest vaccination rate within the population.[98] That same day 58 cases had been linked to the Samoan Assemblies of God church in Māngere, whose congregants received racist abuse. Auckland councillor Efeso Collins claimed there was a racist double standard against Pasifika while the Ministry of Health condemned racism against the Pasifika community.[99] On 28 August 2021, South Seas Healthcare's youth hub Bubblegum mobilised 50 Pasifika youths in Auckland to aid in frontline work including the distribution of food boxes to families in the Samoan Assemblies of God church cluster, connecting with their peers, helping the elderly to get vaccinated, and provide the 0800 Pasifika vaccination helpline with second language options.[240] The opposition ACT and National parties have called for the Government to abandon its lockdown and elimination policies. In late September 2021, ACT party leader David Seymour released his party's COVID 3.0 strategy, which advocated a \"harm minimisation\" strategy in place of an elimination strategy. Seymour also advocated the abandonment of lockdown policies in favour of isolating infected individuals and easing border restrictions for travelers from low risk countries.[241] On 29 September, National Party leader Judith Collins released the party's three pillars plan which included a ten-step plan for boosting New Zealand's response to COVID-19, setting a 70-75% vaccination target for ending lockdowns, and an 85-90 percent target for ending border restrictions. Collins also called for an abandonment of the Government's elimination strategy and criticised the state of the country's managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system.[242] On 11 October 2021, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters criticised the Government for failing to prevent a COVID-19 breach in the Northland Region involving a sex worker, which had led to the reinstatement of Alert Level 3 lockdown restrictions in the region.[243] On 11 October, the Māori Party objected to the Government's efforts to lift COVID-19 lockdown restrictions due to lower vaccination rates among Māori in comparison to other ethnic groups. The Māori Party also opposed the Government's plan to reopen the borders once 90% of the population had been vaccinated, claiming that it would amount to \"modern-day genocide.\"[244] In mid\u2013November, ACT New Zealand leader David Seymour advocated for a regular testing regime for unvaccinated workers in place of the Government's vaccine mandate for education, health and hospitality workers.[245] In early December 2021, National Party leader Christopher Luxon called for the immediate lifting of Auckland's border restrictions with Northland after The New Zealand Herald reported that the Ministry of Health had proposed that the Auckland border should be lifted in tandem with the country's transition into the \"traffic light system\" on 3 December. However, Prime Minister Ardern and COVID-19 Response Minister Hipkins had opted to retain Auckland's border until 15 December to minimise the risk of community transmissions and boost regional vaccination rates.[246][247] In early February 2021, Luxon advocated that rapid antigen testing be conducted in schools twice a week for both students and teachers, following the example of New South Wales and Victoria. There are approximately over 800,000 students and 70,000 teachers scattered over 2,000 schools in New Zealand. In addition, Luxon advocated reopening New Zealand's borders and ending the managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system in favour of home isolation on a staggered basis for New Zealanders and travellers who tested negative for COVID-19.[248] That same day, Māori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer called for the Health Ministry to improve its daily COVID-19 updates, citing a delay in the reportage of Omicron cases in Hāwera.[249] In mid March 2022, Luxon and the National Party's COVID-19 Response Spokesperson Chris Bishop called for the Government to scrap the COVID-19 Protection Framework, pre-departure testing, My Vaccine Pass checks except for large indoor events, requirements for NZ COVID Tracer app QR code scanning, and the elimination of vaccine mandates for persons under the age of 18 years. The National Party also called for the COVID-19 isolation period to be reduced to five days. Luxon claimed that QR code scanning and vaccine pass requirements did not make sense while Bishop said that the vaccine pass requirements prevented unvaccinated people from participating in community activities including sports.[250][251] Following the implementation of stronger border controls, SANZAAR announced on 14 March 2020 that it would suspend play of its Super Rugby season (which features five New Zealand teams) following the conclusion of that weekend's matches.[252] On 15 March, it was announced that the Warbirds Over Wanaka 2020 airshow was cancelled due to the Government's response to the pandemic.[253] On 15 February 2021, the Halberg Awards celebrating New Zealand sports champions from the past decade was postponed due to Auckland shifting to Alert Level 3 as a result of three community transmissions detected in Papatoetoe the previous day.[254] On 23 June 2021, Wellington's Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa has closed for two days for deep cleaning after an Australian tourist who visited the museum and its Surrealist Arts Masterpieces exhibit tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. In addition, 2,500 people who visited Te Papa Museum at the same time as the tourist were asked to go into self-isolation for between five and 14 days, depending on the part of the Museum they were visiting.[255][15] On 29 August 2021, the Government relaxed Alert Level 4 restrictions to allow whitebaiting and fishing. Prior to that, only Māori customary fishing rights were permitted under Level 4.[256] In February 2021 the Chinese consulate in Auckland was affected by a phony bomb threat made by individuals on an events website Aucklife that they had hacked, where they also made similar threats against the Chinese consulate in Sydney, Australia. Their motive was reportedly a punitive response against China for allegedly causing the pandemic. As a result, a physical search was conducted at the consulate by New Zealand's Police Specialist Search Group while Aucklife owner Hailey Newton had since regained her access to the website.[257] Following the Delta community outbreak in mid\u2013August 2021, the Police were criticised by Northland Māori iwi and leaders including former politician Hone Harawira for not immediately erecting fixed checkpoints between Northland and Auckland after the country moved into an Alert Level 4 lockdown. The Level 4 announcement on 17 August had triggered an influx of people and vehicles from Auckland into the Northland region.[258] Other Northland residents criticised inconsistencies in the location of Police checkpoints near the Brynderwyn Hills, Kaiwaka and Mangawhai which inhibited travel by residents to access essential services like groceries.
