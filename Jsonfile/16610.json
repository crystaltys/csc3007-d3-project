He moved to Donetsk at an early age. In 1993 he entered the Black Sea Higher Naval Institute of Nakhimov, and transferred to the Sevastopol National Technical University, faculty of finances. From 2006 to 2008 Semenchenko studied to become a film director.[8][9] He has three sons \u2013 Hryhoriy, Mykhailo, and Artem.[7] According to Semenchenko, he and the other members of the Donbas Battalion gained combat experience in the Ukrainian army or Soviet Army.[8] He said he worked in \"business activities in the field of security\" before the war in Donbass.[5] Semenchenko, the founder of the Donbas Battalion, said in May 2014: \"Our state needs defending, and we decided that if the army could not do it, we should do it ourselves.\"[5][8] On 19 August 2014, Semenchenko was wounded by shrapnel when his forces were hit by mortar fire before entering the town of Ilovaysk, 18 kilometers east of Donetsk. He underwent an emergency surgery and recovered slowly. He was later awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky by the Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov.[10] During 2014 he was always photographed wearing a balaklava. Removing it on 1 September 2014, he stated, \"I was never afraid, I was worried about my family; they are now safe and I'm not afraid.\"[11][12] Semenchenko made his entry into national politics prior to the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election. Appearing second on the party list of Samopomich, he was elected to the Verkhovna Rada.[13][14] On February 9, 2015 by the Decree of the President of Ukraine Semen Semenchenko delegated his powers as a commander of the Donbas battalion to Anatolyi Vynogrodskiy though being a founder of the battalion Semenchenko remained its honoured commander.[15] Semenchenko was the Samopomich candidate in the 27 March 2016 early mayoral election in Kryvyi Rih. With 10.92% of the vote he lost this election to Yuriy Vilkul (who won the re-election with 74.18%.[16] Semenchenko did not take part in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, he said his experience and organizational skills would be more useful for Ukraine outside parliament than the \u201cguerrilla war\u201d of an opposition deputy.[6] Semen Semenchenko took part in the 2004 Orange Revolution and 2013\u20132014 Euromaidan popular uprisings. In 2014 during the parliamentary elections the battalion commander Semenchenko decided to run for the elections as a member of the party of a Lviv politician, Mayor of the city Andriy Sadovyi - Self-Reliance Union.[17][18][19] On September 12, 2014 a list of candidates was made public and the commander of the battalion was number 2, while Аndriy Sadovyi was number 50. In Espreso.TV studio he explained his reasons to go into a big-league politics: There are things to be done right now before the elections to the Parliament. First of all, it is a situation with wounded, captured and deceased. The most common situation for the people being captured is no chance to be released quickly. There is a very long chain of agreeing. I think according to Minsk agreements these people should be already free. We will create civil pressure without shouting, rallies but together with the mothers and wives of the captured soldiers to get a report on what is going on.[20] One of the issues of Semenchenko program is building of the Ukrainian military organization created by him which mobilizes the society to encourage a process of forming a unified system of the territorial defence in Ukraine. According to Semenchenko: This is a system of training, selecting motivated people. Mothers and wives won\u2019t follow them shouting: Give our children back. These are older people who have already decided themselves and are motivated to protect their Motherland. A lot of them can\u2019t join battalions, the army. They will join the territorial defense forces in their area.[20] His vision of the future Ukraine as a final aim of his political activity Semenchenko expressed like this: Our dream Ukraine is a strong independent state where the law allowing people to reach results relatively to their abilities without any family connections or protection will be in force. The war will be over when the country becomes strong and the society becomes just.[21] At the beginning of June Semen Semenchenko together with veterans of the Donbas battalion inspected checkpoints to the Crimea and from the Crimea. At each such checkpoint they found about 500 trucks a day carrying different stuff: Trucks owners do not pay anything to the Budget and those people who patronize this are becoming rich as it is not possible to do if you don\u2019t have a patron on a high level. For example, petrol smuggling during Yanukovych presidency was patronized by his son, but who is doing this now is not known though it should be on the level of the Presidential Administration.[22] Being a member of the Self-Reliance Union Semen Semenchenko is a Deputy Head of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Security and Defence.[23] In June 2014 Semen Semenchenko together with soldiers of the Donbas battalion went to the Presidential Administration to protest against an introduction of a cease-fire regime with separatists and martial law[24][25][26] In 2015 Semenchenko together with the Donbas battalion requested near Shyrokyno to cancel demilitarization.[27] Semen Semenchenko claimed the necessity and availability of the alternatives to Minsk agreements. Later he was a co-author of a law which was an alternative to Minsk Agreements[28] On August 21, 2014 by the decree of the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, Semenchenko was awarded the Bohdan Khmelnytsky Order, Third class for \"personal courage and heroism shown during protection of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, dedication to loyalty oath, highly professional execution of his duty\".[29][30] He was awarded for the service in the battle shown while liberating the cities of Artemivsk, Popasna and Lysychansk.

They discussed how the USA can help to create the territorial defence of Ukraine.[40] On November 12, 2014 Semen Semenchenko, Andriy Teteruk and Yuriy Bereza had a meeting with the Head of Department of Consular Support of Ukraine - Poliova Alla Valentynivna in Frankfurt (Germany). During the meeting they discussed the issue of volunteers\u2019 help to ATO participants and shared their ideas about possible perspectives of cooperation. Semen Semenchenko also touched the urgent topic of providing those who suffered during the ATO in Ukraine with quality prostheses.[41] Semen Semenchenko went to the US to pay a visit to military training centres to talk about training.[42] On November 13, 2014 Semen Semenchenko with a delegation came to the US to discuss provision of the military aid to Ukraine with congressmen.[43] In the middle of February 2015 Semen Semenchenko initiated a creation of his personalized charitable organization Charitable Fund of Semen Semenchenko. The main activities of the fund are resettlement of volunteer soldiers, providing assistance to them in treatment and rehabilitation, providing assistance to the soldiers and their families who are in poor financial conditions. On February 18 in Dripropetrovsk being already a member of the parliament, an ex-commander of the Donbas battalion Semen Semenchenko, deputy commander of the Volunteer Ukrainian Corps Valentyn Manko and a supervisor of the Kryvbas battalion Mykola Kolesnyk said they were to set the General Staff of volunteer battalions as a coordination centre to exchange intelligence data which will provide information to the President of Ukraine. The Staff was headed by seven commanders including Semenchenko and a leader of Right Sector (Pravyi Sektor) Dmytro Yarosh.[44][45][46] Semen Semenchenko is a civil activist in providing legal rights and interests of volunteers, namely his activity is aimed at preventing illegal prosecution of volunteers, taking soldiers of volunteer battalions on bail and visiting courts to provide support and protection for soldiers.[47][48][49] Semen Semenchenko took part in protests to protect a founder and soldier of the Aydar battalion Valentyn Lykholit (code name Batia). Thanks to active actions Kyiv Court of Appeal let Valentyn Lykholit out on bail of the Verkhovna Rada deputies Semen Semenchenko and others.[50][51] Semen Semenchenko was also present and provided support and protection of interests of NABU (the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine) in Solomianskyi Court of Kyiv where NABU accused a military prosecutor of the ATO area Kostiantyn Kulyk of illegal getting rich.[52] In January 2015 Semen Semenchenko together with Yehor Soboliev and others accused a judge of Kharkiv District Administrative Court of delivering a judgment which doesn't express the will of people. Threats of Yehor Soboliev (judges will be thrown out of the windows) and Semen Semenchenko became a subject of an open letter of the Judges Council of Ukraine about threatening their health and lives. Soon the claimant refused of the lawsuit because it was dangerous for the judges that's why the judgment of the first instance court was not evaluated by the appeal court.[53] Semen Semenchenko in his turn expressed his views on the situation: It is necessary for a law to be in force. If there is a law on \u2018Сivil Servants Screening\u2019 judges could not substitute the will of people by their judgments. If they substitute, they will be punished. If we have neither anticorruption bureau, nor practice of punishing judges and prosecutors, we will use creative methods: encouragingly, legally, by a good word and a dumpster if necessary.[54] In mid-April 2014 Semenchenko formed a detachment of citizen militia out of Ukrainian citizens in the Donetsk region to struggle against separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). He suggested calling it the Donbas Battalion. However, the leadership of the Donetsk Regional State Administration did not support Semenchenko's initiative, resulting in the activists moving to the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. With support from the region's leadership, they managed to form its detachment as a company of the Donbas Battalion.[55][56] According to Semenchenko, \u2018We faced a serious counteraction in our region. The Governor did nothing though he had agreed to. We managed to form a battalion only in the neighbouring region\u2019.[57] Semen Semenchenko in his interviews repeatedly highlighted that the Donbas Battalion was formed thanks to volunteers\u2019 and activists\u2019 donations. The battalion received no funding from Kolomoyskyi.[58] According to Semenchenko, he and his companions received their first military weapon having attacked a terrorist-controlled checkpoint and being equipped with traumatic weapon on May 1. Further on, till the battalion was including into the National Guard, the battalion was deployed with small arms, grenades RGD and sniper rifles. Dnipropetrovsk Regional State Administration supported the Donbas battalion commander Semen Semenchenko when he asked their assistance. Borys Filatov, a deputy governor of the Dnipropetrovsk Region told to Obozrevatel. \u2018Semen came to us and said Hello and we supported him\u2019 \u2013 he said. \u2018I remember the time when he had only 60 persons without uniform, boots and ammunition and their first weapons they got coming to checkpoints at night\u2019 \u2013 continued the deputy head of the Regional State Administration.[59] On May 15, 2014 Semenchenko leading the battalion liberated the district department of militia in Velyka Novosilka from loyal to terrorists militia.[60] Then a head of the district department was changed and the personnel swore an oath to be loyal to Ukraine one more time. Above the District Department Building a Ukrainian flag was raised.[61] Soon at about 9 pm they were informed about 30 vehicles of separatists from so called Vostok battalion moving in the direction of Velyka Novosilka though a real battle did not take place. After a short firefighting having several men lightly wounded Vostok retreated. On May 22, 2014 the battalion took control over the administration building of Vlodarsky district the DNR flag was removed from the building and replaced by the flag of Ukraine.[62] On the morning May 23, 2014 the battalion fell into an ambush of Russian terrorists in the village of Karlivka Mariyinsky district.[63] Part of militaries managed to escape the entrapment and reach a checkpoint of the Ukrainian militaries close to the town of Krasnoarmiysk. 5 people were killed.
