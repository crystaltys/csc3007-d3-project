After the defeat of President Mahinda Rajapaksa on 8 January 2015, Sri Lankan authorities reopened the case due to new evidence, and currently investigating it as a murder. Several news outlets have alleged that Yoshitha Rajapaksa is the mastermind behind the murder because of rivalry and jealousy over a former girlfriend.[30][31][32] However, the former president Rajapaksa denied murder allegations against his son, claiming that the investigation is politically motivated.[citation needed] He was arrested under Section 32 of the Penal Code and was remanded in January 2016 by Kaduwela Magistrate Dhammika Hemapala over the alleged financial irregularities at the CSN, where he was unable to prove the funds use to run the TV station and misuse of public funds.[33][34] Yoshitha is accused of money laundering to the tune of Rs. 365 million, criminal breach of trust, forgery and undervaluing imported items obtained by CSN. FCID detectives said that they had seized Rs. 165 million from the CSN bank account which not been accounted and the alleged funds for setting up the television channel are believed to be from illegal foreign sources.[35] In October 2020, Rajapaksa was appointed Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, his father Mahinda Rajapaksa. The post was previously held by Sagala Ratnayaka, a Cabinet Minister and member of parliament. The Prime Minister's Office had clarified that the Rajapaksa's position is similar to that of an Additional Secretary.[36] As part of the ongoing 2022 protests against the Sri Lankan government due to the economic crisis facing the country it was reported in the local press that he left Sri Lanka on 9 May 2022 with his family.[37] Yoshitha Rajapakse married Nitheesha Jayasekera, daughter of businessman Ananda Jayasekara on 3 October 2019 and the wedding was held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.[38]","Title":"Yoshitha Rajapaksa - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12844","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitha_Rajapaksa"}
