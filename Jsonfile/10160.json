A conditional knockout mouse line, called Ifitm3tm1Masu[15][16] was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program \u2014 a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists \u2014 at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.[17][18][19] Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion.[13][20] Twenty four tests were carried out on mutant mice, but no significant abnormalities were observed.[13] However, challenge with influenza A virus indicated that these mice display increased viral susceptibility.[9]","Title":"IFITM3 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10160","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFITM3"}
