{"Content: ":"The Battle of Meretun (or Merton) between a West Saxon army led by King Ã†thelred and his brother, the future King Alfred the Great, and a Danish army took place on 22 March 871 at an unknown location in Wessex, probably in one of the modern counties of Dorset, Hampshire, or Wiltshire. According to the manuscript C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: The battle is dated by the death of Heahmund, Bishop of Sherborne. His feast day is listed in the English calendar of saints as 22 March, indicating that he died on that date.[2] Various names and spellings similar to Marton or Meretun have been used for the site of the engagement.[2] The location is unknown, but there are two possibilities based on the location names used in the original text sources. One is in the vicinity of ancient Merdon Castle, which is in Hursley parish near Winchester.[3] The other is the village of Marten in Wiltshire,[4] although there is a similarly named village called Marden, also in Wiltshire.[5] ","Title":"Battle of Meretun - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2655","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Meretun"}
