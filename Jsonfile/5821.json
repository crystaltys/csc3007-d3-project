{"Content: ":"Carillons, musical instruments of bells in the percussion family, are found throughout the United States. Several institutions register and count them. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments which serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace.[1] TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics.[2] As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.[3][4] According to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation, there are about 170 existing traditional carillons in the United States. The carillons in the United States, in Belgium, and in the Netherlands account for two-thirds of the world's total.[5] ","Title":"List of carillons in the United States - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5821","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_carillons_in_the_United_States"}
