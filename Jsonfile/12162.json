{"Content: ":"This is a list of known dolphinariums worldwide. Many of these places are more than just dolphinariums; the list includes themeparks, marine mammal parks, zoos or aquariums that may also have more than one species of dolphin. The current status of parks marked with an asterisk (*) is unknown; these parks may have closed down, moved, changed names or no longer house any dolphins. Due to the large number of facilities worldwide, this list may not be complete. Facilities only housing porpoises are not listed. Though Egypt, Russia and Turkey are transcontinental countries, for the sake of keeping information together they have been listed under Africa and Europe and Asia respectively.","Title":"List of dolphinariums - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12162","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dolphinariums"}
