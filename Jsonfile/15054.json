{"Content: ":"Opposition (27) The National Assembly (Portuguese: Assembleia Nacional) is the unicameral legislative body of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe. The Assembly is elected for a four-year term. The Assembly can be dissolved by the President of the Republic in case of a serious institutional crisis,[3] only with the approval of the Council of State, a consultative assembly composed of 12 members.[4] The National Assembly was founded in 1975, as a result of the adoption of the Constitution of São Tomé and Príncipe. From 1975 to 1990, the Assembly served as a rubber-stamp to the one-party regime led by the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe. With the constitutional reforms of 1990, the country became a multi-party democracy and the first competitive elections were organised in 1991. * The Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party was a member of the Uê Kédadji coalition in the 2002 election.
