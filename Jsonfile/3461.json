The camouflage researcher Isla Forsyth describes this work as an \"extensive study into modern military camouflage..by the British and US military throughout the First and Second World Wars, exploring the contribution of art and science, and the ways in which, via modern and contemporary art, camouflage has been appropriated by contemporary culture\".[10] Mike Leggett, reviewing the book in Leonardo, wrote that \"the outcome of enthusiastic research it is, but an entertaining summary of the field it also manages to be.\"[11] Michael Martone calls Behrens \"a wonderful writer and artist ... whose work on camouflage and art is important to me. He publishes an amazing 'zine called Ballast on visual and verbal punning.\"[12] Behrens is married to the artist Mary Snyder Behrens,[13] with whom he is founder and co-proprietor of Bobolink Books.[3]","Title":"Roy Behrens - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3461","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Behrens"}
