{"Content: ":"George McDonald Church (born 28 August 1954) is an American geneticist, molecular engineer, and chemist. He is the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT, and a founding member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.[2][3][7] As of March 2017[update], Church serves as a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Board of Sponsors.[8] George McDonald Church was born on 28 August 1954 on MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Florida, and grew up in nearby Clearwater;[2][9][10][11] he attended high school at the preparatory boarding school Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, from 1968 to 1972.[12] He then studied at Duke University, completing a bachelor's degree in zoology and chemistry in two years.[2] In the fall of 1973, Church began research work at Duke University with assistant professor of biochemistry Sung-Hou Kim, work that continued a year later with Church in a graduate biochemistry program at Duke on an NSF fellowship.[10][13] As Peter Miller reported for the National Geographic series, \"The Innovators\": \"As a graduate student at Duke\u2026 he used x-ray crystallography to study the three-dimensional structure of \"transfer\" RNA, which decodes DNA and carries instructions to other parts of the cell. It was groundbreaking research, but Church spent so much time in the lab\u2014up to a hundred hours a week\u2014that he neglected his other classes [in the fall of 1975]\".[13] As a result, Church was not compliant with Duke graduate academic policies, and was withdrawn from the degree program in January 1976. He was told that \"[We] hope that whatever problems\u2026 contributed to your lack of success\u2026 at Duke will not keep you from a successful pursuit of a productive career.\"[13][14] The work gave rise to publications that include a Proceedings report with Church as lead author on an early model for molecular interactions between the minor groove of double-stranded DNA and Î²-ribbons of proteins.[15][16] Church returned to graduate work at Harvard University in 1977 under Walter Gilbert,[17] and completed a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology working on mobile genetic elements within introns of yeast mitochondrial and mouse immunoglobulin genes (1984).[4] After completing his doctoral work, Church spent six months of 1984 at Biogen, the industrial laboratory site where Prof. Gilbert had relocated a sizable part of his former Harvard group;[2] this was followed soon after by a Life Sciences Research Foundation postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco with Gail R. Martin,[18][19] a member of the National Academy of Sciences and joint-discoverer of a technique to extract mouse embryonic stem cells.[20][21] Church joined the Harvard Medical School faculty as an assistant professor in 1986.[2] Church is now the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School,[22] and a member of the Harvard-MIT health sciences and technology faculty. He was also a founding member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.[2] Church has also served as director of the Center on Bioenergy Technology at Harvard, funded by a multiyear award from the U.S. Department of Energy.[when?][citation needed] and of the Center of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) at Harvard, funded by a P50-type award from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a part of the National Institutes of Health.[23] He co-founded Veritas Genetics and its European and Latin American subsidiary, Veritas Intercontinental, with the idea of bringing the benefits of genomic data to millions of people globally. Church was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2012 for contributions to human genome sequencing technologies and DNA synthesis and assembly. In 2018, Church co-founded Nebula Genomics, a personal genomics company that offers a whole-genome sequencing service.[24] The company says that it is developing its own blockchain, with the purpose to improve privacy and security while also giving the possibility to people to have free sequencing in exchange of their genomic and personal data but, despite that, re-identification of people starting from the genetic data could still be possible (DNA itself is a unique identifier), law enforcement could still issue search warrants or subpoena the data and this technology, given also the fact that is hard to implement, could still be vulnerable to data breaches.[25][26][27] In 2021, Church joined as a co-founder of HLTH.network (formerly Shivom),[28] a healthcare blockchain startup which created the world's first global omics data sharing & analytics marketplace. The HLTH.network aims to be the \"world's first base layer protocol for global health data\"[29] Since 2007, George Church has served on the, Chinese life sciences company, BGI Group's scientific advisory board. In 2017, BGI established the George Church Institute of Regenesis, a research collaboration between Church's lab and about a dozen staffers at BGI in China. On 18 February 2020, Nebula Genomics has also announced that has partnered up with BGI: the salive samples sent for decoding to Nebula Genomics are then sent by the company to BGI labs in Hong Kong for sequencing.[30] Nebula Genomics said that this partnership is made to bring down the cost of whole-genome sequencing (they offer 30x whole-genome sequencing for $299), since normally it has a cost that makes it inaccessible to most people.[31] Church is known for his professional contributions in the sequencing of genomes and interpreting such data, in synthetic biology and genome engineering, and in an emerging area of neuroscience that proposes to map brain activity and establish a \"functional connectome.\" Among these, Church is known for pioneering the specialized fields of personal genomics and synthetic biology. He has co-founded commercial concerns spanning these areas, and others from green and natural products chemistry to infectious agent testing and fuel production, including Knome, LS9, and Joule Unlimited (respectively, human genomics, green chemistry, and solar fuel companies). With Walter Gilbert, Church published the first direct genomic sequencing method in 1984.[32][33] Described in that publication were the cyclic application of fluids to a solid phase alternating with imaging, plus avoidance of bacterial cloning, strategies that are still used in current dominant Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. These technologies began to affect genome-scale sequencing in 2005.[34] Church also helped initiate the Human Genome Project in 1984[35] He invented the broadly applied concepts of molecular multiplexing and barcode tags.[36] and his genome was the fifth whole human genome ever sequenced (and it is planned to be the first genomic NFT). Church was also the first person to make his medical records and genome publicly available to researchers.[37] Technology transfer from his Harvard laboratory of automated sequencing and software to Genome Therapeutics Corp. resulted in the first bacterial genome sequence and first commercial genome (the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori) in 1994.[38] Church was also co-inventor of nanopore sequencing in 1995,[citation needed] which are now commercially available (e.g. Oxford Nanopore Technologies),[citation needed] but not in the form embodied in Church's contribution to the original patents.[39] To aid in the interpretation and sharing of genomes, Church, in 2005, initiated the Personal Genome Project (PGP),[40] which provides the world's only open-access human genome and trait data sets.[41][42][43] Eight trios (mother, father, and child) from the Personal Genome Project are in the process of being chosen to act as the primary genome standards (Reference Materials) for the NIST+FDA genomeinabottle.org program.[44] He has co-developed \"genome engineering\" technologies since 1997 via either general homologous recombination (recA and lambda-red)[45] or via sequence-specific nucleases.[46] Since 2004, his team has developed use of DNA array (aka DNA chip) synthesizers for combinatorial libraries and assembling large genome segments.[47] He co-developed Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) and optimized CRISPR/Cas9 discovered by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for engineering a variety of genomes ranging from yeast to human.[46] His laboratory's use of CRISPR in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) is the latest contender for precise gene therapy.[48] His team is the first to tackle a genome-scale change in the genetic code.[49] This was done in a 4.7 million basepair genome of an industrially useful microbe (E. coli) with the goal of making a safer and more productive strain; this strain uses non-proteinogenic amino acids in proteins and is metabolically and genetically isolated from other species. He has co-invented several uses for DNA, including detectors for dark matter \u2013 Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs),[50] anti-cancer \"nano-robots\",[51] and strategies for digital data storage that are over a million times denser than conventional disk drives.[52] Together with polymerase, DNA can be used to sense and store variation in photons, nucleotides, or ions.[53] He was part of a team of six[53] who, in a 2012 scientific commentary, proposed a Brain Activity Map, later named BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies).[54] They outlined specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a \"functional connectome\", as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project,[53] including wireless, minimally invasive methods to detect and manipulate neuronal activity, either utilizing microelectronics or synthetic biology. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a \"ticker tape record\" of neuronal activity.[53][55] In March 2015, Church and his genetics research team at Harvard successfully copied some woolly mammoth genes into the genome of an Asian elephant. Using the CRISPR DNA editing technique, his group spliced genetic segments from frozen mammoth specimens, including genes from the ears, subcutaneous fat, and hair attributes, into the DNA of skin cells from a modern elephant. This marked the first time that woolly mammoth genes had been functionally active since the species became extinct.[56] Their work has not been subject to peer review, however. Church stated that \"Just making a DNA change isn't that meaningful. We want to read out the phenotypes.\" To do that, the team plans to perform further tests to get the hybrid cells into becoming specialized tissues, and from there attempting to turn the hybrid elephant/mammoth skin cells into hybrid embryos that can be grown in artificial wombs.[citation needed] On September 13, 2021, Church founded a biosciences and genetics company, Colossal Biosciences, with entrepreneur Ben Lamm. The company is attempting to use genetic code to revive the woolly mammoth by equipping Asian elephants with mammoth traits.[57][58] Church has co-founded 22[59] companies, including Veritas Genetics (human genomics, 2014, with Mirza Cifric, Preston Estep, Yining Zhao, Joe Thakuria), Warp Drive Bio (natural products, 2011, with Greg Verdine and James Wells), Alacris (cancer systems therapeutics, 2010, with Hans Lehrach, Bernhard Herrmann, and Shahid Imran), Knome (human genomics, 2007, with Jorge Conde and Sundar Subramaniam),[60] Pathogenica (microbe and viral NGS diagnostics, 2009, with Yemi Adesokan),[61] AbVitro (immunomes, 2010, with Francois Vigneault),[62] Gen9 Bio (synthetic biology, 2009, with Joseph Jacobson and Drew Endy), EnEvolv (Genome Engineering), Joule Unlimited (SolarFuels, 2007, with Noubar Afeyan and David Berry), LS9 (green chemistry, 2005, with Chris Somerville, Jay Keasling, Vinod Khosla, Noubar Afeyan, and David Berry),[63][64][65] and ReadCoor (spatial biology, 2016, with Richard Terry and Evan R. Daugharthy).[66] He has participated in technology development, licensing patents and advising most of the Next-Generation Sequencing companies, including Complete Genomics, Life Technologies, Illumina, Danaher Corporation, Roche Diagnostics, Pacific Biosciences, Genia, and Nabsys.[65] He was on the Scientific Advisory Board of Cambrian Genomics[67] He is one of the co-founders of Genome Project-Write. Church spearheaded the concept and implementation of open access sequencing hardware[68] and shareable human medical data.[43] He has noted the potential for re-identification of human research participants and the tendency for consent forms to be opaque \u2013 proposing an alternative \"open consent\" mechanism.[41][42] He has participated in the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues,[69] cautioning about the risk of synthetic DNA and proposing risk-reduction via licensing and surveillance.[70][71] His laboratory has a major bio-safety engineering focus.[49] He has been an early advocate of online, open education since 2002.[citation needed] He is advisor to the Personal Genetics Education Project[72] and has spent a day teaching at The Jemicy School.[73] He has championed citizen science, especially in the fields of synthetic biology and personal genomics.[42] Since 2008, his team has been hosting an annual Genomes, Environments and Traits (GET) Conference with free online videos.[74] Church is a member of the Rapid Deployment Vaccine Collaborative (RaDVaC), a group formed early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to create an easily produced, free and open-source vaccine for self-administration.[75] Church was partly funded from 2005 to 2007 by the nonprofit Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, a private foundation established by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The affiliation was listed as for cutting-edge science and education.[76] In his 2019 apology for \"poor awareness\" of Epstein's sex offender status, Church said he had \"nerd tunnel vision\" and articles on Epstein's crimes were unclear to him, placing responsibility on vetting donors on the development office.[77] Church faced criticism for his response to a question from Der Spiegel where he speculated that it could be technically possible to make a Neanderthal by reconstructing its DNA and modifying living human cells accordingly.[78] Church pointed out that he was not working on such a project.[79][80] In his science and popular efforts, Church has also promoted open access genome sequencing and shareable human medical data, as well as online, open education and citizen science. Church authored the 2012 NewScientist \"top science book,\" Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves with Ed Regis.[81][82] He has participated in news interviews and videos including at TED, TEDx,[83][84][85] and TEDMED venues, at PBS's Charlie Rose,[86] Faces of America, and NOVA, as well as at PopSci, EG, and The Colbert Report.[87][88] He is a regular contributor to Edge.org publications and videos[89] and is a member of the Xconomists, an ad hoc team of editorial advisors for the tech news and media company, Xconomy.[90] Church has received accolades including election to the National Academy of Sciences (in 2011),[2][91] and the National Academy of Engineering (in 2012).[92] He received the American Society for Microbiology Promega Biotechnology Research Award and the heptannual Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science of the Franklin Institute.[93] He authored the NewScientist \"top science book,\" Regenesis (on synthetic biology) with Ed Regis. Other honors include the Triennial International Steven Hoogendijk Award in 2010 and the Scientific American Top 50 twice (for \"Designing artificial life\" in 2005 and \"The $1000 genome\" in 2006).[94][95] Newsweek picked Church for their 2008 \"Power of Ideas\" recognition in the category of Medicine (for the Personal Genome Project).[96] In September 2010, Dr Church was honored for his work in genetics with the Mass High Tech All-Star Award.[97] He is a member of the Research Advisory Board of SENS Research Foundation.[98] Church is married to fellow Harvard Medical School faculty member in genetics Ting Wu.[99] Church has been outspoken in his support of following a vegan lifestyle, for reasons concerned with health, and with environmental and moral issues. When asked about his dietary choice, Church replied, \"I've been vegan off-and-on since 1974 when I was inspired by participating in an MIT nutritional study, and quite strictly since 2004.\" He goes on to elaborate 4 reasons: \"medical (cholesterol in fish & dairy), energy conservation (up to 20-fold impact), cruelty (\"organic\" animals are deprived of medicines that humans use), and risks of spreading pathogens (not just the flu)\u2026 [noting that] veganism is an issue for which personal and global love of life, health and wealth align. It's a pity to lose parts of our humanity and planet just due to a lack of recipes.\"[100] George identifies as a sentientist.[101] Sentientism is a naturalistic worldview that grants moral consideration to all sentient beings. In the context of the Personal Genome Project, journalists at Forbes and Wired have noted Church's openness about his health issues, including dyslexia, narcolepsy, and high cholesterol (one of the motivations for his vegan diet).[102][103] Church collaborated with transhumanist entrepreneur James Clement on the Supercentenarian Research Study, which aims to sequence the genomes of supercentenarians in hopes of discovering potential genetic factors behind their longevity.[104] Recently Church also entered the personalized pediatrics space. He joined as an advisor to Neurona Health.[105] This company aims to help detect pediatric diseases like autism earlier.","Title":"George Church (geneticist) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11849","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Church"}
