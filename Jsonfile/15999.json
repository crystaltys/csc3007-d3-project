{"Content: ":"Trostianets (also Trostyanets; Ukrainian: Тростянець, pronounced [trosʲtʲɐˈnɛt͡sʲ]) is a city in the Sumy Oblast in Ukraine, and serves as the administrative center of the Trostianets Raion. The city lies on the Boromlya River, 59 km (37 mi) from Sumy. Landmarks include a neo-Gothic \"round courtyard\" (1749), the late Baroque church of the Annunciation (1744\u201350), the 18th-century Galitzine palace, and a \"grotto of nymphs\" (an 1809 centenary memorial to the Battle of Poltava). The city has a population of 19,797 (2021 est.).[1] Many were killed and the city was badly damaged during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Trostianets arose in the first half of the 17th century, during a new wave of migration of peasants and Cossacks from the Right-bank Ukraine to Sloboda Ukraine. The name of the city is associated with the name of the river Trostyanka, which flows nearby. Until 1765, Trostianets was under the jurisdiction of the Okhtyrka Regiment, then - part of Sloboda Ukraine. From 1835 Trostyanets was a part of Kharkov Province of the Russian Empire situated within the Akhtyrka Uyezd. During 1864, the composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky stayed at a villa in Trostianets when composing his overture The Storm.[2] From 1868 to 1874 the estate was owned by a St. Petersburg merchant. In 1874, Trostianets was acquired by the great sugar producer Leopold Koenig. The last owner of the estate until 1917 was his son Julius. In 1877, by order of the Russian Minister of Railways, the Smorodyne locomotive depot was built in Trostianets and 12 steam locomotives were purchased. A local newspaper began to be published in Trostianets in 1930,[3] and in the city[clarification needed] after 1940.[4][5] On 12 July 1940, Trostianets was granted administrative status as a city. During World War II, the city was occupied by Axis troops from October 1941 to August 1943. In January 1989 the population was 25,706 people.[6][5] During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trostianets \u2014 strategically located between the larger settlements of Sumy and Kharkiv \u2014 was attacked by Russian forces shortly after the invasion was launched on 24 February[7] and was captured by them on 1 March 2022.[8] On 4 March, 2022, an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe was reported by local authorities.[clarification needed][9] Trostianets was liberated by the Ukrainian 93rd Mechanized Brigade on 26 March. The city suffered major damage to its infrastructure during the fighting and a Ukrainian official said that the retreating Russian troops had mined a local hospital.[10] The villa Tchaikovsky had stayed in was among buildings destroyed by the Russian troops.[2] The regional prosecutor\u2019s office in Sumy opened an investigation over evidence that Russian troops had thrown hand grenades at civilians protesting the Russian occupation of Trostianets on March 18.[11] After the city had been liberated, the British newspaper The Guardian found evidence of executions, torture and looting.
