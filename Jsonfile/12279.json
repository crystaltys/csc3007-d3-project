{"Content: ":"A natural disaster is a sudden event that always causes widespread destruction, major collateral damage or loss of life, brought about by forces other than the acts of human beings. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslide, hurricanes etc. To be classified as a disaster, it will have profound environmental effect and/or human loss and frequently causes financial loss. This list takes into account only the highest estimated death toll for each disaster, and lists them accordingly. It does not include epidemics and famines. It does not include several volcanic eruptions with uncertain death tolls resulting from collateral effects such as crop failures; see List of volcanic eruptions by death toll. The list also does not include the 1938 Yellow River flood, which was caused by the deliberate destruction of dikes. Note: This list does not include industrial or technological accidents, epidemics, famines or the 1938 Yellow River flood. Note: Some of these famines may have been caused or partially caused by humans. Note: This list is ranked by number of deaths not deaths per capita, as in the percentage of the population. Note: Although there have been no scientifically verified cases of astronomical objects resulting in human fatalities, there have been several reported occurrences throughout human history. Consequently, the casualty figures for all events listed are considered unofficial. Note: Only 2 cases in recorded history. Note: Some of these floods and landslides may be partially caused by humans \u2013 for example, by failure of dams, levees, seawalls or retaining walls. This list does not include the man-made 1938 Yellow River flood caused entirely by a deliberate man-made act (an act of war, destroying dikes). Note: Measuring the number of deaths caused by a heat wave requires complicated statistical analysis, since heat waves tend to cause large numbers of deaths among people weakened by other conditions. As a result, the number of deaths is only known with any accuracy for heat waves in the modern era in countries with developed healthcare systems. Death counts are historical totals unless indicated otherwise. Events in boldface are ongoing. Note: Earlier versions of this list have included the so-called 'Bombay Cyclone of 1882' in tenth position, but this supposed event has been proven to be a hoax. Note: A possible tsunami in 1782 that caused about 40,000 deaths in the Taiwan Strait area may have been of \"meteorological\" origin (a cyclone).[62]","Title":"List of natural disasters by death toll - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12279","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll"}
