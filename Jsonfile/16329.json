{"Content: ":"The 2022 Moscow Victory Day Parade was held in Moscow's Red Square on 9 May 2022 to commemorate the 77th anniversary of both the capitulation of Nazi Germany in the Second World War in 1945 and the historic Moscow Victory Parade of 1945. The parade took place amid the backdrop of Russia's military actions against Ukraine. The parade was not broadcast on some platforms outside of Russia due to social media boycotts and sanctions in response to Russia's invasion.[1][2] Within Russia, anti-war slogans appeared on Russian satellite television[3] as well as on Lenta.ru, a pro-government news website, on Victory Day.[4][5] According to the Russian state-owned TASS news agency, a number of foreign envoys from the Middle East and Africa attended the ceremony. Rodion Miroshnik, the ambassador to Russia from the Luhansk People's Republic (a pro-Russian breakaway region of Ukraine's Donbas region), addressed the crowd in Red Square.[6] There were some expectations or speculations that Vladimir Putin is going to launch a mass-mobilization to Ukraine or even escalate the war. However there was no mass mobilization or any escalation made throughout the day. The Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech at the parade. The speech did not give any specifics regarding the Russian invasion, and did not refer to Ukraine by name in his speech. Putin condemned the Ukrainian government, the West and NATO, blaming their alleged aggressive actions for Russia's invasion and saying that NATO and the West was using Ukraine as a proxy to attack Russia. He also drew parallels between the current Ukrainian government and that of Nazi Germany,[7][8][9][10] praising Russia's military, saying that present troops were \"fighting for the motherland, for her future, and so that nobody forgets the lessons of World War II\".[11]","Title":"2022 Moscow Victory Day Parade - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16329","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Moscow_Victory_Day_Parade"}
