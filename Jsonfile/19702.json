{"Content: ":"The premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Government of New South Wales follows the Westminster Parliamentary System, with a Parliament of New South Wales acting as the legislature. The premier is appointed by the governor of New South Wales, and by modern convention holds office by his or her ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly. Before Federation in 1901 the term \"prime minister of New South Wales\" was also used. \"Premier\" has been used more or less exclusively from 1901, to avoid confusion with the federal prime minister of Australia.[2][3] The current premier is Dominic Perrottet, the leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, who assumed office on 5 October 2021. Perrottet replaced Gladys Berejiklian on 5 October 2021, after Berejiklian resigned as premier.[4] 1891 1907 1917 The median age of a premier on the first day of their first term is roughly 49 years, and 289 days which falls between William McKell and Alexander Mair. The youngest person to assume the office was Dominic Perrottet at 39 years and 14 days. The oldest person to assume office was Bob Heffron at 69 years and 43 days. The oldest living former premier is Barrie Unsworth, born 16 April 1934 (age 88 years, 102 days). The youngest living former premier is Gladys Berejiklian, born 22 September 1970, (age 51 years, 308 days). The youngest living premier is the incumbent Dominic Perrottet, born 21 September 1982, (age 39 years, 309 days). The longest-lived premier was Jack Lang who died on 27 September 1975 aged 98 years and 280 days. Tom Lewis was the second longest-lived premier, aged 94 years and 93 days, 4 years and 187 days short of Lang. The oldest living premier, Barrie Unsworth, will tie Lewis if he lives to 18 July 2028, and tie Lang if he lives to 21 January 2033. The shortest-lived premier was John Storey who died in office at the age of 52 years and 134 days on 5 October 1921. The premier with the longest retirement is Jack Lang. He left office on 13 May 1932, and died 43 years and 137 days later on 27 September 1975. The premier with the shortest retirement is Alexander Stuart, who died on 16 June 1886, 253 days after leaving office on 6 October 1885. [6] Nine former premiers are alive, the oldest being Barrie Unsworth (1986\u20131988, born 1934). The most recent premier to die was John Fahey on 12 September 2020.[7] Not all premiers live to become the oldest of their time. Of the 36 deceased premiers, 16 eventually became the oldest of their time, while 20 did not (including both premiers who died in office, and 18 others). Jack Lang became the oldest living premier when Thomas Bavin died in 1941 and remained so until his death in 1975, for a record 34 years and 27 days. Because he was the first premier, Stuart Donaldson became the oldest living premier when he was appointed in 1856, but he held this distinction for only 81 days. On one occasion the oldest living premier lost this distinction not by his death, but due to the appointment of a premier who was older. Stuart Donaldson lost this distinction when Charles Cowper was appointed. William McKell was the oldest to acquire this distinction at the age of 86 years, and 304 days. Neville Wran, who was aged 87 years, and 191 days when he died, on 20 April 2014 was the oldest premier to die without ever acquiring this distinction. John Fahey who died on 12 September 2020 aged 75 years and 246 days was the most recent premier to die without ever acquiring this distinction.
