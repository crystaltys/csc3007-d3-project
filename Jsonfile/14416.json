{"Content: ":"J. R. Jayewardene UNP Ranasinghe Premadasa UNP Presidential elections were held in Sri Lanka on 19 December 1988. Nominations were accepted on 10 November 1988 and electoral participation was 55.32%. Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa of the governing United National Party was elected, receiving 50.4% of all votes cast. During the 1988 election, Sri Lanka was in chaos. In the north and east, soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force battled Tamil Tiger rebels. In the south, government death squads engaged in deadly violence with equally brutal militants of the Sinhala-nationalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Effective campaigning for both the government and opposition was barely possible. Both of the major party candidates promised to abrogate the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord negotiated by outgoing UNP president J. R. Jayewardene and ask Indian troops to leave the country. Voting was not held in Tiger-controlled areas of the north and east. Aided by its control of the state-owned media, the UNP candidate, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, won a narrow but firm victory.","Title":"1988 Sri Lankan presidential election - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14416","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Sri_Lankan_presidential_election"}
