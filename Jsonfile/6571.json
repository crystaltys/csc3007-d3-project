Versace designed the stage costumes and album cover costumes for Elton John in 1992. Versace has also designed clothing for the Princess of Wales and Princess Caroline of Monaco. The Versace company is known for using the same models in their ads as they do on the runway.[17] After the murder of Gianni Versace in 1997, his sister Donatella Versace, formerly vice-president, took over as creative director, and his older brother Santo Versace became CEO.[20] Donatella's daughter Allegra Versace was left a 50 percent stake in the company, which she assumed control of on her eighteenth birthday.[21][22][23] In 2000, the \"green Versace dress\" worn by Jennifer Lopez at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards gained extensive media attention, being voted as the \"fifth most iconic dress of all time\" in 2008, with Hurley's 1994 dress being voted first in a Daily Telegraph poll.[19] The company's profits were in decline in the early 2000s;[21][24] Fabio Massimo Cacciatori was hired as interim CEO to reorganise and restructure the Versace Group in 2003.[25] Cacciatori resigned in December 2003 due to \"disputes with the Versace family\".[25] From 2004 Giancarlo di Risio, from IT Holding, was CEO of the group until his resignation in 2009 due to disagreements with Donatella.[26][27][28] In May 2016, the Versace Group appointed Jonathan Akeroyd to the position of CEO and member of the company's board of directors.[29] In February 2014, The Blackstone Group purchased a 20 percent stake in Versace for \u20ac210 million.[30][31][32] As of 2016[update], more than 1500 boutiques operate worldwide; the first boutique outside of Italy was opened in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1991.[33] On 24 September 2018, Michael Kors announced that it offered a deal to buy Versace for two billion euros.[34][35] In September 2018 Versace announced that all Blackstone and Versace family shares had been sold to the Group Michael Kors Limited.[36] In October 2018, Versace announced to showcase the brand's first ever Pre-Fall season show in New York on 2 December.

According to the fashion house, the two companies joined forces to channel \"the excitement of buying your first car. Excitement and aspiration of owning something as an extension of one\u2019s personality, something very connected to the idea of being a man.\"[47] On September 26, 2021, Versace presented a joint fashion show with Fendi, titled \"The Swap\",[48] which consisted of two collections \u2013 \"Kim Jones\u2019 vision for Versace and Donatella Versace's interpretation of Fendi.\"[49] This marked the first time two artistic directors of brands in different fashion groups designed collections for each another,[50] with Jones commenting, \"we\u2019ve just done it as friends, and out of respect for each other. It\u2019s never been planned as a commercial thing.\"[51] Versace partnered with the Mind Group firm in China in 2015. The two companies designed luxury residence towers called the \"Versace Residencies.\" The goal of the creators were to combine Versace's luxury home elements with elements of traditional Chinese culture.[52] This same year, Versace partnered with the ABIL Group in India to develop another residential project. These luxury homes are located in South Mumbai.[53] In 2015, Donatella Versace was featured in Riccardo Tisci's Givenchy campaign.[54] Soheil Abedian, of the Sunland Group, approached Versace in 1997 and successfully proposed a luxury hotel built upon the Versace brand; the first Palazzo Versace opened on Australia's Gold Coast on 15 September 2000.[55][56] The hotel was sold to a Chinese consortium in December 2012.[57][58] The second Palazzo, the Palazzo Versace Dubai, was completed in December 2015 and is located on the foreshore of Dubai Creek.[59] A third Palazzo is under construction.
