On 8 December 1989, the West German Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunications (de; one of several predecessors of the present-day Bundesnetzagentur) awarded the second digital GSM-900 (also known as D-Netz (de; D-Network in Germany) network in Germany to Mannesmann, as the first private company in Germany to break the monopoly of the telecommunications services operated by Deutsche Bundespost (now Deutsche Telekom). This licence was subsequently expanded to cover the former East Germany after German reunification in 1991. Mannesmann subsequently began operations of its mobile network on 30 June 1992. It was rebranded Vodafone D2 in 2002. In February 2011, Vodafone Germany started providing IPTV via DSL and VDSL connections.

In February 2020, the Unitymedia brand will be phased out from market, according to Vodafone Germany.[8] The company sponsored the AMG-Mercedes team in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Blancpain Sprint Series and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.
