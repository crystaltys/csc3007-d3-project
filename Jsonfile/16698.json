{"Content: ":"Ghana The Western Togoland Rebellion (French: Rébellion du Togoland de l'Ouest) is an ongoing separatist revolt led by the Ewe nationalist organization Western Togoland Restoration Front (French: Front de restauration du Togoland de l'Ouest; abbreviated WTRF or FRTO)[4] against the government of Ghana. The group seeks the independence of former British Togoland. During World War I, the Allies conquered German Schutzgebiet Togoland and divided the country into British Togoland (Western Togoland) and French Togoland (Eastern Togoland). The British Togoland territory had been a League of Nations mandate, then a United Nations Trust Territory under British control. In 1954, the British government informed the UN that it would be unable to administer the Trust Territory after 1957. In response, in December 1955, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution advising the British government to hold a plebiscite on the future of British Togoland. On 9 May 1956, this plebiscite was held under UN supervision and gave two alternatives to the people: union with soon-to-be Ghana or continuation as a Trust Territory until neighbouring French Togoland had decided upon its future. A third option, independence, was not listed. The Togoland native and dominant ethnic group, the Togolese Ewe people, Togolese Ewe-based Togoland Congress campaigned against and preferred amalgamation with French Togoland. The eventual result was reported to be 58% in favour of integration, although in the southern part of the territory 55% of voters had voted for separation from Gold Coast and continued UN Trusteeship. Despite concerns over the lawfulness of the referendum and questions about Britain's concerns for the peoples of Western Togoland and their will for independence, unification with Ghana as an administrative region became a reality and in 1956 British Togoland was incorporated into Ghana. The majority in the former British Togoland are Ewes and mostly speak the French and the Ewe languages. In 1973, 120 Chiefs of the Volta Regional House of Chiefs (French: Chambre des chefs de la région de la Volta) who demonstrated their opposition to the extension of the Eastern Region of Ghana into the Volta Region faced a violent crackdown by the military forces.[5] In 2017, 7 members of the Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF/FGEP; French: Fondation du Groupe d'étude de la Patrie) were arrested for wearing T-shirts with the inscription \"9 May 2017 is OUR DAY Western Togoland\", referring to the date when the organisation attempted to declare independence.[5] On 5 May 2019, 9 leaders of the HSGF/FGEP who were calling for the independence of parts of Volta and Northern Regions were picked up for planning to declare parts of the Volta and Northern Regions an independent state.[5] On 8 May 2019, The Volta Regional Police Command (French: Commandement de la police régionale de la Volta) in collaboration with the 66 Artillery Regiment arrested an additional 81 members of the HSGF/FGEP for their involvement in planning a protest against the arrest of their leaders. 54 of the suspects were arrested aboard a bus whilst entering Ho from Aflao direction. 17 were arrested in the house of the leader of the group, Charles Kormi Kudzordi near the 66 artillery regiment barracks and 10 were arrested at other entry points into the Ho municipality.[5] They were all later released on bail or let off with a caution.[6] On 8 July 2019, Charles Kormi Kudzordzi was airlifted to the capital Accra to stand trial for treason, only for the state to drop the charges along with 8 other leaders.[6] On 14 December 2019, WTRF/FRTO claimed to have about 2,000 Western Togoland military men and women pass from Gorrilla military school (French: École militaire Gorilles).[2] On 3 August 2020, 17 people living in the Oti Region were prosecuted by Ghana Police Service for speaking French (one of the most spoken languages of Western Togoland).[7][8][9] The Western Togoland Restoration Front declared the sovereignty of Western Togoland on 1 September 2020.
