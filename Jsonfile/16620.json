{"Content: ":"The Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet refers to three bilateral treaties[2] between Russia and Ukraine signed on 28 May 1997 whereby the two countries established two independent national fleets, divided armaments and bases between them,[3][4] and set forth conditions for basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. The treaty was supplemented by provisions in the Russian\u2013Ukrainian Friendship Treaty, which was signed three days later. During the 1990s, the dispute over control of the Black Sea Fleet and Crimean naval facilities were source of tensions between Russia and Ukraine. On June 1995, an interim agreement was signed,[5] however, two additional years were needed to resolve remaining issues Under the terms of the agreements: A fourth agreement, the Kharkiv Pact, was signed on 21 April 2010 and extended the lease until 2042 (with possibility of renewal for an additional five years) in exchange for a multiyear discounted contract to provide Ukraine with Russian natural gas.[8] On 28 March 2014, following the annexation of Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted proposals to the State Duma on terminating a number of Russia\u2013Ukraine agreements, including the Black Sea Fleet partition treaty and the Kharkiv Pact.[9] The State Duma approved the abrogation of these Russian-Ukrainian agreements unanimously by 433 members of parliament on 31 March 2014.[10]","Title":"Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16620","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_Treaty_on_the_Status_and_Conditions_of_the_Black_Sea_Fleet"}
