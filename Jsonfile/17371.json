{"Content: ":"Supreme Court of the Republic President Elvia Barrios The president of the Council of Ministers of Peru, informally called Premier (form of address) or Prime Minister, is the most senior member of the Council of Ministers. The president of the Council of Ministers is appointed by the president (pending ratification by Congress, as with all other cabinet members). The president of the Council of Ministers is not the head of government, since, the president of Peru serves both as head of state and head of government. Peru is one of the few countries in Latin America (others include Argentina, Cuba, and Haiti) where the position of prime minister currently exists. The current Prime Minister is Aníbal Torres, who previously served as Minister of Justice. There has been recent debate on whether the prime minister's role should be strengthened, effectively making the prime minister the head of government, as in countries like France and Russia. This idea was supported by former Peruvian presidents Alan García, Alejandro Toledo, Ollanta Humala, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Martín Vizcarra and Francisco Sagasti.[citation needed]","Title":"President of the Council of Ministers of Peru - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17371","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Council_of_Ministers_of_Peru"}
