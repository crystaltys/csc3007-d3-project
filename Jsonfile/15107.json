It consists of 20 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies. The Assembly sits in Mata Utu, the capital of the territory.

Futuna has 7 seats, 4 for the Alo District and 3 for Sigave.[1][2] The electoral system uses a closed list, with voters voting for a single party. The seats are distributed in each constituency using the highest averages method.[2][3] The powers and competencies of the assembly are a modified version of those originally granted to the Congress of New Caledonia.[1][4] It meets twice a year with an administrative session in the middle of the year and a budgetary session at the end of the year, for a maximum duration of 45 days each. Extraordinary sessions, not exceeding 15 days, can also take place.[4] Debates can take place in French, Wallisian or Futunian. Interpreters are present and the reports can be written in the three languages.[5] The assembly is headed by a president elected every year by its members after the opening of the budgetary session.[4]","Title":"Territorial Assembly of Wallis and Futuna - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15107","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Assembly_of_Wallis_and_Futuna"}
