PCR certificates in other languages are acceptable if they can be validated at the originating station. Digital COVID\u201119 certificates are accepted upon arrival at Dubai International airport verification points.[158][159] COVID\u201119 RT\u2011PCR test certificates must be issued by an authorised facility in the passenger's departure country. Certificates that have already been presented for travel to another destination can't be used for re\u2011entry even if they are still within the validity period.[158] For passengers arriving from the following countries, it is mandatory that the COVID\u201119 PCR report includes a QR code linked to the original report for verification purposes. The QR code must be presented at check\u2011in and to representatives of the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) upon arrival in Dubai airports: Sudan, Lebanon, Egypt and Ethiopia.[158][160] Passengers arriving in Dubai from the following countries will be required to take another COVID\u201119 PCR test on arrival at Dubai International airport: Afghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Russia, Senegal, Slovakia, Somaliland, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe.[159] On 29 March, the Dubai Metro and Dubai Tram were suspended until 26 April.[161][162][163] Roads On 27 March, Dubai lifted their ban on trucks weighting 2.5 tonnes.[164] On 31 March, Abu Dhabi installed a disinfection gate at one of its bus stations.[165] On 14 April, Inter-city bus services was suspended in Sharjah until further notice,[166] and Dubai Municipality issued a circular restricting the movement of workers to other emirates; where the transport of labor workers to areas outside of Dubai will be prohibited, as movement will be restricted to the boundaries of the emirate, the purpose of which is to restrict the outside entry of workers not residing in Dubai, and to be implemented to date[167] The UAE introduced criminal penalties for spreading false information and rumours related to the outbreak.[168][169] On 22 April, Reuters reported that about hundreds of low-income migrant workers were seen queuing up across the road outside an Abu Dhabi hospital with the temperature outdoors exceeding 35 degrees Celsius, to get tested for Coronavirus. The tests were free of charge only if the person shows symptoms, has travel history, or has come in contact with a positive case. However, if not, the test costs around 370 dirham ($100). The doctors confirmed a sharp daily increase in the number of positive cases specifically in the densely populated communities that house low-income group workers.[170] Abu Dhabi exhibitions now accept results from 96-hour COVID-19 PCR tests.[171] In December 2020, the UAE started its Emirates-wide vaccination campaigns. On 9 December of 2020, the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) announced that it will be offering the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, and on 22 December of 2020, it announced the emergency registration of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech vaccine.[172] For six months, the UAE launched a COVID-19 vaccination campaign, initially with the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine vaccine, then adding the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech, Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccines.[173] The vaccines are offered at a wide range of health centres and hospitals in all of the Emirates, and are given free of charge. The UAE currently offers four vaccines for eligible residents and citizens, one by Sinopharm, the other by Pfizer-BioNTech, the third Sputnik V and the latest by Oxford-AstraZeneca.[172] In an effort to return to complete normalcy, UAE officials announced that starting 6 June 2021, those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine and have with them a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours will be allowed to attend events and activities in the country.[174] In Abu Dhabi, the Emergency, Crisis and Disasters Committee increased workplace attendance up to 60 percent in government entities and companies starting from 30 May 2021.[175] By 17 March 2021, more than half of the population of the United Arab Emirates received the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech and Sinopharm vaccines. Around seven million doses were distributed to more than 205 medical centers around the country.[176] In March 2021, the UAE announced it intends on reaching herd immunity.[177] In April 2021, the UAE recorded a vaccination rate of 100.10 doses per 100 people. [178] The UAE's National Crisis and Emergency Management Authority (NCEMA) said that the UAE is at the top of the worldwide vaccine distribution rate, becoming the first country in vaccine distribution per 100 people worldwide. A month later, NCEMA reported that as of 16 June 2021, over 13,964,439 million vaccine doses had been administered since the beginning of the vaccination campaign.[179] According to figures by NCEMA provided at the end of May 2021, more than 78.11 per cent of residents and citizens in the UAE have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Furthermore, 84.59 percent of those aged 60 and above have been vaccinated.[180] Covering that percentage prompted NCEMA in June 2021 to announce that it will be prioritizing booster shots for the elderly and those with chronic diseases as an additional part of its vaccination efforts. In Dubai, vaccination was also extended to 12 to 15-year-olds for the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, according to Dubai's Media Office.[181] Up to June 2021, the Reuters Covid Tracker reported that nearly 85 percent of the UAE's total eligible population had received at least one dose of a vaccine. The agency calculated that assuming every person needs 2 doses, that is enough to have vaccinated about 70.9% of the country's population.[182][183][184] In Dubai in particular, by the middle of June 2021, about two-thirds of people eligible for vaccination against the virus had received two doses of the vaccine, stated the Dubai Health Authority (DHA). Out of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, Dubai is the most populated, and it has one of the world's busiest airports.[185] DHA deputy director general Alawi Alsheikh Ali has thus said that 83 percent of people aged over 16 - or about 2.3 million people - had now received at least one dose of a vaccine, and that 64 percent had received two doses in the emirate. However, the DHA also reported that nearly 20 percent of those most vulnerable to serious illness have not yet been vaccinated.[185][186] In March 2021, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and Wang Yi, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister, met in the UAE to set up a regional vaccination for Chinese nationals.[187] In May 2021, the centre was launched and a programme dubbed \u2018Spring Sprout Action\u2019 administered by the Dubai Health Authority allowed Chinese nationals over the age of 16 who hold a short-term visa without UAE residency to receive two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine.[188] Hundreds of Chinese citizens on visit visas to the UAE took advantage of the programme. The Chinese visitors were the first non-residents to be offered COVID-19 vaccines in the UAE. About 200 registered and received the vaccine at the Safa healthcare centre in Dubai.[189][190] To facilitate the vaccination process, the DHA launched a booking facility via its official WhatsApp line. They stated that this was in an effort to facilitate the booking of appointments by using artificial intelligence. Before launching the WhatsApp booking option at the beginning of June 2021, residents booked their vaccine appointment either by telephone or via the official DHA smartphone app.[191][192][193] In late June 2021, Abu Dhabi announced that it will be offering free COVID-19 vaccines to everyone with an expired residency visa or expired entry visa.[194] The move was done to help those who were affected by job losses or travel restrictions during the pandemic and so their visas have expired or have been cancelled when they were made redundant.[195][196] As a result of confusion among the population, the Abu Dhabi Media Office issued a reminder that the decision does not include holders of valid tourist or visit visas.[197][198] Those looking to get the vaccine through this decision can book the Sinopharm and Pfizer vaccines via the Seha app.[199]  ","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10522","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates"}
