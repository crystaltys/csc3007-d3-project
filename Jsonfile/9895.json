{"Content: ":"The 2022 monkeypox outbreak in Brazil is a part of the ongoing outbreak of human monkeypox caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. The outbreak was first reported in Brazil on 9 June 2022 when a man in São Paulo was registered as the country's index case.[1] Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and some other animals.[2] Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over.[2] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from five to twenty-one days.[3][4] The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks.[4] There may be mild symptoms, and it may occur without any symptoms being known.[3][5] The classic presentation of fever and muscle pains, followed by swollen glands, with lesions all at the same stage, has not been found to be common to all outbreaks.[2][6] Cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems.[7] The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus. The variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is also in this genus.[8] Of the two types in humans, the West African type causes a less severe disease than the Central African (Congo basin) type.[9] It may spread from infected animals by handling infected meat or via bites or scratches.[10] Human-to-human transmission can occur through exposure to infected body fluids or contaminated objects, by small droplets, and possibly through the airborne route.[2][10] People can spread the virus from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and fallen off; with some evidence of spread for more than a week after lesions have crusted.[9] Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing a lesion for the virus's DNA.[11] An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox, a viral disease, was confirmed in May 2022.[18] The initial cluster of cases was found in the United Kingdom,[19] where the first case was detected on 6 May 2022 in an individual with travel links to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic).[20] The outbreak marked the first time monkeypox has spread widely outside Central and West Africa. From 18 May onwards, cases were reported from an increasing number of countries and regions, predominantly in Europe but also in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.[27] On 23 July, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), raising the status of the outbreak to a global health emergency.[28][29] As of 28 July, there were a total of 20,846 confirmed cases.[30] A large portion of those infected were believed to have not recently traveled to areas of Africa where monkeypox is normally found, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa. It is believed to be transmitted by close contact with sick people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing. The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa.[33] In addition to more common symptoms, such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and rashes or lesions, some patients have also experienced proctitis, an inflammation of the rectum lining. CDC has also warned clinicians to not rule out monkeypox in patients with sexually transmitted infections since there have been reports of co-infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes.[34] Three suspected monkeypox cases were reported in Brazil on 30 May 2022.[35] On 9 June, a 41-year-old man, who had recently travelled to Spain and Portugal and had been admitted to a São Paulo hospital, tested positive for the virus.[1]","Title":"2022 monkeypox outbreak in Brazil - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9895","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_monkeypox_outbreak_in_Brazil"}
