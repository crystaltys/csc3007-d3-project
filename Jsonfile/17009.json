{"Content: ":"Minority The South Carolina House of Representatives is the lower house of the South Carolina General Assembly. It consists of 124 representatives elected to two-year terms at the same time as U.S. congressional elections. Unlike many legislatures, seating on the floor is not divided by party, but is arranged by county delegation \u2013 a legacy of the original apportionment of the chamber. Until 1964, each of South Carolina's counties was a legislative district, with the number of representatives determined by the county's population. It meets from the second week of January into May. In Colonial times, there was a Commons House of Assembly.[1] Representatives are considered part-time citizen legislators who serve two-year terms. Representatives are elected at-large by their district, and there are no term limits.[2] Representatives must be 21 years of age before they are eligible to become a representative.[3] (a) 21 were members of the Union Reform Party of South Carolina and the other 3 were Independents from Anderson. Two of the Union Reform members from Chesterfield were later replaced by Republicans from a resolution passed in the House. (b) All 33 were members of the Conservative Party of South Carolina. (c) All 17 were Independent Democrats.
