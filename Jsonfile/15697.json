{"Content: ":"Pripyat (/ˈpriːpjət, ˈprɪp-/ PREE-pyət, PRIP-yət; Russian: При́пять), also known as Prypiat or Prypyat (Ukrainian: При́пʼять, Prypiat, IPA: [ˈprɪpjɐtʲ]), is a ghost city in northern Ukraine, located near the border with Belarus. Named after the nearby river, Pripyat, it was founded on 4 February 1970 as the ninth atomgrad (a type of closed town in the Soviet Union) to serve the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which is located in the adjacent ghost city of Chernobyl.[3] Pripyat was officially proclaimed a city in 1979 and had grown to a population of 49,360[4] by the time it was evacuated on the afternoon of 27 April 1986, one day after the Chernobyl disaster.[5] Although it was located within the administrative district of Ivankiv Raion (now Vyshhorod Raion since the 2020 raion reform), the abandoned municipality now has the status of city of regional significance within the larger Kyiv Oblast, and is administered directly from the capital of Kyiv. Pripyat is also supervised by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, which manages activities for the entire Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the entire population of Pripyat was moved to the purpose-built city of Slavutych. Access to Pripyat, unlike cities of military importance, was not restricted before the disaster, as the Soviet Union deemed nuclear power stations safer than other types of power plants. Nuclear power stations were presented as achievements of Soviet engineering, harnessing nuclear power for peaceful projects. The slogan \"peaceful atom\" (Russian: мирный атом, romanized: mirnyy atom) was popular during those times. The original plan had been to build the plant only 25 km (16 mi) from Kyiv, but the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, among other bodies, expressed concern that would be too close to the city. As a result, the power station and Pripyat[6] were built at their current locations, about 100 km (62 mi) from Kyiv. After the disaster, the city of Pripyat was evacuated in two days.[7] In 1986, the city of Slavutych was constructed to replace Pripyat. After the city of Chernobyl, this was the second-largest city for accommodating power plant workers and scientists in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). One notable landmark often featured in photographs of the city and visible from aerial-imaging websites is the long-abandoned Ferris wheel located in the Pripyat amusement park, which had been scheduled to have its official opening five days after the disaster, in time for May Day celebrations.[8][9] The Azure Swimming Pool and Avanhard Stadium are two other popular tourist sites. On 4 February 2020, former residents of Pripyat gathered in the abandoned city to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pripyat's establishment. This was the first time former residents returned to the city since its abandonment in 1986.[10] The 2020 Chernobyl Exclusion Zone wildfires reached the outskirts of the town, but they did not reach the plant.[citation needed] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city was occupied by Russian forces during the Battle of Chernobyl after several hours of heavy fighting.[11] On 31 March 2022, Russian troops withdrew from the plant and other parts of Kyiv Oblast.[12][13] On 3 April 2022, Ukrainian troops took control of Pripyat again.[14][15] The following statistics are from 1 January 1986.[16] A concern is whether it is safe to visit Pripyat and its surroundings. The Zone of Alienation is considered relatively safe to visit, and several Ukrainian companies offer guided tours around the area.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][excessive citations] In most places within the city, the level of radiation does not exceed an equivalent dose of 1 μSv (one microsievert) per hour.[26] The climate of Pripyat is designated as Dfb (Warm-summer humid continental climate) on the Köppen Climate Classification System.[27] (Alphabetical by title) (Alphabetical by game title) (Alphabetical by artist) (Alphabetical by artist) (Alphabetical by series) The city was served by Yaniv station on the Chernihiv\u2013Ovruch railway. It was an important passenger hub of the line and was located between the southern suburb of Pripyat and the village of Yaniv. An electric train terminus of Semikhody, built in 1988 and located in front of the nuclear plant, is currently the only operating station near Pripyat connecting it to Slavutych.[46] Pripyat in winter Pripyat in winter A gate in Pripyat city, 2000 Ferris wheel of the Pripyat amusement park Polissya hotel Pripyat city limit sign Palace of Culture Energetik \u2014 artistic, cultural, entertainment and recreational activities center The former football stadium of Pripyat Abandoned football ground Forest area near the city Pripyat pier Abandoned school Pripyat after the disaster Pripyat skyline Pripyat bumper car floor Coordinates: 51°24\u203220\u2033N 30°03\u203225\u2033E﻿ / ﻿51.40556°N 30.05694°E﻿ / 51.40556; 30.05694","Title":"Pripyat - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15697","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat"}
