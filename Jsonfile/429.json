{"Content: ":"Altmuehlopterus (meaning \"Altmühl River wing\") is a genus of pterosaur belonging to the Pterodactyloidea. It lived in the Late Jurassic of what is now Germany. It was formerly known as \"Daitingopterus\" (meaning \"Daiting Wing\"), a nomen nudum, informally coined in 2004.[1] In 1851, Johann Andreas Wagner named a new species of Ornithocephalus (a now-obsolete name for the genus Pterodactylus), Ornithocephalus ramphastinus. The specific name referred to the toucan genus Ramphastos, in view of the large beak-like snout of the pterosaur.[2] In 1859/1860, Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer corrected the specific name to rhamphastinus.[3] Although this was incorrect by modern standards, the new spelling has become valid by being accepted and used by subsequent authors, under article ICZN 33.3.1.[4] The holotype, BSP AS.I.745, was probably found at Mörnsheim near Daiting in a layer of the Malm Zeta 3, dating from the Tithonian. It consists of a partly articulated skeleton with skull, preserved on a plate and counterplate. In 1871, Harry Govier Seeley included the specimen in the type material of Diopecephalus, without, however, designating it as the holotype of this genus.[5] For this reason, Peter Wellnhofer felt free to name the specimen as a second species of Germanodactylus in 1970: Germanodactylus rhamphastinus.[6] In 2004, Michael Maisch e.a. concluded that it represented a new genus, which they indicated as \"Daitingopterus\" in a diagram.[1] It remained a nomen nudum.[7] In 2017, Steven Vidovic and David Martill validly named a separate genus Altmuehlopterus. The generic name combines a reference to the river Altmühl, running through Solnhofen, with a Latinised Greek pteron, \"wing\".[7]   ","Title":"Altmuehlopterus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"429","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmuehlopterus"}
