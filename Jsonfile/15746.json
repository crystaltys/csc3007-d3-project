{"Content: ":"Mykolaiv (Ukrainian: Миколаїв, pronounced [mɪkoˈlɑjiu̯] (listen)), also known as Nikolaev (Russian: Николаев, pronounced [nʲɪkɐˈla(j)ɪf]), is a city and municipality in southern Ukraine, the administrative center of the Mykolaiv Oblast. Mykolaiv is located on the Southern Bug with access to the Black Sea and is one of the main shipbuilding centers of the Black Sea. Aside from three shipyards within the city, there are a number of research centers specializing in shipbuilding such as the State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center, Zoria-Mashproekt and others. The city has a population of 476,101 (2021 est.).[2] The city is an important transportation hub of Ukraine (sea port, commercial port, river port, highway and railway junction, airport). Mykolaiv's orderly layout reflects the fact that its development has been well planned from the founding of the city. Its main streets, including the three main east\u2013west Avenues, are very wide and tree-lined. Much of Mykolaiv's land area consists of parks. Park Peremohy (Victory) is a large park on the peninsula just north of the city center of Mykolaiv, on the north side of the Inhul river. The city is known under two names in Ukrainian and Russian; there are several transliterations of each name. The Ukrainian name of the city is Микола́їв, transliterated as Mykolaiv or (officially) Mykolayiv. The Russian name, Никола́ев, transliterates as Nikolaev or as Nikolayev. The city's founding was made possible by the Russian conquests during the Second Russo-Turkish War of 1787\u20131792. Founded by Prince Grigory Potemkin as Nikolaev, it was the last of the many cities he established. On 27 August 1789,[3] Potemkin ordered its naming near the wharf at the mouth of the Ingul river, on a high, cool and breezy spot where the Ingul river meets the Southern Bug river. To build the city he brought in peasants, soldiers, and Turkish prisoners; 2,500 were working there during 1789. The shipyards were built first (1788).[4] Potemkin named the city after Saint Nicholas, the patron of seafarers, on whose day (6 December) he had obtained victory at the siege of Ochakov[5] in 1788. The name Nikolaev is known from the legal order (writ) Number 1065 by Prince Potemkin to Mikhail Faleev [ru] dated 27 August 1789.[6] In 1920, after the establishment of Soviet power, the Odessa provincial council (of laborers and peasants' deputies) petitioned the Soviet Ukrainian government\u2014the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee (VUTSIK)\u2014to rename the city of Mykolaiv to Vernoleninsk. As the city of Mykolaiv was a district center of the Odessan province, presumably, the petition would have been initiated by the Odessa city council, but documentary evidence of this so far has not been identified. On 15 April 1924 the Plenum of the Central Administrative-Territorial Commission of the VUTSIK considered and rejected the petition of the Odessan executive committee. Perhaps the members of the Soviet-Ukraine government thought that the name sounded too obsequious.[7] Information regarding the alleged renaming of Mykolaiv was disseminated by German maps of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as in German encyclopedic publications in 1927 and 1932, which show Vernoleninsk on the USSR part of the European maps. The city was designated as Mykolaiv in publications of the same map in other languages.[7] To distinguish Mykolaiv from the much smaller west Ukraine city of Mykolaiv in Lviv Oblast, the latter is sometimes called \"Mykolaiv on the Dniester\" after the major river that it is situated on, while the former is located on the Southern Bug, another major river, and may also be called \"Mykolaiv on the Bug\". Mykolaiv is the administrative center of Mykolaiv Oblast (region), as well as that of both Mykolaiv and Vitovka raions (districts) within the oblast. It is administratively incorporated as a city of oblast significance, and does not belong to any of the two raions. Mykolaiv is located on a peninsula in Ukraine's steppe region 65 kilometers (40 mi) from the Black Sea along the estuary of the Southern Bug river (where it meets the Inhul River).[8] Both the Inhul River and the Southern Bug River follow very winding courses just before they join at the northeast corner of Mykolaiv. This has created several long and narrow peninsulas just north of Mykolaiv, and the main part of Mykolaiv is itself on a peninsula at a 180-degree bend in the Southern Bug River. Mykolaiv is in a primarily flat terrain area (the steppe grain-producing region of southern Ukraine). The nearest mountains to Mykolaiv are 300 kilometres (186 miles) south, at the southern end of the Crimean Peninsula. The lack of any mountain barriers north of Mykolaiv means that very cold Arctic winds can blow south, unimpeded by any terrain elevation, to Mykolaiv in winter. The area of the city is 260 square kilometres (100 sq mi).[9] Mykolaiv is in the second time zone (Eastern European Time). Mykolaiv's environmental issues are typical for many cities in Ukraine: pollution of water, the air, and groundwater; drinking water quality, noise, waste management, and conservation of biological diversity in the city.[10] One of Mykolaiv's most urgent problems is the disposal of solid household waste.[11] The city has 18 preserved sites, totaling about 12 square kilometres (5 sq mi):[12] The city's climate is moderately continental with mild winters and hot summers.[8][14] Mykolaiv's average temperature is 10 °C (50 °F). The lowest average temperature is in January −3.1 °C (26 °F), the highest in July 22.3 °C (72 °F).[14] Mykolaiv has an average of 472 mm (19 in) of precipitation per year, with the lowest precipitation in October, and the most in July. Mykolaiv has snow cover every year, but its height is low.[14] Average relative humidity is 73% for the year; the lowest humidity is in August (60%); the highest in December (86%).[14] The lowest cloud are seen in August; the highest are in December.[14] The prevailing winds come from the North; the least frequent source of wind is the Southeast. The maximum wind speed is in February, the lowest is from July through September. In January, the average wind speed is 4.1 m/s (meters per second); in July, the average is 3.1 m/s.[14] Archaeologists have found proof of ancient settlements on the territory of Mykolaiv.[23] In 2018, archaeologists discovered a sunken Ancient Greek ship near the Mykolaiv region - it dated from the 5th century BC, the period of Greek colonization of the Northern Black Sea. Researchers stated: \"This Ancient Greek ship is one of the oldest known in the Northern Black Sea.\"[24] The city has long had close associations with shipbuilding.[25] The town was founded in 1789 by the Russian Governor General of Novorossiya, Prince Grigory Potemkin, initially as a shipyard called simply a New Shipyard on the Ingul river[citation needed]. Prince Potemkin signed an order to construct a shipyard on 27 August 1789, which is considered to be the city's birth date.[citation needed] The shipyard was intended to undertake the repair of naval ships in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1792. Later,[when?] Potemkin ordered the shipyard to be named Nikolaev to commemorate the date when Ochakov fell to the Russian troops under his command on 6 December 1788, the feast day of Saint Nicholas (Nikolai) in the Russian Orthodox Church calendar.[citation needed] The Russian Empire's Black Sea Navy Headquarters was in Mykolaiv for more than 100 years until the Imperial Russian Navy moved it to Sevastopol, near the southern tip of the Crimean Peninsula. During the Crimean War (1853-1856), Mykolaiv became the main rear base to support Russia's efforts in the war. Most businesses that were created in the city belonged to the military-industrial complex, and, consequently, Mykolaiv was closed to foreigners for many decades.[26][dead link] In March 1816, Admiral Aleksey Greig was appointed Governor of the city. While in that post until 1833, he did much for Mykolaiv. Port facilities were built. A credit society (cooperative) was established, and Mykolaiv increased its seaborne trade.[citation needed] Morskoii (Marine) Boulevard was built in the city, along with sidewalks. In addition, open men's and women's colleges were built, as was a shelter. In 1820, Admiral Greig founded the Marine Astronomical Observatory in Mykolaiv. In 1826 he established the Russian Navy's first headquarters in Nikolayev. It was the location for fleet combat-training and war planning.[citation needed] From 1860 to 1871, the military Governor of Mykolaiv was Bogdan von Glazenap [ru]. His highest command in the town[clarification needed] was in 1862. He encouraged foreign vessels to call at the commercial port and encouraged foreigners to settle in Mykolaiv. As a result, foreign governments established consulates there.[27] This led to the transformation of Mykolaiv into a large commercial port.[citation needed] By the late 19th century, Mykolaiv's port ranked third in the Russian Empire (after Saint Petersburg and Odessa) in trade with foreign countries. Grain-export suppliers of the steppe region (of Ukraine and Southern Russia) were the greatest in the Russian Empire. Mykolaiv had become a great industrial center in the Southern Ukraine.[26] Mykolaiv was a major Jewish centre of the Russian Empire in the 19th century.[citation needed] In the 19th century, the Czarist governments largely banned Jews from living east of the Dnieper River. Mykolaiv is in the area west of the Dnieper, which was where Jews were legally allowed to reside (the Pale of Settlement). The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson (the seventh leader in the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty) was born in Mykolaiv on 18 April 1902. In 1918, Mykolaiv was occupied by foreign troops. In 1920, Soviet power was established.[26] In the course of Operation Barbarossa Mykolaiv was occupied on 16 August 1941. In September, German forces massacred over 35,000 non-combatants, many of them Jews, in the city and its region. During the occupation, an underground partisan sabotage group, the Mykolaiv Center, conducted guerilla activities. On 28 March 1944 the city was liberated, in part because of Soviet Senior Lieutenant Konstantin F. Olshansky's paratroopers and their daring raid during which the majority of his troops were killed. In the post-war period Mykolaiv became one of the shipbuilding centers of the USSR, with three shipyards: Black Sea, 61 Kommunara, and Okean. The asteroid 8141 Nikolaev (1982 SO4) was discovered in 1982 by Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and was named in honor of the city.[28] In March 2012, Mykolaiv gained international notoriety for lawlessness and police corruption following the rape and murder of Oksana Makar.[29] Her three attackers were apprehended, but two were released because of family connections to local government officials. After a media outcry and public protests, all three attackers were charged with her murder. During the Euromaidan protests of 2013-1014, Mykolayiv was the scene of anti-Yanukovich protests. After the victory of Euromaidan, the situation calmed down somewhat until 7 April 2014, when some pro-Russians tried to take over the local administration building. Pro-Ukrainians stopped them from taking over the administration building and destroyed the pro-Russian camp not far from it, after which the situation in the city became calm.[30] In February and March 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian military forces attacked Mykolaiv and placed it under siege.[31] Ukrainian forces barred Russian forces from the city, though Russian artillery continued to shell it.[32] Three people were killed and six injured when a community in the Mykolaiv region came under fire early Tuesday morning, the mayor of Mykolaiv has said. (June 28 2022) As of 2017, 63% of the population spoke Russian at home, 7% Ukrainian, and 28% spoke both Ukrainian and Russian equally.[38] The Soviet Government awarded Mykolaiv the Order of the Red Banner of Labour on 31 December 1970, for successfully fulfilling its assignments for the development of industrial production, in the USSR's five-year economic plan. Mykolaiv is divided into four districts: Mykolaiv adopted its current coat of arms on 26 September 1997. Its design came from the one adopted in 1883, by removing the symbol of Kherson province to which Mykolaiv didn't belong anymore.[39] Mykolaiv adopted its current flag on 2 July 1999 and its anthem on 11 September 2004.[39] Today Mykolaiv is a major shipbuilding center of Ukraine (as, earlier, of the whole Soviet Union) and an important river port. The city has three major shipyards one of which is capable of building large navy ships. Other important industries are mechanical engineering, power engineering, metallurgy and last 10 years \u2013 food industry. Mykolaiv was closed to foreign visitors until the late 1980s because of many clandestine Soviet Navy projects (as well as the Mykolaiv Air Force base, turbine factory and military port). The majority of the Soviet Navy's surface ships including its only aircraft carrier, the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov were built in Mykolaiv. In May 2011, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych visited Mykolaiv and said that Ukraine is serious about reviving and further developing of its shipbuilding industry in the Mykolaiv region.[40] One of the largest enterprises in the city is Mykolaiv Aluminia Factory, which produces aluminia, raw material for the production of aluminum.[citation needed] In addition to heavy industry, the city has a developed food processing industry, including a juice maker, Sandora, a dairy products maker, Laktalis-Mykolaiv, and a brewery, Yantar. The enterprise Nibulon is one of the leaders in the Ukrainian agrarian market.[citation needed] The Mykolaiv Armored Factory has been a large repair facility for Ukraine's military during the War in Donbass. Engineers at the plant designed an armored ambulance based on the BTR-70 to be used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.[41] In January 2017, Mykolaiv Development Agency released a promo video of the city's investment potential.[42] Mykolaiv, being an important strategic city in southern Ukraine has a significant Ukrainian military presence, including the shipyards that build Ukraine's surface navy ships, the Mykolaiv Ukrainian Navy base, the \"MARP\" aircraft repair factory (Mykolaiv), and the Kulbakino army base (in the Mykolaiv Oblast, outside of the city of Mykolaiv).[citation needed] Previously for many years after World War II the city had been home to the 92nd Guards Motor Rifle Division, the former 92nd Guards Rifle Division. The 79th Airmobile Brigade is based in the city.[43] Mykolaiv is one of Ukraine's most important transportation junctions. It is a major commercial river and sea port, and a major highway and rail junction.[44] Mykolaiv also has a dual-function passenger and freight airport, but passenger service at the airport is not significant, compared to Ukraine's major airports. In addition to the airport and sea and river port, Mykolaiv has two train stations, and an intercity bus station. Mykolaiv Airport (IATA code NLV), one of the largest and most technically well equipped airports in the South of Ukraine[citation needed], serves the city. The airport, located northwest of Mykolaiv, is mainly used for air freight and only has limited passenger service. Russian airline UTAir Aviation offers flights from Mykolaiv to Moscow (Vnukovo \u2013 VKO airport). In addition, there are one-hour passenger flights from Odessa (the nearest major airport) to Mykolaiv. Almost all airline passenger service in the South West of Ukraine (where Mykolaiv is located) is through Odessa International Airport: to reach Mykolaiv by airplane, tourists generally reach Odessa by plane, and then take a bus, taxi or train, for approximately 2 hours, to Mykolaiv. Odessa, the largest city in South West Ukraine, is 132 km (82 miles) from Mykolaiv.[45] Kulbakyno airport, also known as Nikolaev, is a Class I military air base located just to the southeast of the city center, in Kulbakyno. It primarily supports wings of Sukhoi Su-24, Sukhoi Su-25, Sukhoi Su-27, and Mikoyan MiG-29.[46] Mykolaiv is an 8.5-hour bus ride from Kyiv's main bus station.[47] Ukrainian private national bus companies Gyunsel and Avtoluks operate overnight buses from Kyiv to Mykolaiv seven nights per week. The bus station in Mykolaiv is located at Prospekt (Avenue) Bohoyavlenskyi 21. The main north\u2013south highway that passes through Mykolaiv is H (or M)-14. The main East-West Highway that passes through Mykolaiv is E-58 M-14 (West and then South to Odessa), and South East to Kherson, a major port on the Dneper River, just before it flows into the Black Sea. The E-58 M-14 then continues East to the major industrial city and port in South Eastern Ukraine, Mariupol'. The main highways to and from Mykolaiv are from Kherson (65 km (40 mi)), Odessa (120 km (75 mi)), Uman (320 km (199 mi)), Chişinău (Kishniev), Moldova (325 km (202 mi)), the Crimean Peninsula (350 km (217 mi), Kyiv (500 km (311 mi), Kharkiv (520 km (323 mi), Lviv (350 km (217 mi) (Western Ukraine). Ukraine's roads, including those leading from Mykolaiv, tend to be poorly maintained and can be very dangerous. Roads through Mykolaiv include: the road M14 (Odessa \u2014 Novoazovsk), having an exit to the main highway M18 (Yalta \u2014 Simferopol \u2014 Kharkiv). Roads to/from Mykolaiv include: Mykolaiv, being located at the confluence of two major rivers, has two main bridges. The Varvarivskyi Bridge over Southern Bug is a swing bridge with Europe's largest span (134 m).[48] It is also the southernmost bridge over the Southern Bug. The bridge connects the North coast of Mykolaiv to its Tsentralnyi Raion, located on the West Bank of the river. The Odeske Highway crosses the bridge and then continues south-west to Odessa. Another major bridge is the Inhul Bridge crossing the Inhul River. The bridge leads from the north coast of Mykolaiv, and goes north-northeast to the peninsula on the north side of the Inhul, just north of Mykolaiv. On the north Side of the Inhul River, the Heroyiv Stalingrada Highway crosses the bridge, streaming into Pushkinska Street on the other side. Overnight train travel in sleeper-berth passenger trains is a very common way to travel long distances in Ukraine, cheaper, more comfortable and faster than buses \u2013 and more environment-friendly, for that matter. There are nightly trains from Kyiv's main passenger train station to Mykolaiv.[49] In addition to Kyiv, trains from Mykolaiv regularly run to the two closest major cities to Mykolaiv: Odessa (south west of Mykolaiv); and Kherson (south of Mykolaiv).[50] Direct trains to Moscow (26 hours), Kyiv (8-10), Lviv (18), Odesa (5), the Crimea (8 hours) depart every day. Train departures timetable. All trains have coach cars. Mykolaiv's passenger train station is called Mykolaiv \u2013 Passenger. It at the intersection of Myru Avenue and Novozavodska Street 5 (in Ukraine street address numbers are placed after the street name).[50] From the city square outside the railway station, buses depart to all other parts of Mykolaiv. Mykolaiv's freight train station is called Mykolaiv-Gruzovoi (Freight). It is located at Pryvokzalna ploshcha (Square).[50] Though a major Ukrainian commercial sea port, Mykolaiv has no regular passenger water-borne service. Water transport is offered by three sea ports and one river port, and also by several terminals. The port is linked with the sea by Dnieper-Bug Estuary canal. The canal begins at the island Berezan and extends 44 kilometers (27 miles) until it reaches the port of Mykolaiv. The canal consistes of 13 tracks, 6 of which reach Dnieper Estuary, and the rest \u2014 along the river Southern Bug. The width of the canal is 100 meters (330 feet). Its depth is 10.5 meters (35'). Large ocean-going ships can reach Mykolaiv year round, via the Southern Bug River. The Southern Bug River, which flows into the Black Sea 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of Mykolaiv, is 1.5 km (0.9 miles) wide in Mykolaiv. Mykolaiv's passenger river port is at Varvarovskii Spusk (Descent) 5.[50] The ports are: The main forms of city transport are fixed-route marshrutkas, buses, trolley buses, and trams. The length of Mykolaiv's streetcar (tram) lines is 73 kilometers (45 miles). From 1897 until 1925 Mykolaiv's streetcars were pulled by horses. Streetcars began to be powered by electricity in 1915, and this has continued through the present. At their inception, the tracks were 1000 millimeters (3'), but during the period from 1952 to 1972 they were switched to standard gauge. The length of Mykolaiv's trolley bus lines is 59 kilometers (37 miles). Mykolaiv's trolley buses have operated since 29 October 1967. There are several universities in Mykolaiv. The main universities are: Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding (leading shipbuilding university in Ukraine), Petro Mohyla Black Sea State University, Sukhomlinsky National University of Mykolaiv and Mykolaiv State Agrarian University. Sukhomlinsky National University of Mykolaiv is the oldest university in Mykolaiv. The idea of the university foundation arose in the 1860s, but it was realized only on July 18, 1913, when the Mykolaiv Teacher's Institute was founded. Nowadays there are 7,000 students studying at the university, 300 teachers working at 36 departments. Annually, the university graduates 1,000 specialists and 60-70 undergraduates.[citation needed] There are 10 higher education institutions in Mykolaiv of level III or IV accreditation. 65 general education schools, lycees, gymnasium schools, 3 evening schools, and 12 private learning institutions are in the city.
