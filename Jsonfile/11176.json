{"Content: ":"SKYCovione (pipeline name: GBP510) is a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by SK Bioscience and the Institute for Protein Design of the University of Washington,[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] It is South Korea\u2019s first homegrown Covid-19 vaccine[8] and utilizes GSK's AS03 adjuvant technology. The phase III clinical trial involves 4,037 participants. Should the trial confirm GBP510's efficacy and safety, the vaccine is expected to be approved in the first half of 2022.[9][10][11][12] On 29 April 2022, it was reported that the results of the Phase 3 trial confirmed the vaccine to be safe and effective. It elicited approximately 3 times more antibodies than the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Should the vaccine be approved by health regulators, it will be distributed via the COVAX program. The South Korean Government has ordered 10 million doses for domestic use.[13] A booster dose trial is being planned. The booster is to be given 6 months after the second dose is administered.[12] The Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety released the results of their review on SK Bioscience\u2019s SKYCovione on June 27, 2022 and said the data was sufficient for approval.[8] According to the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, vaccine-related adverse events occurred in 13.3% of the vaccine group. In the control group, the adverse event rate was about 14.6%, which was not different from the vaccine group. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.5% in the vaccine group and 0.5% in the control group. There was one adverse event of glomerulonephritis which could not be excluded from vaccine association.[8] On June 29, 2022, SKYCovione has been approved for use in South Korea.[14]  This article about COVID-19 vaccines is a stub.
