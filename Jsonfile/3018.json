One of the most important performances, after releasing the album include: \"The Power of Love\" at the Juno Awards of 1994 and American Music Awards of 1995, \"Think Twice\" at the Edison Awards in 1994 and World Music Awards in 1995, and \"The Colour of My Love\" at the Juno Awards of 1995. Dion also performed three songs form The Colour of My Love on Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom: \"The Power of Love\" (1994), \"Think Twice\" (1995) and \"Only One Road\" (1995). Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, with positive attention given to Dion's vocals. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it three out of five stars and wrote that the album follows the same pattern as Dion's eponymous breakthrough, and while the songs are not quite as consistent this time around, the record is nevertheless quite successful, thanks to the careful production, professional songwriting (highlighted by \"When I Fall in Love\", \"The Power of Love\", and \"Think Twice\") and Dion's powerhouse performances.[18] Brad Webber from Chicago Tribune gave the album two out of four stars.[19] He felt that \"sickly sweet, by-the-books standards\" like \"The Power of Love\" belie Dion's talent: \"forcefully resonant and multiflavored vocals\".[19] He criticized \"crooked roots\" of a Janet Jackson impersonation (\"Misled\" and \"Think Twice\"), formulaic duo ballad (\"When I Fall in Love\") and added that with Dion's attempt at soul, you can categorize her as \"fairly shallow, sort of a female Michael Bolton\".[19] However Webber praised an \"exotic thrill\" in \"Refuse to Dance\", which \"throws a little variety in the mix\".[19] According to Billboard, The Colour of My Love is a \"big-league affair\" that should push Dion to \"new realms of pop stardom\".[13] Dion is more mature and shows off her vocal prowess on probable smashes as \"The Power of Love\", \"Misled\" and \"Only One Road\".[13] According to Larry Flick from Billboard, although The Colour of My Love is full of the \"grand pop balladry\", it also has more rhythmic depth than Dion's previous projects, including jack-swinging \"Misled\" and the \"haunting but spine-crawling\" \"Refuse to Dance\".[14] The Colour of My Love remains one of the world's best-selling albums of all time.
