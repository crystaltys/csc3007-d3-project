{"Content: ":"The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station (Ukrainian: Запорізька атомна електростанція, romanized: Zaporizʹka atomna elektrostantsiya[1]) in southeastern Ukraine is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and among the 10 largest in the world. It was built by the Soviet Union near the city of Enerhodar, on the southern shore of the Kakhovka Reservoir on the Dnieper river. It is operated by Energoatom, who also operate Ukraine's other three nuclear power stations. The plant has 6 VVER-1000 pressurized light water nuclear reactors (PWR), each fuelled with 235U (LEU)[2] and generating 950 MWe, for a total power output of 5,700 MWe.[3] The first five were successively brought online between 1985 and 1989, and the sixth was added in 1995. The plant generates nearly half of the country's electricity derived from nuclear power,[4] and more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine.[5] The Zaporizhzhia thermal power station is nearby. On 4 March 2022, both plants were captured by Russian forces during the Battle of Enerhodar of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[6][7][8][9] As of 12 March 2022[update] the plant is reportedly controlled by the Russian company Rosatom.[10] In 2017 modernization work was completed on unit 3, enabling a 10 year life-extension to 2027.[4] In 2021 modernization work was completed on unit 5, enabling a 10 year life-extension.[11] In May 2014, 40 armed members claiming to be representatives of Right Sector allegedly tried to gain access to the power plant area.[12] The men were stopped by the Ukrainian police before entering into Enerhodar. The Zaporizhzhia power plant is located around 200 km away from the War in Donbas combat zone, where fighting became very severe in 2014. On 31 August 2014, a Greenpeace member, Tobias Münchmeyer, expressed concerns the plant could be hit by heavy artillery from the fighting. On 3 December 2014, Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk announced the occurrence of an incident several days before at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[13] The cause of the incident was reported as a short circuit in the power outlet system and was not linked to the site's production.[14] One of the six reactors of the plant was shut down twice in December 2014.[15] This and lack of coal for Ukraine's coal-fired power stations led to rolling blackouts throughout the country from early until late December 2014.[15] After the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, Energoatom shut down Units 5 and 6 to reduce risk, keeping Units 1 to 4 in operation on 25 February 2022.[16] At 11:28pm local time on 3 March 2022, a column of 10 Russian armored vehicles and two tanks approached the power plant.[17][18] Fighting commenced at 12:48am on 4 March when Ukraine forces fired anti-tank missiles. Russian forces responded with a variety of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades.[17] During approximately two hours of heavy combat, a fire broke out in a training facility outside the main complex, which was extinguished by 6:20am,[19][20][21] though other sections surrounding the plant sustained damage.[17][22] The fire did not impact reactor safety or any essential equipment.[22][23][21] The plant lost 1.3 GW of capacity.[24] Ukrayinska Pravda reported on 12 March that the plant's management was told by Russian authorities that the plant now belonged to Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear power company.[10] It continues to operate and supply data, including from a remote monitoring system, to the IAEA.[25] On 5 July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Russian forces arranged a military base in the complex by deploying heavy self-propelled multiple rocket launcher BM-30 Smerch.[26] On 19 July 2022, three Ukrainian suicide drones attacked Russian equipment and tents at the site. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said that three Russian occupiers were killed and twelve injured.[27] The occupation administration was reported as saying that at least eleven \"employees\" were injured. An occupation official said the reactors were not damaged and it was unlikely they were the target.[28]","Title":"Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15744","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant"}
