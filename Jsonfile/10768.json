The order also required residents of Maine to wear cloth face coverings in public places where physical distancing could not be achieved, such as within retail stores and taking public transportation.[53] The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry closed 10 coastal state parks as overcrowding at those parks made social distancing difficult. The Department said it would monitor the remaining state parks, most of which were still closed for the winter though walk-ins are permitted.[55] Baxter State Park, a park independent of the state park system, announced it would close until at least July 1, only permitting walk-in day hikes.[56] Acadia National Park announced it would close indefinitely to prevent first responders from being exposed to the virus in the event of an injury and to prevent travel by visitors to the area.[57] On May 6, 2020, Gov. Mills announced that she would create an Economic Recovery Committee to develop recommendations to help address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Maine's economy.[58][59] The committee consists of thirty-seven members, and is co-chaired by Laurie Lachance, President of Thomas College and former Maine State Economist, and Josh Broder, the CEO of Tilson.[58] Other committee members are individuals representing small businesses, non-profit organizations, unions, educational institutions, and legislators.[58] As part of Stage 1 of the Restarting Maine's Economy Plan, Maine government allows for golf courses, barber shops, hair salons, dog groomers, car washes, and auto dealerships to reopen with strict social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines as of May 1, 2020.[60] As part of Stage 2 of the Restarting Maine's Economy plan, Gov.

order issued by Gov. Mills, traffic on state roads had declined by double digits. This was the case especially in urban areas, though MDOT did not release specific figures as they were incomplete.[116] MaineDOT has been able to schedule more daytime road work due to the reduced traffic caused by the pandemic, which means expensive night work is not necessary, saving costs. Such projects include maintenance on several Portland-area bridges on Interstate 295, which can now occur at daytime due to a 60 percent traffic reduction from normal levels.[117] The Maine Turnpike Authority said it was paying all of its employees two weeks of administrative leave, and workers who continued to report to work would still be given it, effectively doubling their pay.
