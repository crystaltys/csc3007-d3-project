{"Content: ":"Michel Schneider (28 May 1944 \u2013 21 July 2022)[1] was a French writer, musicologist, énarque, senior official, and psychoanalyst. He was the father of journalist and writer Vanessa Schneider and the maternal uncle of actress Maria Schneider. A former student of the École nationale d'administration, he began his career at the Department of Forecasting of the French Ministry of Economy and Finance in 1971. He was appointed adviser to the Court of Audit in 1981. He was at the head of the Direction de la Musique, de la Danse, du Théâtre et des Spectacles [fr] in the Ministry of Culture from 1988 to 1991. Michel Schneider died in Villejuif on 21 July 2022 at the age of 78. He obtained ten votes in the election at the Académie Française on February 7, 2008 where he applied to the succession of Bertrand Poirot-Delpech. After the Civil solidarity pact, marriage is only a step towards gay parenting. I am opposed to it. The State, which gives symbolism its force of constraint and benchmark for society - and not vice versa - should not allow marriage and filiation between two persons of the same sex. If human sexuality is not simply \"natural\", it is not entirely cultural, free from the laws of reproduction.[2] There is, in the position of having children without having to relate to the male sex, a fear, a hatred, a fear, a phobia of the virile member, which makes one try to have the product of mating without having to go through the act of mating. There is a fantasy, one wants to say \"Ladies, if you want to have children, there is a very simple, very economic way, which costs nothing to anyone, it is the sexual intercourse with a man in flesh and blood\". Why do you need ART? Why do you want to be a mother when you have chosen a mode of sexuality that forbids it?[3] In the magazine LGBT Yagg [fr],[4] these words have been described as \"homophobic, transphobic and misogynistic\" as well as \"psychoanalytic-reactionary considerations\" by Maëlle Le Corre.","Title":"Michel Schneider - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17121","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Schneider"}
