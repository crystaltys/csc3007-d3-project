{"Content: ":"Caroline Elizabeth Polachek[1] (born June 20, 1985) is an American singer and songwriter. Raised in Connecticut, Polachek co-founded the indie pop band Chairlift while studying at the University of Colorado. The duo emerged from the late-2000s Brooklyn music scene with the sleeper hit \"Bruises.\u201d During her time in the band, she worked on the solo projects Ramona Lisa and CEP before embarking on a career under her own name after Chairlift's disbandment in 2017. Her debut studio album, Pang (2019), featured collaborations with producer Danny L Harle and was released to critical acclaim. Polachek has worked extensively with other artists, collaborating with Blood Orange, Fischerspooner, Sbtrkt, Charli XCX, and the British music collective PC Music, as well as penning material for Beyoncé (\"No Angel\") and Travis Scott. Polachek was born in Manhattan, New York City on June 20, 1985[2] to James Montel Polachek (1944-2020), a financial markets analyst and trained classical musician, and Elizabeth Allan.[3][4] Her great-grandfather Arthur Polachek was a Jewish confectioner from the Slovak village Lastomír.[5][6] Her family relocated to Tokyo, Japan, where she lived between the ages of one and six,[7] and later settled in Greenwich, Connecticut, where Polachek started singing choir in the third grade.[8] She was a synth player from a young age as her father gifted her a Yamaha keyboard to dissuade her from being disruptive on the piano.[9][8] Her parents divorced in 1994.[4] Polachek recounts her early exposure to traditional Japanese songs and anime themes as being influential on her musical education: \"[Japanese singing] [is] a lot of minor and pentatonic [tonality], with really angular melodies that I think really stuck in my subconscious.\"[7] She rode horses growing up: \"I learned a lot about rhythm and about voice from that. Like, you don't always have full control of your instrument. You have to trust it, you have to give it space, you have to know when to push, give it air.\"[10][8] When Polachek was a \"hyperactive kid,\u201d her divorced parents would play Enya at their houses in order to calm her senses.[11] As a teenager, Polachek began traveling to New York to attend concerts, which were a mix of post-hardcore emo, DIY punk and jazz shows.[7] Mike Patton once personally walked her into a show at the Knitting Factory when her fake ID was rejected.[7] She played in a couple of bands in high school and college.[7] Polachek founded the band Chairlift with musician Aaron Pfenning after the pair met during her sophomore year at the University of Colorado. They relocated to New York, where Polachek studied art at New York University, and were joined by Patrick Wimberly in early 2007, the year the band released their first EP titled Daylight Savings, followed by their debut album Does You Inspire You. Polachek and Wimberly went on as a duo to write and produce their 2012 full-length record Something alongside producers Dan Carey and Alan Moulder.

We went on to make what we call a 'sgin' (anagram of the word 'sing')\u2014an original song written specifically to synch into someone else's video on mute\".[13] The same year, she also recorded a duet with Violens, \"Violent Sensation Descends (French Duet Version)\".[14] She later shot and directed the music video for the band's song \"It Couldn't Be Perceived\" in 2011.[15] She collaborated with Elbrecht again on the EP Gloss Coma 001 in 2013,[16] which includes the single \"I.V. Aided Dreams\".[17] In 2012, Polachek featured on the song \"Everything Is Spoilt by Use\" by Ice Choir, a solo project by Kurt Feldman of the Pains of Being Pure at Heart;[18] she also directed and edited the song's music video.[19] Polachek collaborated with Blood Orange on the tracks \"Chamakay\" in 2013[20] and \"Holy Will\" in 2018.[21] In 2013, she co-wrote and co-produced \"No Angel\", which was featured on Beyoncé's critically acclaimed fifth studio album Beyoncé.[22] Due to her production and engineering work on the song, Beyoncé's nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 57th ceremony included Polachek.[23] Polachek began performing sets under the moniker Ramona Lisa in 2013.[24] The name originates from a former pseudonym Polachek used on Facebook.[25] She announced her debut self-produced album as Ramona Lisa, entitled Arcadia, in February 2014.[24][26] Polachek described the album as \"pastoral electronic music\".[27][28][29] Polachek began writing the album during an artistic residency at the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy.[30] In an interview with Pitchfork, she described how her time in Rome inspired the sounds of Arcadia, stating: \"When I was looking out the window in Rome, I wanted this type of electronic music to feel as organic as what I was seeing. I don't think any of the tools that I'm using are particularly new\u2014a lot of the MIDI instruments have been around for 15 years\u2014but the compositions make them sound less electronic, more mysterious.\"[30] The record was made entirely on Polachek's laptop without instruments or external microphones, except to capture field recordings of the sounds she heard in her surroundings.[31] She sang vocals directly into her computer's built in microphone, making use of hotel closets, quiet airport gates, and spare dressing rooms during Chairlift's world tour.[30] The album artwork was shot by New York photographer Tim Barber.[25] In early 2014, Polachek composed and produced instrumental scores for designers Proenza Schouler and Tess Giberson to be featured on runways and promotional videos.[32] In April 2014, Polachek scored a live performance piece by artists India Menuez and Hayden Dunham at SIGNAL gallery in Brooklyn.[33] In October 2014, Polachek scored \"HappyOkay\", a ballet performance video directed by Elena Parasco and produced by House of Makers and Last Hour.

She followed up with a statement on Twitter saying \"This speaks not to the artists or their music, but to the politics of the festival and self-congratulatory PR. To do this without permission from the artists on display is exploitative and unprofessional\", adding \"Moogfest, and all other festivals, simply have a responsibility to position inclusivity as normal\".[38] Polachek featured on Danny L Harle's single \"Ashes of Love\" in 2016.[39] In 2017, she appeared on two songs from Charli XCX's mixtape Pop 2: as a featured artist on \"Tears\" and as a backing vocalist on \"Delicious\", the latter of which features Tommy Cash.[40] In 2018, Polachek featured on Felicita's version of the traditional Polish song \"Był sobie król\", released on their debut album Hej! under the title \"Marzipan\".[41] In June 2019, Polachek released her debut single under her full name titled \"Door\".

In a question from Interview about her earliest musician influence she responds with, \"Probably Enya. My parents got divorced when I was really young and I was a very hyperactive kid, so both parents independently would play Enya at the house to calm me down and soothe me as a kid.\"[63] Polachek's 2015 marriage to artist Ian Drennan was extensively photographed by Vogue magazine.[64][65] They divorced in 2017.[3][66][67] In 2020, Polachek's father died from Covid-19.[3]","Title":"Caroline Polachek - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3170","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Polachek"}
