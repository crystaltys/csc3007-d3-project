The competition was founded in 1966, by the German Basketball Federation. The first final of the German Basketball Cup took place on 11 June 1967, in Oberhausen. Since 1993, the cup championship is decided in a final four format, which is held over one weekend. The host team of the cup's final four, is automatically set as one of the participants. The three remaining teams are determined by three quarterfinal matches, played between the winners of the earlier round matches. Starting from the 2018\u201319 season, the format was changed to a sixteen team knock-out tournament, with the sixteen highest seeded teams from the previous season qualifying.[2] From 1993 to 2019, a final four tournament was held in a host city to determine the winner of the BBL-Pokal. In 2020 on, a knockout tournament was held to determine the winner of the BBL-Pokal.","Title":"BBL-Pokal - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6994","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Basketball_Cup"}
