Whitmer issued a second order on March 20 which \"focuses enforcement resources on the cases most pertinent to the emergency by clarifying which price increases constitute price gouging.\"[277] As of April 14, 3,541 complaints have been received.[278] On March 20, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order banning landlords from filing eviction requests against tenants until April 17, which she says \"relieves courts from certain statutory restrictions to enable them to stay eviction-related proceedings until after the COVID-19 emergency has passed\".[279] Also on that date, Whitmer signed an executive order for medical and dental facilities to postpone any \"non-essential\" procedures, such as plastic surgery and teeth whitening, beginning March 20 through the time the State of Emergency is lifted.[280] On March 21, Whitmer issued an executive order to close facilities that provide non-essential personal care services such as hair and nail salons, tanning salons, spas, and businesses that offer massages, tattoos, body art, and piercings, until April 13.[281] On March 30, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order banning non-essential veterinary visits.[282] On May 18, Governor Whitmer issued two executive orders, one prohibiting factories from giving tours[283] and another requiring people to cover their faces in indoor public spaces.[284] The former requirement was waived to allow President Trump to visit a Ford manufacturing plant in Ypsilanti on May 21. While touring the plant (which was producing ventilators and personal protective equipment), Trump had a mask with the presidential seal but did not wear it on camera, saying he \"didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\" Michigan's attorney general Dana Nessel said she expected to \"have a very serious conversation with Ford\" for enabling the violation of the face-covering requirement, adding the president had sent \"the worst possible message\" and that he would no longer be welcome to tour facilities in the state.[285] Governor Whitmer also signed an executive order on March 21 allowing gatherings of 10 people or less at retail stores by appointment only.[286] Some malls opened as early as March 28 and some automobile showrooms reopened after the executive order was made.[287][288] Tribal casinos plan to reopen on May 29.[289] After the flooding in Midland due to two dams breaking on May 20 forcing mass evacuations, Senator Jim Stamas asks Governor Whitmer to reopen restaurants in the area.[290][291] On June 11, Governor Whitmer extended the freeze on residential evictions for non-payment of rent to June 30.[292] According to the Executive Order signed by Governor Whitmer, on June 10, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Northern Michigan and on June 15 personal care services will reopen.[293] On August 21, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA) cited six businesses with coronavirus health and safety violations, including lack of health screenings, face coverings, employee training, cleaning measures, and overall preparedness plans. Each faces a $7,000 fine.[294] On September 17, another 19 businesses were fined by MIOSHA for \"serious violations\" of COVID-19 safety protocols.[295] On October 2, it was announced ten more business were cited for violating COVID-19 safety guidelines.[296] On November 25, it was announced three bars have had their licenses suspending for violating the MDHHS's latest emergency order, and four other businesses have faced fines.[297] Five more had theirs suspended on December 29.[298] On February 5, it was reported 20 business across the state were fined for COVID-19 violations.[299] Another 16 businesses were charged on February 19.[300] With the latest batch of violations, the state's Attorney General has now charged over 100 separate businesses.[301] On April 9, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced 12 more businesses were fined for violations.[302] On April 19, it was reported 25 more businesses were cited, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan which required union employees to work from the office, but allowed nonunion employees doing similar jobs to work from home.[303] On March 17, the Michigan Legislature approved $125 million to fight the pandemic, with $50 million going towards the Department of Health and Human Services and another $40 million towards other state agencies for ongoing coronavirus response needs. Another $35 million was set in reserve in case more funding becomes necessary in the future.[244] On March 18, Governor Whitmer asked the Michigan Army National Guard to \"assist the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services with assembling and loading critical personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, and face shields.\"[245] In response to widespread rumors that were circulating regarding the National Guard's presence in the state, Whitmer reaffirmed on March 20 that there were no active plans to implement martial law, although she did indicate that state officials were monitoring the effectiveness of lock-down protocols in other states, should they become necessary.[304] On March 30, the legislature allocated an additional $150 million to purchase supplies to fight the pandemic.[246] President Donald Trump approved Governor Whitmer's disaster declaration on March 28.[305] Michigan will get about $2 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) signed into law on March 27.[306] On August 5, it was announced small businesses in Michigan will receive a combined total of $5.7 million from the CARES Act.[307] Michigan will receive $65 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, 2021.[308] A total of $622 million of federal money for rental assistance will become available to eligible Michigan residents starting the third week of March 2021. Some of it, $282 million, will be distributed immediately, and the other $340 million will be appropriated by the state legislature at a later date.[309] On March 23, Governor Whitmer issued a statewide stay-at-home order, starting March 24, and lasting for at least three weeks, until April 13.[14] On April 15, Governor Whitmer ordered nursing homes to transfer coronavirus patients to separate units or special facilities and banned evictions from nursing homes. The order was in effect until May 13.[310] On April 16, Governor Whitmer joined the governors of Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky to coordinate a plan to reopen the Midwest regional economy.[311] On April 17, Governor Whitmer outlined a plan to re-open the state's economy starting May 1.[312] The stay-at-home order was extended to April 30,[313] and then re-extended until May 15, and once more until May 30 with modified restrictions compared to previous orders.[29][241][34][30] \"Stay Home, Stay Safe\", Executive Order 2020\u201321 directed all businesses and operations to temporarily suspend in-person services that are not necessary to sustain or protect life. The order directed residents to remain \"in their homes unless they\u2019re a part of an essential workforce, engaged in an outdoor activity, or performing tasks necessary to the health and safety of themselves or their family, like going to the hospital, or grocery store.\" When leaving the house, individuals must adhere to social distancing measures, as directed by the CDC.[14] The next stay-at-home order, Executive Order 2020\u201342, signed April 9, closed golf courses, disallowed recreational boating and travel to vacation homes in the state, and banned customers from shopping in non-essential sections of retail stores and businesses, including carpeting, flooring, furniture, garden centers, plant nurseries or paint.[25][26][27][28] Failure to abide by the order could have resulted in a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail.[314] The stay-at-home order was later extended to May 15, with some restrictions from the second one lifted and others added. The controversial bans of recreational boating and travel to vacation homes were removed, while non-medical grade face coverings in public became mandatory starting April 26. Several businesses and sections of stores were allowed to reopen, including those gardening supplies and paint, as well as golf courses, but Airbnb rentals were banned.[29] The next stay-at-home order modified some of the restrictions from previous orders and allowed manufacturing to restart on May 11.[35] On April 27, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order placing several new regulations on restaurant and grocery stores and their employees.[315] On May 18, Governor Whitmer announced bars and restaurant dining rooms in the Northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula would be allowed to open on May 22.[316] She later announced retail stores and auto dealerships may reopen on May 26 and nonessential medical, dental, and veterinary procedures may begin on May 29.[248] On May 22, Governor Whitmer extended the stay-at-home order until June 12 and the state of emergency until June 19.[36] On June 1, Governor Whitmer lifted the stay-at-home order, and also announced that restaurants and bars would be allowed to reopen statewide on June 8.[317] On July 14, Governor Whitmer extended the state of emergency again until August 11.[318] A month later Whitmer issued a new order to expire September 4.[41] A later emergency order expired October 27.[57] Facing a COVID-19 surge in the state in April, Governor Whitmer hoped to avoid more mandatory shutdowns and asked Michigan residents on April 9 to take more \"personal responsibility,\" while asking the White House to send more vaccine doses.[319][320] The request for vaccines was denied, in large part because the protection provided by vaccines activates only after several weeks while the need to prevent new infections was immediate.[321] On April 12, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky argued that asking for voluntary quarantine would not be enough. She said that Michigan needed \"to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to go back to where we were last spring, last summer, and to shut things down.\"[322][323] During the week of March 16, 2020, Michigan Medicine started in-house testing for COVID-19, with the capabilities to deliver same-day results. This allowed the hospital to bypass the state's testing system, which was previously the sole provider of testing for the virus. The same week, the health system also launched drive-thru testing services for Michigan Medicine patients at West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Health Center, and Canton Health Center.[324] Similarly, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit also developed in-house testing methods in an effort to increase overall testing capacity within the state.[324] On March 27, 2020, a regional drive-up testing center opened in Detroit, at the vacant State Fairgrounds site. A partnership between Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, the city of Detroit, and three regional health systems, the center is able to test up to 400 residents a day, who are referred to the site from their doctor via scheduled appointments.[325] The state restructured reporting procedures and began incorporating private test results in official government case tallies on March 19, 2020.[326] On April 15, 2020, Hurley Medical Center in Flint opened a mobile testing clinic at Atwood Stadium, with capacity for at least 250 people per day. Testing is provided to those with orders from a doctor and is not open to the general public.[327] Similar drive-thru testing facilities opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Battle Creek, Bay City, Benton Harbor, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Saginaw, and Traverse City.[328][329] The state health department released case counts and death tolls daily and updated recovered cases weekly. Reviews of the outcomes of reported COVID cases led to the discovery of unrecorded deaths on multiple occasions. These deaths were added to the daily toll when discovered, with the result that daily reported deaths did not always indicate the current state of the epidemic. Recovery from the disease was defined simply as surviving 30 days after first symptoms, with no review of actual health or hospitalization status.[330] Starting May 29, 2020, families could get tested together in Kalamazoo.[331] Starting April 13, 2020, new testing sites opened in Atlanta, Bad Axe, Bay City, Battle Creek, Benton Harbor, Detroit, Flint, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City.[332] Michigan airports received a combined $256 million in federal aid to help ease economic hardship from the coronavirus crisis, funded by the CARES Act.[333] Starting March 13, 2020, Delta Air Lines, which has a major hub at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said it would cancel all flights to Europe for 30 days, decreasing flights by 40% and grounding 300 planes.[334] Delta had previously indicated it would reduce international flights by 20\u201325% and domestic flights by 10\u201315%.[335] On April 28, Delta announced it was suspending flights to and from Flint, Lansing, and Kalamazoo and several other small hub airports across the country after losing $534 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic.[336] American Airlines ended service to 15 small airports, including Kalamazoo, starting October 7.[337] Starting on March 15, 2020, several grocery chains that have stores in Michigan, including Kroger, Meijer, and Walmart, began reducing their business hours for cleaning and restocking in response to the pandemic.[338][339][340] Similarly, Michigan-based Meijer reported a plan to hire 40\u201350 new seasonal employees per store to help meet public demand during the outbreak.[341] Kroger announced that, starting the morning of March 23, all of its Michigan stores would be dedicating the first hour of business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to seniors, expectant mothers, first responders, and those with compromised immune systems.[342] The following week, Kroger announced it would hire up to 2,000 people in Michigan in response to the pandemic.[343] The 2020 North American International Auto Show in Detroit was canceled on March 29, due to the use of its venue TCF Center as a FEMA facility.[344] Michigan-based automotive manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to gradually shut down plants starting March 19 with all plants closed by the end of the month.[345] On March 30, Ford announced it will convert its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti to produce GE/Airon Corporation Model A-E ventilators. It says it will produce 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days.[346] On April 1, 2020, General Motors announced it will produce 30,000 V+Pro critical care ventilators for the national stockpile.[347] On the morning of March 16, Governor Whitmer announced a temporary order to close all bars and restaurants in the state to sit-down service, effective at 3 pm the same evening until March 30. Carry-out and delivery options were excluded from the order, although restaurants were urged to limit in-building carry-out services to five customers at a time. The order also included fitness centers, theaters, casinos, and other venues that encourage large assemblages of patrons, with several exceptions, such as office buildings.[240][348] This order is expected to have significant economic impacts on businesses, and it prompted the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association to call for Whitmer to submit paperwork to qualify Michigan for the U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.[348] The order also expands unemployment benefits to public health workers who become ill, people who need to take time off to care for children, and others, until April 14.[349] Domino's Pizza, which is centered in the state, anticipated hiring up to 10,000 people to help meet increased demand for food delivery services due to the pandemic,[350] while Jet's Pizza also prepared to hire \"hundreds\" of additional delivery drivers for the same reason.[351] On June 8, Lansing restaurants reopened for dine-in service for the first time since mid-May.[352] On September 21, it was announced three bars in West Michigan lost their liquor licenses temporarily after they allegedly failed to enforce coronavirus mandates.[353] On January 22, 2021, at Governor Whitmer announced that starting on February 1, restaurants may re-open at 25% capacity with up to 100 people, tables must be six feet apart with no more than six people per table, and bars and restaurants must close by 10 p.m. Contact information must also be collected from people for contact tracing purposes.[89] Since December 1, 21 restaurants have received COVID-19 order violations by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Six restaurants had their food license suspended \u2013 and five of the six suspensions are still in place. Another 15 businesses were sent cease-and-desist orders, which is a lesser violation.[354] Restaurants, bars and retail stores were allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting March 5, 2021.[94] On March 19, the owner of a pizza restaurant in Holland was criminally charged with allowing indoor dining when it was banned, not enforcing mask rules, and ignoring capacity limits.[355] On March 19, the Michigan Strategic Fund unanimously voted to approve a $20 million economic relief program meant to help struggling small businesses affected by the pandemic.[356] The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) had processed over 1.7 million applications as of May 13, with 1.375 million people receiving benefits. The state has paid $5.62 billion in benefits since the state of emergency was declared two months prior.[357] By June 19, UIA disbursed $11.4 billion to two million people since the coronavirus pandemic reached the state.[358] On August 21, the Federal Emergency Management Administration approved UIA's application for funding that would provide an additional $300 per week payment to Michigan residents receiving unemployment benefits.[359] On October 14, the federal government approved unemployment benefits for 20 more weeks, with up to 59 weeks of benefits for some workers.[360] On October 20, Governor Whitmer signed a bill approving six more weeks of state unemployment aid.[361] On March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training. Four days later, they announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, which affected Michigan's team, the Detroit Tigers.[362] On June 24, two members of the Detroit Tigers organization (later identified as pitcher Daniel Norris and a coach) tested positive for COVID-19.[162] Norris was later cleared to join the Opening Day roster.[163] On June 25, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order which allows professional sports to resume in the state.[363] Two days before, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps at their regular season home stadiums on July 1 in order to resume spring training, which included inter-squad games only, and prepare for a July 23 or 24 Opening Day (July 24 for the Tigers).[364] In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, teams only played their own division and the opposite league's corresponding geographical division, e.g. the Tigers only played the American League Central (40 games total) and National League Central (20 games total).[365] Games were played behind closed doors, with artificial crowd noise played over loudspeakers.[366] The Tigers' August 3\u20136 series against the St. Louis Cardinals was postponed several times after 17 of the latter's members tested positive for COVID-19, with two of the games later cancelled outright.[367] On March 15, 2021, Governor Whitmer increased the maximum allowed capacity of sports stadiums from 375 people to 1,000, in time for the start of the 2021 Detroit Tigers season.[96] On June 8, Comerica Park was allowed to return to operating at full seating capacity after April and May games this season were limited to 8,000 fans.[368] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, which affected the Detroit Pistons.[369] On March 14, Detroit Pistons power forward Christian Wood reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.[134] The Pistons' season officially ended on June 5 when they failed to make the cut for a 22-team restart.[370] In their 2020\u201321 season, the Pistons' game against the Denver Nuggets on February 1 was postponed due to a positive test on a Detroit player, as well as the February 16 game against the San Antonio Spurs due to an outbreak on the latter team.[371][372] In the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time starting March 12, which affected the Detroit Red Wings.[373] The Red Wings' season officially ended on May 27 when they failed to make a 24-team playoff tournament.[374] The NHL's shortened 2020\u201321 season began on January 13.

All spring 2020 seasons were canceled as well.[397] On June 1, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order that allows college teams to begin workouts and practice sessions for fall 2020 sports seasons. It allows \"outdoor fitness classes, athletic practices, training sessions or games, provided that coaches, spectators and participants not from the same household maintain six feet of distance from one another at all times\".[398] On August 8, the Mid-American Conference (MAC), which includes the Central Michigan Chippewas, Eastern Michigan Eagles, and Western Michigan Broncos, canceled all of its fall 2020 sports seasons.[42] On September 25, the MAC reversed its previous decision on its 2020 football season, voting to play a six\u2013game schedule which started on November 4.[43] On August 11, the Big Ten Conference, which includes the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans, postponed their fall 2020 sports seasons.[44] On September 16, however, it was announced the 2020 football season would start on October 24 with an eight-game schedule.[399] On August 12, the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which is made up mostly of schools in Michigan, postponed its fall 2020 and winter 2021 sports seasons.[45] In the fall of 2020, the pandemic caused both the Michigan Wolverines football and Michigan State Spartans football teams to cancel their games against the Maryland Terrapins football team due to COVID-19 outbreaks.[210][208][209] The Michigan football team's game against their arch-rival, the Ohio State Buckeyes, as well as their game against the Iowa Hawkeyes, were also canceled after an increasing number of Michigan players and staff members became infected.[400][210][211] On January 23, 2021, the University of Michigan (U of M) shut down all sports for two weeks after the new more infectious UK variant of COVID-19 was discovered in five individuals with ties to the school.[217][206] As of April 23, 2021, 342 U of M student-athletes and 59 coaches and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19.[401] At the high school level, the Michigan High School Athletic Association canceled the remainder of the winter 2019\u201320 seasons and all of the spring 2020 seasons on April 3, 2020.[402] On July 17, MHSAA announced all fall sports will resume as scheduled for the 2020\u201321 school year with practices starting August 10 for football and August 12 for other sports.[403] However, on July 30, they announced all preseason scrimmages would be canceled and medium and high-risk sports (soccer, volleyball and football) could start practice but a final decision on whether games would be allowed might not be made until August 20.[404] The MHSAA postponed the football season until spring 2021.[47] On August 20, the MHSAA announced it will be allowing soccer, volleyball and swimming to start fall competition in Michigan's region 6 and 8 in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Regions 1-5 and 7 are still pending due to the phases they are in according to the Governor's executive orders on the pandemic. Girls' golf, boys' tennis and cross country in both peninsulas are able to start immediately because they are not contact sports.[405] On September 3, the MHSAA approved the return of all fall 2020 sports.[406] On November 15, Governor Whitmer announced the MDHHS has ordered all high school sports to suspend activities for three weeks, effective November 18.[67] On April 15, a convoy of thousands of motorists drove from all over the state to protest the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order.[407] The protest, known now as Operation Gridlock, involved clogging the streets surrounding on near the Michigan State Capitol, including the Capitol Loop, with their vehicles, drawing national attention.[408] The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group with ties to the DeVos family, through Facebook.[409] The Michigan Freedom Fund supported the rally by as an event co-host, spending an estimated $250 to promote the event.[410] The Michigan Conservative Coalition is asking the governor to take a more measured approach that would allow certain parts of work and daily life to start returning to normal.[411] The organizers urged participants to practice social distancing, and not leave their vehicles during the protest. Lt. Darren Green of the Michigan State Police estimated several thousand cars were part of the demonstration, with 100 to 150 people congregating on the Capitol lawn. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a pretty good job of maintaining social distance,\" Green said. \"They\u2019re being respectful and not causing any issues at all.\u201d Neither the Michigan State Police nor the Lansing Police Department had reported any arrests.[412] Multiple services have been disrupted as a result of Operation Gridlock, such as the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) temporarily suspending their downtown route.[413] Governor Whitmer said the protest was legal per the First Amendment's right to freedom of assembly, and understood the protesters' anger, but warned them they were endangering their health by not following social distancing guidelines and noticed some people were not wearing personal protective equipment, including children, further adding \"(It's) not a political decision, it's about public health. The enemy is the virus, not one another.\"[414][408] President Donald Trump supported the protest on April 17 with an all-caps tweet saying \"Liberate Michigan\".[415] On April 30, a second protest occurred when hundreds of protesters, many carrying firearms, gathered at the Michigan Capitol. Many protesters were able to enter the building. The demonstration was organized by conservative group Michigan United for Liberty.[416] Governor Whitmer said on April 30 that she found elements of the protest \u2018disturbing.\u2019 Also, in an appearance May 3 on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, the governor said the Confederate flags, nooses and Nazi signs displayed were \u2018outrageous\u2019 and racist, with some depicting her as Adolf Hitler.[417] On May 14, more armed protesters from Michigan United for Liberty gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol.[418] The organization's Facebook group was deleted over death threats against Governor Whitmer and a fight broke out over a doll tied to a noose carried by a man who also had an axe at the protest.[419] The Michigan Legislature closed its scheduled session to avoid the possibility of another armed confrontation inside the chamber. On May 20, the Michigan Conservative Coalition held \"Operation Haircut\" on the lawn of the Capitol Building, in which barbers gave free haircuts, in support of an Owosso barber who was forced to shut down after continuing to operate until the previous week, violating the executive order closing non-essential businesses that included barbershops and beauty salons resulting in the state suspending his license. Several of the barbers at the demonstration were issued $1,000 citations by the Michigan State Police for disorderly conduct.[420] A week later on May 27, the group from Operation Haircut delivered a letter to the Governor with a layout of safe practices to reopen.[421] The charges against the Owosso barber were eventually dismissed.[422] The charges against the other barbers arrested during the Operation Haircut demonstration were dismissed on February 8, 2021.[423] A peaceful demonstration of prayers organized by the religious non-profit Transformation Michigan was performed on the Capitol lawn on May 28.[424] A peaceful protest called \"Let MI People Go\" by the religious group Stand Up Michigan took place on the Capitol lawn on October 8.[425] On December 15, a protest took place near the home of Robert Gordon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, to oppose the new restrictions imposed by the state.[426] During the summer and fall of 2020, Governor Whitmer was targeted with an elaborate kidnapping plot. The plot was revealed when the Federal Bureau of Investigation thwarted it. In October 2020, fourteen members of a right-wing militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged with several federal and state crimes. One of the suspects cited Whitmer's handling of the pandemic as part of their motive to kidnap her.[427][428] In April multiple lawsuits were filed challenging Whitmer's executive orders. The suits were filed by individuals, business owners, recreational fishermen, a conservation organization, and several county prosecutors. They alleged that her orders were overly broad, violated their constitutional rights, harmed businesses, and amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property rights.[429][430][431][432][433] Governor Whitmer's third stay-at-home order, issued April 24, overturned the restrictions on recreational boating and visits to vacation homes, effectively ending some of the lawsuits.[434] On April 29, inmates from various Michigan prisons filed a class action lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, claiming the state is violating the Eighth Amendment by subjecting inmates to cruel and unusual punishment by not taking necessary pandemic precautions.[435] On May 6, a group of churches sued Governor Whitmer, claiming \"Executive Order 2020-70 continues to prohibit gatherings of two or more individuals, including at churches, thereby denying them the ability to hold worship services and otherwise carry out their ministry functions until May 28, 2020\" violates their First Amendment right of freedom of religion.[436] On May 22, a group of independently owned gyms and fitness centers sued Governor Whitmer and the state's top health official the in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in Grand Rapids attempting to overturn the state's stay-at-home order and allow them to reopen.[437] Whitmer re-opened gyms and fitness centers on September 9.[438] On May 29, the Department of Justice filed a statement that supports a lawsuit filed by seven Michigan businesses that challenged the restrictions imposed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[439][440] On June 2, Governor Whitmer stated in an opinion piece that the coronavirus is a civil rights battle too and that she was surprised by the lawsuit.[441] On October 21, a chiropractors' office in Grand Haven sued the MDHHS, Whitmer, the Ottawa County Department of Public Health and the county's Deputy Health Administrator in the Michigan Court of Claims, arguing that it did not have the authority to mandate the wearing of face masks. The business had received warnings and a cease-and-desist order from local officials over its non-enforcement of the state mask mandate.[442] On November 17, the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association sued the Michigan Department of Health and Human Service's director to block a ban on dine-in service ordered from November 18 until December 8.[443] On November 20, a federal judge denied the request, but scheduled a hearing on the case for November 30.[444] On December 7, in response to the extension of a partial shutdown order that lasts until December 20, a group of Catholic high schools called the Michigan Association of Non-public Schools sued the state in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan on claims that emergency health orders banning in-school classes and religious training are unconstitutional.[445] On May 6, Michigan House of Representatives Speaker Lee Chatfield and Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, both Republicans, sued Governor Whitmer, who is a Democrat, over her use of emergency powers during the pandemic, saying only the Michigan Legislature has the power to extend the state of emergency.[446] The Michigan Court of Claims ruled in Governor Whitmer's favor on May 21.[447] The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the Court of Claims' ruling on August 21, in a 2\u20131 decision.[448] On October 2, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled on questions posed by District Judge Paul Lewis Maloney over whether Governor Whitmer violated the state Emergency Management Act of 1976, and whether the Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945 was unconstitutional. It was argued that Whitmer bypassed a requirement for a vote by the state legislature in order to extend a state of emergency beyond 28 days, by redeclaring it each time it expired. It was also argued that the Emergency Powers of Governor Act constituted an \"unlawful delegation of legislative power to the executive\". The court unanimously ruled against Whitmer on the former question. The court ruled 4\u20133 against Whitmer on the latter question.[449][450][451] Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey warned that the decision \"does not alter our collective responsibility to protect ourselves and others\", and encouraged \"bipartisan action to transition from government operating in fear of the virus to government managing life in the presence of the virus.\"[449][450] Governor Whitmer argued that the decision was still subject to a 21-day reconsideration period, during which the orders should have still stood. On October 4, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel stated that she would stop enforcing COVID-19-related executive orders.[449] On October 5, Governor Whitmer told CNN the decision \"undermined my emergency rule, my emergency orders that I\u2019ve had to enact that puts us in the same state as all other states in this nation, to save lives. We\u2019ve saved thousands of lives.\"[452] In response to the ruling, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) issued various orders intended to supplant most of Whitmer's executive orders, including requiring bars to close indoor gathering spaces, restrict the size of gatherings, and require the use of face masks in \"social gatherings\", defined as a shared space with two or more people where people are from multiple households. Businesses and government offices are required to enforce the requirements for gatherings on their premises. It also requires mask use in all sports except swimming if social distancing is not being practiced. These orders were enacted under the state health code, which gives the director of the HHS the authority to restrict gatherings and \"establish procedures\" to control an epidemic.[453][454][455] The Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration similarly issued its own set of emergency rules for workplaces on October 14, again supplanting Whitmer's orders.[456] On October 12, the Court denied Whitmer's motion for a transition period, officially voiding all executive orders she had issued.[457][454][455] ","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10775","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Michigan"}
