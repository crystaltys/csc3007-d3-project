{"Content: ":"That Championship Season is a 1999 American made-for-television drama film about four members of a championship high school basketball team, along with their coach, who reunite 20 years later. The film is based on Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. Sorvino assumes the role played by Robert Mitchum in the original film, with D'Onofrio taking over Sorvino's role from that presentation. Phil, James, George, and Tom meet 20 years after their championship high school game at a special reunion at their high school. Afterwards, they decide to visit the home of their old coach. While at first it seems they are all having a few harmless drinks, the night soon takes a violent turn as several things are realized; Phil is having an affair with George's wife, George (who is running for mayor) is firing James, who is his campaign chairman, and Tom has become a reeling drunk. With the help of their old Coach, the men try to put their lives back together\u2014but the Coach proves to be nothing they believed him to have been, and worse than no help; in fact, his involvement with each of the men's lives proves to have done them all much more harm than good. This is particularly glaring because of the refusal of the star player, who still hates the Coach after all these years, to attend the reunion. Charles McNulty of Variety wrote \"That Championship Season may seem like a tame choice to launch New York's first truly postmodern (or is it post-postmodern?) theater building\".[1]  This article related to an American television drama film is a stub.
