{"Content: ":"Sri Lanka, from 3 November 2017 until 11 November 2017, faced a fuel shortage when a substandard fuel shipment was rejected which caused a depletion in reserves due to the general public fearing of a prolonged duration of crisis. However, there was only a shortage of petrol not diesel or kerosene. The Sri Lanka fuel crisis began on 3 November 2017 when rumours started spreading that a fuel shipment belonging to Lanka IOC (Indian Oil Company) was rejected. Later on the rumour was confirmed as legitimate and the reason given was that the fuel in the rejected shipment was not up to standards.[1] Arjuna Ranatunga the Minister of Petroleum Resources Development on the next day addressed the situation to the media. However the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development announced that there was 10,000 metric tonnes fuel in the reserves to last till 9 November 2017 but the leader of the Ceylon Petroleum Union, Asanka Ranawala said the contrary to this.[1] Due to development of the tense situation the general public started panic buying causing the reserves to deplete faster than expected.[2] However the crisis was brought to a stop after the ship Nevaska Lady on 11 November 2017 with 40,000 metric tonnes of fuel which was reported as being sufficient for twenty days.[3] Other than the substandard fuel rejected being the main reason for the crisis there were several other events that worsened the crisis during this time period. Many steps were taken by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development to overcome the problem until any fuel shipments arrived A cabinet sub committee was appointed by the President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena in order to investigate the crisis on the 7 November 2017.[8] According to the report submitted by the committee on 17 November 2017 the main reason for the crisis was the failure to maintain proper fuel stocks according to the average use and another reason was the failure to report the dire situation to higher authorities on time causing the whole situation to go out of hand.[8] However, according to the officials the report is inconclusive and the sub committee has also requested recruiting technical officers to get a more detailed report.[8]","Title":"2017 Sri Lankan fuel crisis - Wikipedia","KeyID":"13217","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Sri_Lankan_fuel_crisis"}
