{"Content: ":"See text Salmonivirus is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Alloherpesviridae. Salmonidae serve as natural hosts. There are three species in this genus. Diseases associated with this genus include: salHV-3: epizootic epitheliotropic disease.[1][2] The genus consists of the following three species:[2] Viruses in Salmonivirus are enveloped, with icosahedral and spherical to pleomorphic geometries, and T=16 symmetry. The diameter is around 150-200 nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented.[1] Viral replication is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. Salmonidae serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are passive diffusion.[1] ","Title":"Salmonivirus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1236","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonivirus"}
