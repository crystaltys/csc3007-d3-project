{"Content: ":"The Kali Yuga, in Hinduism, is the fourth and worst of the four yugas (world ages) in a Yuga Cycle, preceded by Dvapara Yuga and followed by the next cycle's Krita (Satya) Yuga. It is believed to be the present age, which is full of conflict and sin.[1][2][3] The \"Kali\" of Kali Yuga means \"strife\", \"discord\", \"quarrel\", or \"contention\" and Kali Yuga is associated with the demon Kali (not to be confused with the goddess Kālī).[citation needed] According to Puranic sources,[a] Krishna's departure marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE.[9][10] Lasting for 432,000 years (1,200 divine years), Kali Yuga began 5,123 years ago and has 426,877 years left as of 2022 CE.[11][12][13] Kali Yuga will end in the year 428,899 CE.[14][b] Yuga (Sanskrit: युग), in this context, means \"an age of the world\", where its archaic spelling is yug, with other forms of yugam, yugānāṃ, and yuge, derived from yuj (Sanskrit: युज्, lit.\u2009'to join or yoke'), believed derived from *yeug- (Proto-Indo-European: lit. 'to join or unite').[15] Kali Yuga (Sanskrit: कलियुग, romanized: kaliyuga or kali-yuga) means \"the age of Kali (demon)\", \"the age of darkness\", \"the age of vice and misery\", or \"the age of quarrel and hypocrisy\".[16] A complete description of Kali Yuga is found in the Mahabharata, Manusmriti, Vishnu Smriti, and various Puranas.[17] It is used mathematically in the astronomical texts Aryabhatiya and Surya Siddhanta. According to P. V. Kane, one of the earliest inscriptions with one of the four yugas named is the Pikira grant of Pallava Simhavarman (mid-5th century CE):[18][19] Who was ever ready to extricate dharma that had become sunk owing to the evil effects of Kaliyuga. Other epigraphs exist with named yugas in the Old Mysore region of India, published in Epigraphia Carnatica.[20] According to the Surya Siddhanta, Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102 BCE.[9][10][21] This is also considered the date on which Krishna left the earth to return to Vaikuntha.[22] This information is placed at the temple of Bhalka, the place of this incident (see photo). According to the astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata, Kali Yuga started in 3102 BCE. He finished his book Aryabhattiyam in 499 CE, in which he gave the exact year of the beginning of Kali Yuga. He writes that he wrote the book in the \"year 3600 of the Kali Age\" at the age of 23. As it was the 3600th year of the Kali Age when he was 23 years old, and given that Aryabhata was born in 476 CE, the beginning of the Kali Yuga would come to (3600 - (476 + 23) + 1 (One year from 1 BCE to 1 CE)) = 3102 BCE.[23] According to K. D. Abhyankar, the starting point of Kali Yuga is an extremely rare planetary alignment, which is depicted in the Mohenjo-daro seals.[24] Going by this alignment, the year 3102 BCE is slightly off. The actual date for this alignment is 7 February 3104 BCE. There is also sufficient proof to believe that Vrdhha Garga knew of precessions at least by 500 BCE. Garga had calculated the rate of precession to within 30% of what the modern scholars estimate.[25][26][better source needed] Hindu texts describe four yugas (world ages)\u2060 in a Yuga Cycle, where, starting in order from the first age of Krita (Satya) Yuga, each yuga's length decreases by one-fourth (25%), giving proportions of 4:3:2:1. Each yuga is described as having a main period (a.k.a. yuga proper) preceded by its yuga-sandhyā (dawn) and followed by its yuga-sandhyāṃśa (dusk)\u2060, where each twilight (dawn/dusk) lasts for one-tenth (10%) of its main period. Lengths are given in divine years (years of the gods), each lasting for 360 solar (human) years.[11][12][13] Kali Yuga, the fourth age in a cycle, lasts for 432,000 years (1,200 divine years), where its main period lasts for 360,000 years (1,000 divine years) and its two twilights each lasts for 36,000 years (100 divine years). The current cycle's Kali Yuga, the present age, has the following dates based on it starting in 3102 BCE:[11][12][13] Mahabharata, Book 12 (Shanti Parva), Ch. 231:[27][c] (17) A year (of men) is equal to a day and night of the gods ... (19) I shall, in their order, tell you the number of years that are for different purposes calculated differently, in the Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali yugas. (20) Four thousand celestial years is the duration of the first or Krita age. The morning of that cycle consists of four hundred years and its evening is of four hundred years. (21) Regarding the other cycles, the duration of each gradually decreases by a quarter in respect of both the principal period with the minor portion and the conjoining portion itself. Manusmriti, Ch. 1:[28] (67) A year is a day and a night of the gods ... (68) But hear now the brief (description of) the duration of a night and a day of Brahman and of the several ages (of the world, yuga) according to their order. (69) They declare that the Krita age (consists of) four thousand years (of the gods); the twilight preceding it consists of as many hundreds, and the twilight following it of the same number. (70) In the other three ages with their twilights preceding and following, the thousands and hundreds are diminished by one (in each). Surya Siddhanta, Ch. 1:[29] (13) ... twelve months make a year. This is called a day of the gods. (14) ... Six times sixty [360] of them are a year of the gods ... (15) Twelve thousand of these divine years are denominated a Quadruple Age (caturyuga); of ten thousand times four hundred and thirty-two [4,320,000] solar years (16) Is composed that Quadruple Age, with its dawn and twilight. The difference of the Golden and the other Ages, as measured by the difference in the number of the feet of Virtue in each, is as follows : (17) The tenth part of an Age, multiplied successively by four, three, two, and one, gives the length of the Golden and the other Ages, in order : the sixth part of each belongs to its dawn and twilight. Hinduism often symbolically represents morality (dharma) as an Indian bull. In Satya Yuga, the first stage of development, the bull has four legs, which is reduced by one in each age that follows. By the age of Kali, morality is reduced to only a quarter of that of the golden age, so that the bull of Dharma has only one leg.[30][31] The Kurukshetra War and the decimation of Kauravas thus happened at the Yuga-Sandhi, the point of transition from one yuga to another.[32] The scriptures mention Narada as having momentarily intercepted the demon Kali on his way to the Earth when Duryodhana was about to be born in order to make him an embodiment of arishadvargas and adharma in preparation of the era of decay in values and the consequent havoc.[citation needed] A discourse by Markandeya in the Mahabharata identifies some of the attributes of Kali Yuga.[33] The Brahma Vaivarta Purana (related to Rathantara kalpa) mentions a 10,000-year period, starting from the traditional dating of the Kali Yuga epoch, during which bhakti yogis will be present.[34] Guru Granth Sahib on Ang:1185 says:[35] Now, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga has come. Plant the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. It is not the season to plant other seeds. Do not wander lost in doubt and delusion. In the \"Nehkalanki Avatar\" section of Chaubis Avatar, Guru Gobind Singh describes the characteristics of the Kali Yuga before the incarnation of Kalki, the twenty-fourth avatar of Vishnu. The author details various attitudes and actions that he perceives to be adharmic becoming increasingly prevalent among humans, including irreligion and engrossment in kama (sexual pleasure).[36][37] In the \"Bridh Naraaj\" stanza of \"Nehkalanki Avatar\", the author states: ਸੁਧਰਮ ਧਰਮ ਧੋਹਿ ਹੈ ਧ੍ਰਿਤੰ ਧਰਾ ਧਰੇਸਣੰ ॥ ਅਧਰਮ ਧਰਮਣੋ ਧ੍ਰਿਤੰ ਕੁਕਰਮ ਕਰਮਣੋ ਕ੍ਰਿਤੰ ॥੨੭॥ The kings of the earth will do the work of destroying dharma. The life of adharma will be considered authentic, and the bad actions will be considered worth doing.27. - Dasam Granth, 555.[38] The Kali Yuga is an important concept in both Theosophy and Anthroposophy,[39][40] and in the writings of Helena Blavatsky, W.Q. Judge, Rudolf Steiner, Savitri Devi, and Traditionalist philosophers such as René Guénon and Julius Evola, among others. Rudolf Steiner believed that the Kali Yuga ended in 1900.[39] The dictionary definition of Kali Yuga at Wiktionary","Title":"Kali Yuga - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12034","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga"}
