Dua Lipa was born in London,[1] the eldest child of Kosovo Albanian parents Anesa (née Rexha) and Dukagjin Lipa from Pristina, FR Yugoslavia (present-day Kosovo[a]).[2][3] Her family are Muslims.[4] Through her maternal grandmother, she is of Bosnian descent.[5][6][7] Her ancestry can also be traced back to the city of Peja, Kosovo. Both of her grandfathers were historians.[8] She has a sister named Rina and a brother named Gjin Lipa.[9][10][11][12] Lipa was musically influenced by her father,[13][14][15] who was the lead singer and guitarist of the Kosovan rock band Oda.[16][17][12] Her father continued to play music at home, including his own compositions and songs of artists such as David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Sting, the Police and Stereophonics.[14][15][18] Lipa started singing at the age of five.[19] Lipa grew up in West Hampstead, London.[17] She attended Fitzjohn's Primary School,[20][21] where her music lessons included the cello.[3] When she auditioned to enter the school choir, the teacher told her that \"she could not sing\".[3][14][22] At the age of nine, she began weekend singing lessons at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.[3][23][24] Lipa moved with her family to Pristina after Kosovo declared independence in 2008.[23][19] There, she attended Mileniumi i Tretë School,[25] learned more about the Albanian language and considered a musical career.[26][27] Lipa moved back to London at age 15.[28][29] At Parliament Hill School she passed her A-Levels, then re-entered Sylvia Young Theatre School part-time.[29][30] She uploaded her own songs to SoundCloud and YouTube. She began posting videos of herself covering songs such as \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) by Alicia Keys and \"Beautiful\" (2002) by Christina Aguilera on YouTube.[19] Lipa modelled with Topshop[28] and signed with a modelling agency, helping her land a role as a \"singer\" in an ITV advertisement for The X Factor in 2013, covering the song \"Lost in Music\" (1979).[31][32] She acquired a producer and a manager.[2][29] In 2013, Lipa signed a contract with Tap Management, directed by Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, while working as a waitress in a cocktail bar. Lipa was introduced to Mawson by her lawyer, who discouraged her from signing another publishing deal that was offered to her. Subsequently, they offered her a monthly salary to leave her job and focus on recording music.[33] During one of the sessions, Lipa co-wrote the song \"Hotter than Hell\",[33] which would eventually lead to her signing a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 2014.[34][35] Millett retrospectively elaborated: \"Dua was really smart \u2013 she signed to Warner Bros. partly because they didn't have a big female pop artist and they needed one. They really wanted her, so she had the focus of the team from day one.\"[33] In August 2015, Lipa released her first single, \"New Love\",[36] produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt.[37] Her second single, \"Be the One\", was issued to European success in October 2015,[38][39] reaching number one in Belgium,[40] Poland and Slovakia, as well as charting in the top ten in over eleven European territories.

She gets results out of other people as well, because her personality is so engaging and she is so charismatic. She definitely has that special something. \u2014Ben Mawson on Lipa's songwriting[45] On 18 February 2016, Lipa released her third single, \"Last Dance\", followed by \"Hotter than Hell\" on 6 May.

In addition, she stated that in her country of birth, the United Kingdom, the National Health Service is considered a \"right\".[281] In June 2020, Lipa shared an Instagram post that criticised the Israel Defense Forces' treatment of Palestinians and showed Israeli soldiers detaining Palestinian minors.[282] The post also referred to \"fake Jews in the Israeli government\" and \"fake Christians in the mid west [United States]\" who, it said, had created Hamas for people to \"believe that Hamas is the reason for the decades worth of occupation, oppression, ethnic cleansing, and murder.\"[283] An Im Tirtzu petition signed by over three thousand people was sent to the Israeli Minister of Defense, Benny Gantz, and the Israeli Minister of Culture and Sport, Hili Tropper, demanding that Lipa's songs be banned from Israeli Army Radio and Galgalatz due to what Im Tirtzu said was \"the incitement against IDF soldiers, the antisemitism, the blood libel, conspiracy theories and the blatant lies in the post\" shared by Lipa.[284][285] In response, the Army Radio said that \"Galgalatz does not boycott any artist\" and \"the songs are chosen at the discretion of the editors of each segment.\"[286][287] In July 2020, Lipa supported a campaign called \"Let the Music Play\" in which she signed an open letter sent to the then-Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, calling for support from the government of United Kingdom for the UK's live music industry's economic loss under the COVID-19 pandemic.[288] On 18 July 2020, Lipa shared a post on her Instagram story explaining \"why Kosovo is not and will never be Serbia\", urging followers to sign a petition which called for Apple to include Kosovo in its mapping services as an independent state.[289] The following day, she published on her social media an image of a banner containing an irredentist map of Greater Albania that reflected parts of Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Greece and North Macedonia as one nation appended with the definition of the word \"autochthonous\".[290] As the banner is commonly associated with extreme Albanian nationalism,[290] she received backlash on social media where she was accused of ethnic nationalism and fascism.[291][292] She subsequently stated that her post had been \"misinterpreted\" by people who promote ethnic separatism, an ideology that she \"completely rejects\".[293] In August, she urged her Instagram followers to vote against Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election.[294] After endorsing, and campaigning for, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primaries, Lipa expressed support for Joe Biden to become the U.S. president at a virtual event aimed at Albanian Americans later that year during the general election season, arguing that the Kosovars \"owed\" support to Biden because he was against the massacre and ethnic cleansing of Albanians by having supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.[295] In January 2021, she published a call to her Instagram followers to encourage Kosovo citizens to vote in the 2021 Kosovan parliamentary election.[296] In May 2021, after expressing solidarity for the death of innocent Palestinian civilians due to the Israel\u2013Palestine crisis, Lipa criticised The New York Times for publishing an advertisement characterizing her, along with Bella and Gigi Hadid, as antisemitic.[297] In July 2021, through her Sunny Hill Foundation, Lipa joined an initiative that was launched by the Municipality of Tirana, called \"Adopt a Kindergarten\".

She was quoted saying, \"The kindergarten will be very beautiful and I am very proud that Sunny Hill Foundation is a part of it. Let's see better things for our country. I am very proud to be Albanian.\"[298] The kindergarten was completed in October 2021, and was named \"Sunny Hill Kindergarten\".[299] Together with her father Dukagjin, she co-created the Sunny Hill Foundation in 2016 to raise funds to help people in Kosovo experiencing financial difficulties.

All proceeds went to families and victims affected by the seismic event.[313][314] On 15 March 2020, she asked her fans to make donations to the UNHCR agency to deal with COVID-19 pandemic because refugees are \"the most vulnerable on this planet\" and they \"often live in crowded places\" with \"limited health services\".[315][316] In the same month, she was part of a television special called \"Home Fest\" on The Late Late Show with James Corden From His Garage with the goal of raising money for CDC and Feed the Children where she performed her song, \"Don't Start Now\" (2019), from an apartment in London.[317] On 16 May 2020, she did a live performance of her song \"Break My Heart\" (2020) on the television special Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020 aimed at the high school students whose graduation ceremonies and proms were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[318] At the end of May 2020, she participated in a digital event called \"Dream With Us\" with the aim of raising funds,[319] whose event consisted of a streaming concert at which a portion of proceeds would go to organisations that help fight the disease of COVID-19.[320] She was part of a charitable project organised for BBC Radio 1 for a cover version of \"Times Like These\" released on 23 April 2020 in the segment Live Lounge.[321] She was part of the charity supergroup Live Lounge Allstars in which each member recorded and filmed their contribution to the song from their respective households to encourage social distancing in which profits from the single would primarily go to Children in Need and Comic Relief, as well as COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[322] She used social media to promove Lebanese citizens to donate blood to victims affected by the 2020 Beirut explosion.[323] She donated 5,000 euros to the Theatre of Dodona so that the venue could have its own ticket system and website.[324] She was part of an initiative organised by Belgian singer Angèle and KickCancer Foundation to fund research against childhood cancer, and it was about a charity raffle in which Lipa offered a manuscript of her song \"Don't Start Now\" (2019) as a prize.[325][326] She performed at 2021 Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party virtually to benefit the AIDS Foundation to combat HIV disease, whose event raised US$3 million.[327] On 1 March 2022, reggae band Artikal Sound System filed a suit against Lipa and her label Warner Records alleging copyright infringement, asserting similarities between \"Levitating\" and their 2017 song \"Live Your Life\".[328] A second suit by songwriters L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer claimed that \"Levitating\" infringed on their 1979 disco song \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night\".[329] Her first name \"Dua\" was her grandmother's suggestion and means \"love\" in Albanian.[330] She is occasionally referred to as Dula Peep, which originated as a mispronunciation by daytime television personality Wendy Williams in 2018.[331] She has since positively embraced the nickname.[332] Her native language is Albanian[23] and she also speaks English with a British accent.[333] In 2013, Lipa began an on-again, off-again relationship with English chef Isaac Carew, from whom she first split in February 2017.[334] She dated the then-lead singer of the American band LANY, Paul Klein, from August 2017 to January 2018.[335][336] Later, she resumed her relationship with Carew, whom she then dated from January 2018 to June 2019.[337] On 14 June 2019, she began a relationship with the American model Anwar Hadid.[338] Lipa and Hadid broke up in December 2021.[339]","Title":"Dua Lipa - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2979","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa"}
