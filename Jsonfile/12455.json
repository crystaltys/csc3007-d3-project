{"Content: ":"Jean-Luc Sandoz (born 1960 in Montandon) is a French-Swiss engineer and an expert in wood construction. He is the founder of several companies in the field of engineering, industrialization, construction and expertise, all related to wood. Formerly, he was a professor and lecturer at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).[1][2] Born into a family of farmers in the Haut-Doubs region, he became acquainted with the material wood, starting with a vocational training certificate in carpentry, followed by a BEP (vocational training certificate) in cabinetmaking, before joining the Lycée Bois de Mouchard in 1976, where he obtained a BTS (vocational training certificate) in wood construction.[3][4] After studies at ENSTIB (École Nationale Supérieure des Technologies et des Industries du Bois), in 1985, he began his thesis on the subject of ultrasound and the mechanical strength of wood, under the direction of Julius Natterer at EPFL. He obtained his PhD in 1990 for his thesis entitled \"Triage et fiabilité des bois de construction: validité de la méthode ultrason\" (Sorting and reliability of construction timber: validity of the ultrasonic method).[5] He continued research at the IBOIS (Laboratory for Timber Construction) at EPFL in two areas: non-destructive technologies to measure the mechanical quality of wood material and the optimisation of wooden structures for the application in large buildings.[6][7] In 1993, he was appointed assistant professor at EPFL.[8] Together with Julius Natterer and Martial Rey, Sandoz authored the textbook \"Construction en Bois\" (Wood Construction that has remained in print since its release in 1996 (20 new editions).[9] During this period he organised several international symposia among them the Symposium on Nondestructive Testing of Wood and the World Conference on Timber Engineering.[10][11] He registered several patents such as for a device for measuring the characteristics of wood using ultrasound (Sylvatest),[12] and an application for measuring wooden poles for overhead electricity and telephone lines (K-Store & Polux),[13], as well as for the construction of wood and mixed wood-concrete slabs as the Ariane truss.[14] In 1999, Sandoz left the academic world to devote himself to his company.[15][16] Sandoz integrates wood in all types of structures and buildings and optimises spans and heights, as well as for thermal and acoustic performance.[17] Several of his projects won awards.[18][19][20] Examples of Sandoz' structures: Expo.02 in Neuchâtel Expo.02 in Neuchâtel Expo.02 in Biel/Bienne Forbidden City in Beijing Wood characterisation at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou Wooden façade at the Vortex building in Lausanne Ecotim II - Industrial building - Architecture Amiot Lombard Herstal City Hall - Frédéric Haesevoets Architecture High school in Vendée, 2013 - Frédéric Fonteneau architect School in Courbevoie, 2013 - K-Architecture Wood elevation in Paris-Tolbiac, 2013 - Atelier Marie Schweitzer Sport Hall in Villeneuve-la-Garenne, 2011 - Tessier Poncelet Architects Sport Hall Hacine-Chérifi price World Architecture News in 2015 Charlie Chaplin School, 2014 - SAM Architecture School Saint-Exupéry in Sarcelles, 2011 - Gaëtan Le Penhuel Architectes School Brétigny-sur-Orge, 2013 - TOA Architectes Grand Chambéry Pool, 2020 - ALN Atelien Architecture Sport hall in Donzère with record of 45m Renovation for the city of Paris with Marie Schweitzer architect standing apartement rue de Javel with Marie Schweitzer architect","Title":"Jean-Luc Sandoz - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12455","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Sandoz"}
