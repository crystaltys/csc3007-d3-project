{"Content: ":"The New York State Democratic Committee is the affiliate of the Democratic Party in the U.S. state of New York. Its headquarters are in Manhattan, and it has an office in Albany.[2] It is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling the majority of New York's U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, the governorship, and has supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature. In the early 20th century when New York was without a Democratic governor, county leaders controlled nominations and campaign finances.[3] President John F. Kennedy got involved in the early 1960s, funneling federal patronage through New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. to the detriment of state chair Michael H. Prendergast.[3] In 1974, Democrats benefited from Republican problems stemming from the Watergate scandal, winning control of the New York State Assembly and electing a governor, Hugh Carey.[3] Democrats have controlled the Assembly ever since. Republicans controlled the State Senate for some years after that, but Democrats gained a decisive advantage in the chamber in 2018 and 2020. The State Committee is chaired by Jay S. Jacobs. The Executive Committee is chaired by former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. The Executive Director is Alexander Wang. The three Democratic presidents who were from New York are Franklin D. Roosevelt (32nd) who was the governor of New York from 1929 to 1932, Grover Cleveland (22nd and 24th) who was the governor from 1883 to 1885, and Martin Van Buren (eighth) who was the governor in 1829. Van Buren is also the only Democratic vice president who was from New York. The following is a list of elected statewide and federal Democratic officeholders: Democrats hold 19 of New York's 27 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and both of New York's seats in the U.S. Senate. Democrats have controlled both of New York's seats in the U.S. Senate since 1998: Senior U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (Majority Leader) Junior U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand NYS Democrats control all four of the elected statewide offices and NYS Cabinet and Departmental Head positions (e.g., New York State Department of Health, NYS Secretary of State, NYS Department of Corrections, New York State Office of People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, NYS Office of General Services, NYS Department of Education) and the Governor's Office. Governor Kathy Hochul Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado Attorney General Letitia James Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli As of 2019, Democrats control the mayor's offices in nine of New York's ten largest cities: Christine Callaghan Quinn (born July 25, 1966) is an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, she formerly served as the Speaker of the New York City Council. The third person to hold this office, she is the first female and first openly gay speaker.[3][4] As City Council speaker, Quinn was New York City's third most powerful public servant, behind the mayor and public advocate. She ran to succeed Michael Bloomberg as the city's mayor in the 2013 mayoral election, but she came in third in the Democratic primary.","Title":"New York State Democratic Committee - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5499","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Democratic_Committee"}
