{"Content: ":"William Michael Albert Broad (born 30 November 1955), known professionally as Billy Idol, is an English-American[1] singer and songwriter. He first achieved fame in the 1970s emerging from the London punk rock scene as the lead singer of the group Generation X. Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol a lead artist during the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" in the United States. The name \"Billy Idol\" was inspired by a schoolteacher's description of him as \"idle\".[2] Idol began his music career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band Chelsea. However, he soon left the group. With his former bandmate Tony James, Idol formed Generation X. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three albums on Chrysalis Records, then disbanded. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His debut studio album, Billy Idol (1982), was a commercial success. With music videos for singles \"Dancing with Myself\" and \"White Wedding\" Idol soon became a staple of then newly-established MTV. Idol's second studio album, Rebel Yell (1983), was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles \"Rebel Yell\" and \"Eyes Without a Face\". The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of two million copies in the US. In 1986, he released Whiplash Smile. Having accumulated three UK top 10 singles (\"Rebel Yell\", \"White Wedding\" and \"Mony Mony\") Idol released a 1988 greatest hits album titled Idol Songs: 11 of the Best; the album went platinum in the United Kingdom. Idol then released Charmed Life (1990) and the concept album Cyberpunk (1993). Idol spent the second half of the 1990s focusing on his personal life out of the public eye. He made a musical comeback with the release of Devil's Playground (2005) and again with Kings & Queens of the Underground (2014). Idol was born William Michael Albert Broad on 30 November 1955 in Stanmore, Middlesex, England.[3] His parents were devout Anglicans and attended church regularly. Billy is half Irish, his mother was born in Cork and is an O'Sullivan.[4][5] In 1958, when he was two years old, he moved with his parents to the US and settled in Patchogue, New York. They also lived in Rockville Centre, New York. His younger sister, Jane, was born during this time. The family returned to England four years later and settled in Dorking, Surrey.[6] In 1971, the family moved to Bromley in southeastern London, where Idol attended Ravensbourne School for Boys. His family later moved to the Worthing suburb of Goring-by-Sea in West Sussex, where he attended Worthing High School for Boys.[7] In October 1975, he attended the University of Sussex to pursue an English degree and lived on-campus (East Slope), but left after year one in 1976. He then went on to join the Bromley Contingent of Sex Pistols fans, a loose gang that travelled to wherever the band played.[8][9] The name \"Billy Idol\" was coined due to a chemistry teacher's description of Idol on his school report card as \"idle\". Idol has stated that the subject was one that he hated and in which he underachieved.[10][2] In an interview on 21 November 1983, Idol said the name \"Billy Idol\" \"was a bit of a goof, but part of the old English school of rock. It was a 'double thing', not just a poke at the superstar-like people... It was fun, you know?\"[11] In another interview for BBC Breakfast in October 2014, he said that he wanted to use the name \"Billy Idle\", but thought the name would be unavailable due to its similarity to the name of Monty Python star Eric Idle and chose Billy Idol instead.[12] In late 1976, he joined the newly-formed West London 1960s retro-rock band Chelsea as a guitarist.[13] The act's singer/frontman Gene October styled Idol's image, advising him to change his short sighted eye-glasses for contact lenses, and dye his hair blonde with a crew cut for a retro-1950s rocker look. After a few weeks performing with Chelsea, Idol and Tony James, the band's bass guitarist, quit the act and co-founded Generation X, with Idol switching from guitarist to the role of singer/frontman. Generation X was one of the first punk bands to appear on the BBC Television music programme Top of the Pops.[14] Although a punk rock band, they were inspired by mid-1960s British pop, in sharp contrast to their more militant peers, with Idol stating; \"We were saying the opposite to the Clash and the Pistols. They were singing 'No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones', but we were honest about what we liked. The truth was we were all building our music on the Beatles and the Stones\".[8] In 1977, Idol sang \"Your Generation\" on the TV series Marc. Generation X signed with Chrysalis Records, released three albums, performed in the 1980 film D.O.A., and then disbanded.[15] \"MTV has paved the way for a host of invaders from abroad: Def Leppard, Adam Ant, Madness, Eurythmics, the Fixx and Billy Idol, to name a few. In return, grateful Brits, even superstars like Pete Townshend and the Police, have mugged for MTV promo spots and made the phrase 'I want my MTV' a household commonplace.\" \u2014Anglomania: The Second British Invasion, by Parke Puterbaugh for Rolling Stone, November 1983.[16] Idol moved to New York City in 1981 and became a solo artist, working with former Kiss manager Bill Aucoin. Idol's punk-like image worked well with the glam rock style of his new partner on guitar, Steve Stevens.[17] Together they worked with bassist Phil Feit and drummer Gregg Gerson. Idol's solo career began with the Chrysalis Records EP titled Don't Stop in 1981, which included the Generation X song \"Dancing with Myself\", originally recorded for their last album Kiss Me Deadly, and a cover of Tommy James & the Shondells' song \"Mony Mony\". Idol's debut solo album Billy Idol was released in July 1982.[18] Part of the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" of the US in 1982, Idol became an MTV staple with \"White Wedding\" and \"Dancing with Myself\". The music video for \"White Wedding\" was filmed by the British director David Mallet, and played frequently on MTV. The motorcycle smashing through the church window stunt was carried out by John Wilson, a London motorcycle courier. In 1983, Idol's label released \"Dancing with Myself\" in the US in conjunction with a music video directed by Tobe Hooper, which played on MTV for six months.[citation needed] Rebel Yell (1983), Idol's second LP, was a major success[19] and established Idol in the United States with hits such as \"Rebel Yell\", \"Eyes Without a Face\", and \"Flesh for Fantasy\". \"Eyes Without a Face\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, and \"Rebel Yell\" reached number six in the UK Singles Chart.[20][21] Idol released Whiplash Smile in 1986, which sold well.[19] The album included the hits \"To Be a Lover\", \"Don't Need a Gun\" and \"Sweet Sixteen\". Idol filmed a video for the song \"Sweet Sixteen\" in Florida's Coral Castle.[22] A remix album was released in 1987, titled Vital Idol. The album featured a live rendition of his cover of Tommy James' \"Mony Mony\". In 1987 the single topped the United States chart and reached number 7 in the UK.[19][21] Charmed Life was released in 1990, and a video for the single \"Cradle of Love\" had to be shot. The song had been featured in the Andrew Dice Clay film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Because Idol was unable to walk, due to injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident,[23] he was shot from the waist up. The video featured video footage of him singing in large frames throughout an apartment while Betsy Lynn George was trying to seduce a businessman. The video was placed in rotation on MTV. \"Cradle of Love\" earned Idol a third Grammy nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance.[24] In 1993, Idol released Cyberpunk.[25] Regarded as experimental, it was recorded in a home studio using a Macintosh computer. Idol used Studiovision and Pro-Tools to record the album. The album took ten months to make. The album was successful in UK and Europe, but it did not perform well in the United States despite the commercial success of \"Shock to the System\".
