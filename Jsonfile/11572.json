{"Content: ":"Eochondrosteus is a genus of extinct actinopterygian (ray-finned fish), comprising one species, E. sinensis (monotypy). It is the most basal acipenseriform and related with the families Chondrosteidae and Peipiaosteidae, as well as with Acipenseroidei (sturgeon, paddlefish, and their fossil relatives).[1] Eochondrosteus lived during the Early Triassic in what is now Gansu Province (Beishan Hills), China (previously interpreted as Permian in age).[2]   This order Acipenseriformes (Sturgeon and Paddlefish) related article is a stub.
