{"Content: ":"The Gutleutviertel is a quarter of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It is part of the Ortsbezirk Innenstadt I. The name Gutleut originates from the \"Gutleuthof\", once a refuge for lepers hosted by the \"fraternity of the good people\". The former working class district has spruced up considerably in recent years with the development of a new housing and business district at the former West Harbor.
