The mosque in Babenhäuser Landstraße is run by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community (AMJ) and was inaugurated on September, 12th 1959 by Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan. Before the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in 1985 bought the \u201eNasir Bagh\u201c in Groß-Gerau, the annual gathering Jalsa Salana in Germany was celebrated in this mosque. This mosque is well known for being the one that the heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali prayed within once.[1]  This article about a mosque or other Islamic place of worship in Europe is a stub.
