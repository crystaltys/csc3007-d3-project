{"Content: ":"The Corconti or Korkontoi were an ancient people, named as Germanic, in (2.10) of the Geography of Ptolemy (after 83 \u2013 161 AD). They resided in the vicinity of Asciburgius Mountain near the Elbe river. Asciburgius was on the edge of the modern Sudetes range (Krkono≈°e in Czech, Karkonosze in Polish, Riesengebirge in German). The name of the tribe may be related to the modern Slavic names for the terrain but that is uncertain. Ptolemy counted them among the peoples inhabiting Magna Germania. Their eastern neighbours were the Lugi Buri, who bordered the sources of the Vistula.","Title":"Corconti - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7798","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corconti"}
