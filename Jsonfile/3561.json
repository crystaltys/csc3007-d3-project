{"Content: ":"Prospect is a Canadian coastal community on the Chebucto Peninsula in Nova Scotia, Canada within the Halifax Regional Municipality. It borders the Atlantic Ocean approximately 23 kilometres (14 mi) southwest of Halifax off the Prospect Road (Route 333). During the American Revolution, fishermen at Prospect captured an American Privateer and 23 crew members.[1] In 2003, the town was hit by the eye of Hurricane Juan. Wind damage was substantial and storm surge washed away many wharfs and stages, but no homes. The area suffered significant land erosion due to the impact. There are no churches in Prospect since the closing of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel. Nearby are St. Joseph (Shad Bay), New Life Community Church (Hatchet Lake), St. Timothy's (Brookside), and St. James (Goodwood).  This Halifax County, Nova Scotia location article is a stub.
