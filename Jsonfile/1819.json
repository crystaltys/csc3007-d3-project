{"Content: ":"In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as (1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand;[1][2] (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus[2] and; (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as wrist joints.[3][4] This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, bracelet lines, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum. As a consequence of these various definitions, fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures, while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered fractures to the wrist. The distal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint located between the bones of the forearm, the radius and ulna. Formed by the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch of the radius, this joint is separated from the radiocarpal joint by an articular disk lying between the radius and the styloid process of the ulna. The capsule of the joint is lax and extends from the inferior sacciform recess to the ulnar shaft. Together with the proximal radioulnar joint, the distal radioulnar joint permits pronation and supination.[5] The radiocarpal joint or wrist joint is an ellipsoid joint formed by the radius and the articular disc proximally and the proximal row of carpal bones distally. The carpal bones on the ulnar side only make intermittent contact with the proximal side \u2014 the triquetrum only makes contact during ulnar abduction. The capsule, lax and un-branched, is thin on the dorsal side and can contain synovial folds. The capsule is continuous with the midcarpal joint and strengthened by numerous ligaments, including the palmar and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments, and the ulnar and radial collateral ligaments. [6] The parts forming the radiocarpal joint are the lower end of the radius and under surface of the articular disk above; and the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetral bones below. The articular surface of the radius and the undersurface of the articular disk form together with a transversely elliptical concave surface, the receiving cavity. The superior articular surfaces of the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum form a smooth convex surface, the condyle, which is received into the concavity.[7] Carpal bones of the hand: In the hand proper a total of 13 bones form part of the wrist: eight carpal bones\u2014scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate\u2014 and five metacarpal bones\u2014the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metacarpal bones.[8] The midcarpal joint is the S-shaped joint space separating the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones. The intercarpal joints, between the bones of each row, are strengthened by the radiate carpal and pisohamate ligaments and the palmar, interosseous, and dorsal intercarpal ligaments. Some degree of mobility is possible between the bones of the proximal row while the bones of the distal row are connected to each other and to the metacarpal bones \u2014at the carpometacarpal joints\u2014 by strong ligaments \u2014the pisometacarpal and palmar and dorsal carpometacarpal ligament\u2014 that makes a functional entity of these bones. Additionally, the joints between the bases of the metacarpal bones \u2014the intermetacarpal articulations\u2014 are strengthened by dorsal, interosseous, and palmar intermetacarpal ligaments.[6] The earliest carpal bones to ossify are capitate bone and hamate bone in the first six months of an infant life.[9] The radiocarpal, intercarpal, midcarpal, carpometacarpal, and intermetacarpal joints often intercommunicate through a common synovial cavity. [10] It has two articular surfaces named, proximal and distal articular surfaces respectively. The proximal articular surface is made up of the lower end of the radius and a triangular articular disc of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. On the other hand, the distal articular surface is made up of proximal surfaces of the scaphoid, triquetral and lunate bones.[11] The extrinsic hand muscles are located in the forearm where their bellies form the proximal fleshy roundness. When contracted, most of the tendons of these muscles are prevented from standing up like taut bowstrings around the wrist by passing under the flexor retinaculum on the palmar side and the extensor retinaculum on the dorsal side. On the palmar side the carpal bones form the carpal tunnel,[12] through which some of the flexor tendons pass in tendon sheaths that enable them to slide back and forth through the narrow passageway (see carpal tunnel syndrome).[13] Starting from the mid-position of the hand, the movements permitted in the wrist proper are (muscles in order of importance):[14][15] However, movements at the wrist can not be properly described without including movements in the distal radioulnar joint in which the rotary actions of supination and pronation occur and this joint is therefore normally regarded as part of the wrist.[17] Wrist pain has a number of causes, including carpal tunnel syndrome,[16] ganglion cyst,[19] tendinitis,[20] and osteoarthritis. Tests such as Phalen's test involve palmarflexion at the wrist. The hand may deviate at the wrist in some conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Ossification of the bones around the wrist is one indicator used in taking a bone age. A wrist fracture usually means a fracture of the distal radius. The English word \"wrist\" is etymologically derived from the ancient German word wristiz from which are derived modern German rist (\"instep\", \"wrist\") and modern Swedish vrist (\"instep\", \"ankle\"). The base writh- and its variants are associated with Old English words \"wreath\", \"wrest\", and \"writhe\". The wr- sound of this base seems originally to have been symbolic of the action of twisting.[21] Wrist joint. Deep dissection. Posterior view. Wrist joint. Deep dissection. Posterior view.
