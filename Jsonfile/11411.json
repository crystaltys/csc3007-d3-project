From 2014 to 2015, Calderwood was also NHS England's national clinical director for maternity and women's health. Following the retirement of Sir Harry Burns as Chief Medical Officer for Scotland (CMO), she was appointed Acting Deputy CMO for Scotland, a position she held until February 2015. Calderwood was appointed the CMO for Scotland shortly after. As one of Scotland's top medical advisors, she reported and advised the Scottish Government over the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, Calderwood was forced to resign after she was caught breaking her department's own advice on COVID. She returned to medical practice and in January 2021 was appointed the Executive National Clinical Director of Centre for Sustainable Delivery of Health and Social Care at the Golden Jubilee University National Hospital.

In February 2015, Calderwood was announced as the new Chief Medical Officer of Scotland, succeeding Burns. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, Calderwood apologised for visiting her second home in Earlsferry, Fife, about 44 miles (71 km) from her home in Edinburgh, on consecutive weekends with her family, contravening the advice issued by herself in her high-profile role as Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, her own office, and the Scottish Government to stay at home and help limit the spread of the virus.[15][16][17] On 5 April 2020 she was visited at home by officers from Police Scotland and warned about her conduct.[15] In a government press conference later that day, she admitted she had visited her holiday home more than once during lockdown and apologised.[18] The most recent visit had been on 4 April 2020.[19] Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, Monica Lennon, called for Calderwood's resignation, saying \"The CMO has undermined Scotland\u2019s pandemic response and if she doesn't offer her resignation the First Minister should sack her.\"[20] On the afternoon of the 5 April 2020 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that Calderwood would be \"withdrawing from media briefings for the foreseeable future\" and explained that the government would be revising its public information campaign. Several hours later, on the evening of 5 April 2020, Calderwood resigned.[21] She issued this statement: \"People across Scotland know what they need to do to reduce the spread of this virus and that means they must have complete trust in those who give them advice\".[19][22] The following morning, Sturgeon told BBC Breakfast that she and Calderwood had had a \"long conversation\" on the evening of the 5 April. Sturgeon reported that as a result of this conversation she and Calderwood mutually agreed that Calderwood should stand down from being Chief Medical Officer for Scotland.[21][23] Calderwood married Angus Loudon, executive director of the charity St John Scotland, in September 2019 at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh.[24] Calderwood has three children.[2][4][14]","Title":"Catherine Calderwood - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11411","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Calderwood"}
