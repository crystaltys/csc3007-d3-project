{"Content: ":"Above: Russian bombardment of the Kyiv TV Tower in Kyiv, 1 March 2022 The battle of Kyiv was part of the Kyiv offensive in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine for control of Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine, and surrounding districts. The combatants were elements of the Russian Armed Forces and Ukrainian Ground Forces. The battle lasted from 25 February 2022 to 2 April 2022 and ended with the withdrawal of Russian forces. Initially, Russian forces captured key areas to the north and west of Kyiv, leading to international speculation of the city's imminent fall. However, stiff Ukrainian resistance sapped the momentum. Poor Russian logistics and tactical decisions helped the defenders to thwart efforts at encirclement, and, after a month of protracted fighting, Ukrainian forces mounted successful counterattacks. Russians began to withdraw on 29 March; on 2 April, the Ukrainian authorities declared that Kyiv and its surrounding province were again under Ukrainian control. Russian forces engaged Ukrainian troops at Hostomel Airport on 24 February 2022. A key supply point for Russian troops near Kyiv, the airport, located in Hostomel, a town northwest of the city, was captured the following day.[31] On the morning of 25 February, three Russian saboteurs, dressed as Ukrainian soldiers, entered Obolon District, 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Verkhovna Rada building, the seat of the parliament of Ukraine.[32][33] They were killed by Ukrainian forces afterwards.[34][35] Several hours later, a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft was shot down over the city, eventually crashing into an apartment building.[28] Throughout the day, gunfire was heard at several wards of the city.
