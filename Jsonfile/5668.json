French Gates has consistently been ranked as one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes.[3] In 2000, she and her then-husband Bill Gates co-founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private charitable organization as of 2015.[4] She and her ex-husband have been awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honour. In early May 2021, Bill and Melinda Gates announced they were getting divorced but will still remain co-chairs of the foundation.[5] Melinda Ann French was born on August 15, 1964, in Dallas, Texas.[6][7][8] She is the second of four children born to Raymond Joseph French Jr., an aerospace engineer, and Elaine Agnes Amerland, a homemaker.

She was ranked #3 in Forbes 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017 lists of the 100 Most Powerful Women,[51] #4 in 2012 and 2016, #5 in 2020, and #6 in 2011, 2018, and 2019. She was awarded the UCSF medal in 2013.[52] French Gates was appointed an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2013 for services to philanthropy and international development.[53] In recognition of the foundation's philanthropic activities in India, Bill and Melinda jointly received India's third-highest civilian honor, Padma Bhushan, in 2015.[54] In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded French Gates and her husband with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their philanthropic efforts.[55] In 2017, President François Hollande awarded France's highest national honour to French Gates and her husband for their charitable efforts, i.e. as Commander of the Legion of Honour.[56] That year, she was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal 2016 of the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN), Berlin-Brandenburg, \"for outstanding services to peace and international understanding\" in the historic Berlin Town Hall.[57][58] That year, French Gates was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 12 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide.[59][60] French Gates's experience of a male-dominated workplace at Microsoft inspired her to encourage more women in the computing field.[61] In September 2016, she announced her desire to increase diversity in the workplace, especially in the technology industry, stating: \"Every company needs technology, and yet we're graduating fewer women technologists. That is not good for society. We have to change it.\"[62] French Gates also spoke about this topic at the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an annual series of conferences.[63]","Title":"Melinda French Gates - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5668","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_French_Gates"}
