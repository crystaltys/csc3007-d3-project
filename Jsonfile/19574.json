Cody Hay teamed up with Annabelle Langlois in 2005.[1] The pair finished 4th at the 2006 Skate America. They were forced to withdraw from their second event, 2006 Cup of Russia, because the airline lost Langlois' skates.[2] Langlois/Hay took bronze at the 2007 Canadian Championships and were named to their first Worlds team. They placed 10th at the 2007 World Championships in Tokyo, Japan. In the 2007\u201308 season, Langlois/Hay competed at Skate Canada and NHK Trophy, before winning their first national title at the 2008 Canadian Championships in Vancouver, British Columbia. They went on to compete at the 2008 World Championships in Sweden, where they placed 8th. Langlois sustained a spiral fracture to her lower right fibula during practice on July 23, 2008 and underwent surgery a week later, after which she had five screws and a metal plate in her ankle.[3][4] The pair, assigned to the 2008 Skate Canada International and 2008 NHK Trophy,[5] withdrew from both Grand Prix events.[4] Langlois returned to training in mid-September but had trouble walking during a January 6, 2009 practice session.[3] It was determined that she had tissue damage and the pair withdrew from the 2009 Canadian Championships.[3] Around February 2009, she had surgery to remove the screws and metal plate.[6] The pair subsequently withdrew from the 2009 Four Continents Championships and 2009 World Championships.[4][7] Langlois/Hay's first international competition back from her injury was the 2009 Nebelhorn Trophy held in Oberstdorf, Germany.
