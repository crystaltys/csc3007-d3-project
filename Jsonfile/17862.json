{"Content: ":"To Live (Russian: 'Жить', romanized: Zhit) is a 2010 Russian drama film written, directed by Yuri Bykov. It is his debut film.[1][2] It premiered at the Kinotavr film festival.[3] In the Russian countryside, Mikhail is hunting when he encounters Andrey, a criminal who is running from three men who are trying to kill him. They are compelled to try to escape together, first in Mikhail's car, then on foot, while tension builds between them.[3] Variety described the film as \"[a]n impressively confident feature debut\", while noting that it had been the subject of controversy due to the \"onscreen death of an animal\" (although the film's credits state that no animal was actually harmed).[3]  This article related to Russian film is a stub.
