{"Content: ":"Other parties (124) Vacant (2) The State Duma (Russian: Госуда́рственная ду́ма, tr. Gosudárstvennaya dúma), commonly abbreviated in Russian as Gosduma (Russian: Госду́ма), is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, while the upper house is the Federation Council. The Duma headquarters are located in central Moscow, a few steps from Manege Square. Its members are referred to as deputies. The State Duma replaced the Supreme Soviet as a result of the new constitution introduced by Boris Yeltsin in the aftermath of the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, and approved in a nationwide referendum. In the 2007 and 2011 Russian legislative elections a full party-list proportional representation with 7% electoral threshold system was used, but this was subsequently repealed. The legislature's term length was initially 2 years in the 1993\u20131995 elections period, and 4 years in 1999\u20132007 elections period; since the 2011 elections the term length is 5 years. The history of the Duma dates back to the Boyar dumas of Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia as well to Tsarist Russia.[3][4][5] The State Duma was founded in 1905 after the violence and upheaval in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and was Russia's first elected parliament. The first two attempts by Tsar Nicholas II (1868-1918) to make it active were ineffective. Subsequently, each of these Dumas was dissolved after only a few months. The third Duma was the only one to last until the end of its five-year term. After the 1907 electoral reform, the third Duma, elected in November 1907, was largely made up of members of the upper classes, as radical influences in the Duma had almost entirely been removed. The establishment of the Duma after the 1905 Revolution was to herald significant changes to the previous Russian Imperial autocratic system. Furthermore, the Duma was later to have an important effect on Russian history, as it was one of the contributing factors in the February Revolution of 1917, the first of two that year, which led to the abolition of autocracy in Russia and the overthrow of the Tsar. Several generations and 75 years later after another revolutionary era, in the December 1993 elections pro-Yeltsin parties won 175 seats in the Duma versus 125 seats for the left bloc. The balance of power lay with the sixty-four deputies of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Only parties that won more than five percent of the vote were given party-list seats: eight passed the threshold in 1993. In addition to those eight parties, a pool of thirty-five deputies was entitled to form a registered group to reflect regional or sectoral interests. Business was governed by a steering committee, the Duma Council, consisting of one person from each party or group. The most important task was dividing up the chair positions in the Duma's twenty-three committees, which was done as part of a power-sharing \"package\" deal. Despite the fact that the 1993 Russian Constitution states that the State Duma is elected for four years, it was decided to elect the first State Duma for two years.[6] During the second half of the 1990s, the Duma became an important forum for lobbying by regional leaders and businessmen looking for tax breaks and legislative favors. The work of the leading committees, such as those for defense, foreign affairs, or budget, attracted a good deal of media attention and lobbying activity. In the early 2000s, following the 1999 parliamentary elections, the pro-presidential Unity party and the Communist Party were the leading forces in the State Duma. After the 2003 elections, a Dominant-party system was established in the State Duma with the pro-presidential United Russia party. In all subsequent elections, United Russia has always received an absolute majority of seats (more than 226). After the 2007 elections, a four-party system was formed with a United Russia, Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party and A Just Russia. Other parties could not get enough votes to go to the State Duma. Only in 2016 elections, two other parties, Rodina and the Civic Platform, were able to get one seat. In 2008, after the adoption of amendments to the Constitution, the term of the State Duma was increased from four to five years. In 2014, the State Duma elected in 2011 took part in criminally integrating recently annexed Crimea.[7] These Russian actions followed the bombing of the independent Nation of the Ukraine, intercession by the US to stop planes over Ukrainian airspace, reports to the UN Human Rights Council and UN High Commissioner Including government beheading (as Ukrainian government office takeover), association with concurrent chemical weapons use in Syria on children, and \"annexation of five trading seaports in Ukraine\", including the lease agreement with Ukraine on Sevastapol. The latter are governed by Black Sea Development Bank, Black Sea Trade Association , and Black Seaports Association with 11 members, including Nations of Ukraine and Georgia (both invaded by Russia in 2008, 2014 respectively). A 2016 exposé by Dissernet showed that one in nine members of the State Duma had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.[8] In 2018, it became known that the State Duma building will be reconstructed. In March 2019 it became known that the repair will begin in May 2019 and will end in September 2020. During this period, the State Duma was temporarily housed in the House of Unions. In addition, a draft of a new conference room, which would be an amphitheatre, was presented.[9][10][11] Following the results of the 2021 election, in addition to the four main parties, the New People party was also elected to the State Duma. Thus, for the first time since 1999, a five-party State Duma was formed.[12] The State Duma has special powers enumerated by the Constitution of Russia. They are: The State Duma adopts decrees on issues relating to its authority by the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The legal framework that is used to elect Duma differed over the years.[13][7] Save to parliamentary election of 2007 and election of 2011 the mixed system of parallel voting was used to elect Duma. The system was restored back in February 2014 from a party-list proportional representation system enacted in 2003 with an increased threshold of 7% which was lowered this time to 5%.[7][13] According to the law adopted in 2014 the Russian territory is divided into constituencies which are used for elections of single candidates per constituency. The entire Russia (e.g., \"Chuvash Republic; Republic of Kalmykia, Republic of Sakha, Altai Republic; Republic of Dagestan with 31 indigenous groups or enclaves) however is treated as a single constituency for the party-lists ballots.[14] Bills of the State Duma are adopted by a majority of the total number of deputies of the State Duma, unless another procedure is envisaged by the Constitution. All bills are first approved by the State Duma and are further debated and approved (or rejected) by the Federation Council. Relatively few roll call votes have been published that identify individual deputies' votes.[15] The votes of individuals are recorded only if the voting is open and the electronic method is used.[15] While not all votes are officially roll call votes, every time a deputy electronically votes a computer registers the individual deputy's vote.[16] Any Russian citizen who is age 21 or older is eligible to participate in the election may be elected deputy to the State Duma.[17] However, that same person may not be a deputy to the Federation Council. In addition, a State Duma deputy cannot hold office in any other representative body of state power or bodies of local self-government. The office as deputy of the State Duma is a full-time and professional position.[18] Thus, deputies to the State Duma may not be employed in the civil service or engage in any activities for remuneration other than teaching, research or other creative activities. 1 (1993) (members) 2 (1995) 3 (1999) 4 (2003) 5 (2007) 6 (2011) 7 (2016) (members) 8 (2021) (members) 9 (2026 or before) Coordinates: 55°45\u203227\u2033N 37°36\u203255\u2033E﻿ / ﻿55.75750°N 37.61528°E﻿ / 55.75750; 37.61528","Title":"State Duma - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15991","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma"}
