Bangladesh ordered vaccines produced by Serum Institute of India, however it delivered less than half of the doses as agreed to Bangladesh.[5] After the vaccine shortage due to this, Bangladesh approved the Russian Sputnik V and Chinese Sinopharm BIBP vaccines for emergency use in late April 2021.[6][7] Bangladesh has also authorized the emergency of Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and to be distributed as part of COVAX and Bangladesh until Feb 2022 Largest Recipient of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Donations with over 61 Million Total Doses was reported that the Bangladesh government planned to give permission to Bangladeshi made Bangavax developed by Globe Biotech Ltd.[8] to conduct the first clinical trial that got listed in the 'Draft landscape and tracker of Covid-19 candidate vaccines'[9] by the World Health Organization (WHO).[10] However fate of the Bangavax is still uncertain due to an unknown reason.[11] As of October 2021, Bangladesh has fully approved 7 COVID-19 vaccines. Feb 2022 Bangladesh Now Largest Recipient of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Donations and Shared with over 61 Million Total Doses of Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines On 21 June 2020, China invited Bangladesh to get priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine once it was successfully developed.[12] In July 2020, Sinovac Biotech was given approval by the Bangladesh Medical Research Council to begin a Phase III trial of CoronaVac at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.[13] However, Bangladesh later decided to cancel the trial of the vaccine after Sinovac asked to co-fund the domestic trials, which would have cost roughly $7 million.[14] On 2 July 2020, a Bangladeshi private pharmaceutical company named Globe Biotech Limited claimed to be the first company from Bangladesh to have a COVID-19 vaccine under development.[15] The lone Bangladeshi company actually developed three COVID-19 vaccine candidates, all with different technologies.[16] The company named the mRNA based vaccin as Bangavax, which was initially called Bancovid.[17] Globe Biotech took all the necessary steps from December 2020 to January 2021 to get the permission for ethical approval to conduct the first clinical trial of Bangavax.[18] On 5 November 2020, a tripartite agreement was signed between the government of Bangladesh, the Serum Institute of India, and Beximco Pharma of Bangladesh.

The U.S. donated 10 million additional Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to Bangladesh via COVAX, on February 01 February 23, the U.S. donated another 6.2 million Pfizer COVID19 vaccines to Bangladesh. Bangladesh began the administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 27 January 2021, focusing initially on a pilot program of 500 health workers,[56] while mass vaccination started on 7 February 2021.[1][2] It was planned that 6 million doses would be administered in the first month, and a further 5 million the following month.[56] An online registration portal was launched where citizens registered using their NID number. Initially, registration was open to those aged 55 and above, but due to lower than expected take-up, this was promptly lowered to ages 40 and above.[57] On 5 July 2021, after the vaccination programme had re-opened, DGHS announced the registration age would be lowered to 35 years[58] and then 30 years on 19 July.[59] University vaccination or Univac was launched to vaccinate university students.[60][61] Since the vaccination minimum age was reduced to 18, but many did not have NID to register at the main government vaccine website(https://surokkha.gov.bd) another website(https://univac.ugc.gov.bd) was launched to allow university students with birth certificates to register for the vaccine. On November 2nd, the campaign to vaccinate 12-17 year olds in school started. They had to register through their schools to be vaccinated.","Title":"COVID-19 vaccination in Bangladesh - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11216","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Bangladesh"}
