{"Content: ":"As with other sports, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to Gaelic games, primarily in Ireland but also elsewhere in the world. Competitions have been cancelled, postponed or restructured, while some teams have withdrawn or been unable to participate in those that have gone ahead. The sports (football, hurling, camogie, and ladies' football) saw all competitions suspended from 12 March 2020. The National Hurling League, National Football League, National Camogie League and Ladies' National Football League, which were all running at the time, were suspended, with competitions not intended to resume until 29 March at the earliest.[1] This proved to be an optimistic assumption. The 2020 Football and Hurling Leagues, as well as a revised 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and 2020 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship were completed rapidly (and behind closed doors) between October and December of that year, in the period corresponding roughly to the gap between the second and third waves of the pandemic.[2][3] London and New York were forced out of the football by the pandemic, the English-based teams missed the hurling. The Sligo county football team missed the 2020 championship due to an outbreak. The 2020 Camogie and Ladies' Leagues were cancelled. The 2021 National Hurling League and 2021 National Football League were delayed when a third wave of the pandemic struck Ireland, infecting more people in the month of January 2021 than in the entirety of 2020.[4] On 26 June, the GAA announced its decision to cancel the 2020 Provincial and All-Ireland Club Championships, which had taken place annually since 1971, due to the need to \"build in a rest period for people\".[110] On 4 July, shortly after clubs resumed contact training, Kilkenny GAA club James Stephens announced it had ceased all activity for one week after one of its hurlers tested positive for COVID-19; he had by then recovered.[111][112] In mid-July, three GAA clubs in West Cork (Argideen Rangers, Ballinascarthy and Oliver Plunketts) suspended their activities due to uncertainty whether its members had had contact with someone found to have COVID-19.[112] The Agrideen Rangers chairman later informed RTÉ Sport that each of the club's players had subsequently tested negative.[113] On 12 July, a member of Dublin GAA club Man-O-War tested positive for COVID-19 and Cork GAA club Glanworth confirmed that a player had tested positive; both clubs suspended activities.[113] On 14 July, Down GAA club Atticall became the first GAA club based in Ulster to confirm a member had tested positive for COVID-19; the club suspended activities until 19 July at the earliest even though the GAA said it could continue.[114] On 16 July, two Derry GAA clubs (Banagher and Craigbane) suspended all activities as a precautionary measure; they were joined by eight others (Ardmore, Claudy, Drum, Drumsurn, Foreglen, Glack, Limavady and Magilligan) the following day after a cluster of COVID-19 emerged in the Limavady area, in the north of the county.[115] The nearby Donegal GAA club Naomh Colmcille followed suit on 18 July, having played Glack in a challenge match the previous weekend.[116] Donegal GAA later clarified that it had not asked Naomh Colmcille to suspend activities, though it respected the club's decision.[117] On 21 July, two Tyrone GAA clubs (Aghaloo O'Neills and Eglish St Patrick's) suspended their activities after an Eglish player, who had played in a league game between the clubs the previous weekend, tested positive for COVID-19; the entire Eglish squad then required testing to determine the presence or absence of the virus.[118] Eglish's other players were permitted to resume activities on 24 July.[119] On 23 July, Armagh GAA club Killeavy and Down GAA club Longstone suspended activities with one player from each club having tested psoitive for COVID-19.[34] By 24 July, four other Killeavy players had tested positive for COVID-19.[120] On 28 July, Donegal GAA club Naomh Conaill suspended activities while it awaited the outcome of a test result.[121] On 18 August, Sligo GAA club Eastern Harps suspended activities as a precaution due to possible contact with a COVID-19 case.[122] Dublin GAA club Clanna Gael Fontenoy forfeited a Dublin Junior Hurling Championship quarter-final against Ballyboden St Enda's due to be played on the morning of 23 August after the denial of an attempt at postponement following a COVID-19 positive test in the Ballyboden team.[123] On 22 September, Donegal GAA postponed the Donegal Senior Football Championship final until 7 October after a player tested COVID-19 positive.[124] The game had initially been set to proceed but was then postponed.[125] On 26 September, Longford GAA postponed the Longford Senior Football Championship semi-finals and the Longford Intermediate Football Championship final due to the detection of COVID-19 cases.[126] On 26 September, Leitrim GAA postponed the Leitrim Intermediate Football Championship final due to COVID-19 issues.[127] A Galway Intermediate Football Championship semi-final was rescheduled at short notice when a player was informed that he had been a close contact of a COVID-19 case.[128] On 1 October, South Kerry GAA postponed 4 October's South Kerry Senior Football Championship final due to a COVID-19 issue.[42][129] On 2 October, Armagh GAA suspended all club activity due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the area.[42][130] The Waterford Intermediate Football Championship final on 4 October featured a Dungarvan player who later tested COVID-19 positive and appeared for his club while awaiting the result of his test.[131] After club games were suspended on 5 October, and the switch made to inter-county, many counties had not completed their competitions - the following senior finals went unplayed in 2020: the Cork Senior Football Championship, Donegal Senior Football Championship and Waterford Senior Football Championship, the Kildare Senior Hurling Championship, Laois Senior Hurling Championship, Meath Senior Hurling Championship and Offaly Senior Hurling Championship, while the following senior semi-finals went unplayed in 2020: the Carlow Senior Football Championship, Laois Senior Football Championship and Longford Senior Football Championship, as well as other competitions at intermediate and junior levels.[109][132] By the first anniversary (12 March 2021) of the GAA's first suspension of activities, club players had been permitted to play for only around three of the previous twelve months.[75] In May 2021, Wexford GAA clubs Shelmaliers and Faythe Harriers suspended all club activity due to the possibility of infection with COVID-19, with the St Martin's club later doing likewise after one of their players tested positive for COVID-19.[133]  The pandemic's arrival coincided with the playing of the National Leagues. Play was suspended from 12 March 2020. Ahead lay the 133rd All-Ireland Championships in football and hurling, annual competitions with an unbroken run stretching back to 1887. Though often delayed due to such incidents as outbreaks of polio and foot-and-mouth disease, the All-Ireland Championships had never previously been cancelled, even during the two World Wars. Following an interview given by GAA president John Horan on The Sunday Game on 10 May, RTÉ described \"the prospect of a fallow GAA year\" as \"very possible\".[134] On 12 September, the GAA announced it would formally go ahead with the year's All-Ireland Football and Hurling Championships at senior, under-20 and minor levels from October after receiving a promise of government funding to help stage the events.[36] Ulster GAA confirmed ahead of the 2020 Ulster Senior Football Championship that the final would not be held at its traditional venue of St Tiernach's Park due to the absence of floodlights.[135] The Athletic Grounds in Armagh was chosen instead.[136] On 25 September, the GAA announced details of its rescheduled remaining fixtures in the National Football League and National Hurling League, to resume on the weekend of 17\u201318 October.[137] Ahead of the resumption, the GAA denied suggestions it would cancel the competitions, though it had cancelled the League finals.[138] Donegal's footballers travelled the round-trip of 900 kilometres to Tralee in their own cars to play Kerry, a feat described in the Irish Independent as the \"most eye-catching example of GAA expeditions in the Covid era\".[139] 17 Fermanagh footballers were out for the resumption, ten COVID-19 positive and seven others self-isolating.[140] One of those who tested positive, Aidan Breen, spoke publicly about his experience as Fermanagh unsuccessfully attempted to have their first league game postponed.[141] With a \"number of players... awaiting test results\", Leitrim were unable to field a football team and conceded their opening fixture to Down, the first team forced to do so.[142] On 13 October, the Moycullen club withdrew its panel members on the Galway county football team after a COVID-19 outbreak there shortly after that club won its first Galway Senior Football Championship.[143] On 20 October, Longford GAA conceded their next football fixture, away to Cork, their manager Padraic Davis calling it a \"dead rubber\" (as Cork had previously secured promotion to Division 2) and both teams were scheduled to begin their championship campaigns the following weekend.[144] Longford's concession meant they surrendered an outside possibility of promotion and instead caused the promotion of Down.[145] Down's promotion was also assisted by the points secured following Leitrim's concession of their previous fixture.[146] On 21 October, it was reported that a Roscommon footballer had tested COVID-19 positive.[147] The team vowed to fulfil their fixture against Cavan, however.[148] On 22 October, Waterford GAA indicated it would concede its football fixture against Antrim due to the deteriorating health crisis north of the border.[149] Antrim suggested it instead concede home advantage and play the fixture in Dundalk, an offer which Waterford accepted.[150] Also on 22 October, the entire Offaly county hurling team were ruled as close contacts of a COVID-19 positive player they had trained alongside, forcing the county to concede that weekend's 2020 Christy Ring Cup game against Kildare.[151] On 23 October, Sligo GAA announced that a player on the Sligo county hurling team had tested COVID-19 positive, meaning the team could not play Derry in the Christy Ring Cup that weekend.[152] On 5 November, the Sligo county football team were forced to withdraw from the 2020 Connacht Senior Football Championship due to COVID-19, meaning their opponents Galway went straight into the final.[153] On 8 November, Mark Keane of Collingwood Football Club (one of several players whose return to Ireland during the close of the Australian rules football season coincided with the delayed All-Ireland and provincial competitions) was brought on as a substitute for Cork against Kerry in the 2020 Munster Senior Football Championship. He scored the late goal that knocked Kerry out of the competition, in what was described as \"one of the biggest upsets in recent championship history... a strike so late it had eerie echoes of Tadhg Murphy's 1983 goal at the same end of the ground that similarly put Kerry out of the championship\".[154] On 22 November, Colin O'Riordan (another of those who had returned to Ireland during the close of the Australian rules football season) played for Tipperary against Cork in the 2020 Munster Senior Football Championship Final, winning a senior provincial medal in his first game for his county in five years.[155] Sydney Swans also gave O'Riordan permission to play in the All-Ireland semi-final against Mayo.[156] Three members of the Mayo backroom team were each suspended for three months after attending the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final \"without accreditation\".[157][158] Both the Sam Maguire Cup and the Liam MacCarthy Cup, the premier football and hurling trophies, were withheld from 2020's winning teams to discourage crowds gathering and no homecoming celebrations were permitted.[159] Following a sudden reintroduction of restrictions (announced on Christmas Eve and taking effect after the public holiday), the inter-county minor and under-21 championships, specifically in Leinster and Ulster, came to a halt once more.[160] Roscommon did manage to win the Connacht Minor Football Championship on Saint Stephen's Day though, after Kerry had won the Munster Minor Football Championship.[161] 12 games at minor and under-20 level went unplayed in 2020.[162] The 2021 National Football League was regionalised to facilitate limited travel, with (for instance) Division 1 North consisting of Donegal, Tyrone, Monaghan and Armagh.[163] This plan had been hinted at as early as September 2020.[164] However, all games were indefinitely delayed due to the deteriorating health crisis south of the border in early 2021. It was decided in December 2020 that New York would return to the Connacht Senior Football Championship in 2022, rather than 2021, and decided on London's delayed return on 8 April 2021. Meaning that, in 2022, the Roscommon vs London and Galway vs New York games that would have been played in 2020 would be played in 2022. As the draws for the 2021 championships took place after the Roscommon vs New York and Mayo vs London games were called off, the games that were to have been played in 2021 would instead be played (possibly)[vague] in 2023.[citation needed]. Overseas travel in Gaelic games remain banned for the rest of 2021 but a possible return in 2022 will be decided during the months of October and November 2021 at the earliest. The delayed 2021 National Hurling League began on 8 May, while the National Football League began on 15 May. On 19 May, Wexford GAA's chairman told South East Radio that two members of the Wexford county hurling team, who had played in the league win over Clare at Cusack Park a few days earlier, had separately tested positive for COVID-19. This came ahead of the scheduled league fixture against Kilkenny that weekend, with betting suspended in some cases due to uncertainty over whether the game would occur and all the other Wexford hurlers being tested for COVID-19.[133][165] The Kilkenny game was postponed on 22 May after a third Wexford hurler tested positive for COVID-19 on 21 May, with public health advice referring to the possibility of the virus circulating among the other players.[166] The game was later rescheduled.[167] There were then doubts over the rescheduled fixture when a Kilkenny hurler tested positive for COVID-19 but the game went ahead.[168] Two of the Clare hurlers became involved in the original Wexford incident when identified as close contacts of the first two Wexford hurlers who had contracted COVID-19, leading to them being deemed ineligible for the team's next league match away to Laois at O'Moore Park.[169] As a result a dispute arose between Wexford GAA and the Clare hurling manager, Brian Lohan.[170] Clare GAA supported their manager.[171] On 27 May, Wexford GAA confirmed that none of its other players had since tested positive for COVID-19 and that training would recommence.[172] On 30 May, immediately after a four-point loss to Dublin in the last round of the 2021 National Football League in Tuam resulted in Galway having to contest a relegation play-off to stay in Division 1, Galway manager Pádraic Joyce expressed his annoyance upon learning that their opponent Monaghan would receive home advantage. \"I'm just after being told it is away because they had no home games and we had two home games \u2014 so they are being rewarded for breaking a curfew and I find that unbelievable\", Joyce said, in reference to the Séamus McEnaney-sanctioned COVID-19 breach which both the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee and the Garda Síochána had been alerted to the previous month. He added: \"It's a joke, if you ask me, and I don't know how Croke Park came up with that solution to play in Monaghan... I think it disrespects the whole system and the whole Allianz League if you are going rewarding a county to get a home vital game when you broke the rules\".[173] Monaghan won by a single point (scored in the 94th minute of the game) and Galway were relegated.[174] In July, meetings were held to move both the Connacht SFC Final from Castlebar and the Ulster SFC Final from Clones to Croke Park. The 2020 Sigerson Cup and 2020 Fitzgibbon Cup were both played to completion, two of the few competitions unaffected that year as they had been played in January and February.[175] On 13 January 2021, the GAA confirmed that the year's Sigerson and Fitzgibbon Cups had been cancelled due to pandemic restrictions.[176] Uncertain whether there be back in 2022. The final of the 2020 MacRory Cup, due to have been played between St Colman's College, Newry and St Patrick's College, Maghera on 17 March, was postponed.[177] After an unsuccessful effort to play the match on 7 October, the game was cancelled and the trophy shared between the finalists.[178] The 2020 Corn Uí Mhuirí was ? The 2020 Connacht Colleges Senior Football Championship was also abandoned. The 2020 Leinster Colleges Senior Football Championship was completed. The pandemic also affected the 2020\u201321 season, with (for instance) no schools or college games occurring during November 2020.[53] 14 January 2021 brought confirmation that the Hogan Cup and the Dr Croke Cup would not be played for in 2021, though the possibility of competitions at provincial level was retained.[179] The morning of 25 February 2021 brought confirmation that Munster post-primary school competitions would not occur in 2021.[180] Later that day, the other three provinces followed suit.[181] The UK government did not permit London GAA clubs to resume contact training until the evening of 25 August.[182] London, Warwickshire and Lancashire were excluded from the 2020 and 2021 All-Ireland Senior Football and Hurling Championships.[36] Irish players based in the Australian Football League (AFL), including Conor McKenna, returned home following the suspension of play there.[183] In addition, the AFL announced on 5 April that they would not be travelling to Ireland for the planned International Rules Series in November 2020 due to the disruption that the virus had caused to their season.[184] Conor McKenna returned to Melbourne when the 2020 AFL season resumed. On 20 June, McKenna became the sport's first COVID-19 case when he returned a low-level positive result. After a particularly negative reaction from the local media,[185][186] and a failure to replicate the initial result,[187] McKenna returned home and resumed his football career with Tyrone.[188] He made an immediate impact on his debut against Donegal and in his second game scored two goals that helped relegate Mayo, in what was that county's first time to be knocked out of the top flight in 23 years.[189][190] On 11 May, the Camanachd Association issued a statement that it had agreed in consultation with the GAA to cancel the 2020 Shinty-Hurling International Series between Ireland and Scotland, scheduled for October.[191] By May 2020, Gaelic games administrators in France (where most players\u2014particularly in Brittany\u2014are French natives and the French language is common) had concluded that, with the stricter lockdown in force there and the government's announcement that mass gatherings would not be permitted before September, their 2020 championship could not occur. The French finals had been scheduled for Bordeaux.[192] After the disruption of early 2021, clubs in England resumed full contact training in late March 2021 but clubs in Scotland and Wales had not joined them by then.[193] Meeting to return in 2022 for GAA overseas trips expected to take place on November 20th 2021 for the return for overseas trips and pre-season training.","Title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gaelic games - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10924","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_Gaelic_games"}
