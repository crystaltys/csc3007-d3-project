Since 1990, he had been the director of the Belarusian Independent Institute of \"Belrad\", created in 1989 with the help of Andrei Sakharov, Ales Adamovich and Anatoly Karpov. He attempted to warn the public of the dangerous radiation caused during the Chernobyl explosion. Because of his activities, he lost his job and got problems with the KGB.[3] Vassioy Nesterenko died on 25 August 2008 at the age of 73 and was survived by his son. Nesterenko intervened immediately after news of the accident in the nuclear power plant started to spread. As an expert on the subject and with his experience as a fire fighter, he threw liquid nitrogen containers from a helicopter on the burning reactor core. To do this he had to move into the middle of radioactive smoke. Despite the heavy radioactive contamination of the area, Nesterenko survived. However, of the four passengers of his helicopter, three died from radioactive irradiation and contamination.[4][page needed] In 1990 Nesterenko founded the Institute of Radiation Safety (BELRAD), which carries out \"radiation monitoring of the inhabitants of Chernobyl zone and their foodstuffs, development of measures on maintenance of radiation safety and protection of the population on territories, contaminated by radionuclides by realization of necessary scientific researches, development and organization of implementation of their results in practice.\"[5]","Title":"Vassili Nesterenko - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8740","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassili_Nesterenko"}
