{"Content: ":"Death from laughter is a supposedly extremely rare form of death, usually resulting from either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation, that has itself been caused by a fit of laughter. Instances of death by laughter have been recorded from the times of ancient Greece to modern times. Often, the phrase \"dying from laughter\" is used as hyperbole. Death may result from several pathologies that deviate from benign laughter. Infarction of the pons and the medulla oblongata in the brain may cause the pseudobulbar affect.[2] Asphyxiation caused by laughter leads the body to shut down from the lack of oxygen. Laughter can cause atonia and collapse (\"agelastic syncope\"),[3][4][5][6] which in turn can cause trauma. See also laughter-induced syncope, cataplexy, and Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Gelastic seizures can be due to focal lesions to the hypothalamus.[7] Depending upon the size of the lesion, the emotional lability may be a sign of an acute condition, and not itself the cause of the fatality. Gelastic syncope has also been associated with the cerebellum.[8]","Title":"Death from laughter - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12396","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter"}
