{"Content: ":"The Ukrainian Air Assault Forces (DShV, from \"Desantno-shturmovi viyska Ukrayiny\", Ukrainian: Десантно-штурмові війська України [ДШВ]; lit.\u2009'Air-Assault Forces of Ukraine'), known until 2017 as the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces (VDV, from \"Vysokomobil'ni desantni viyska Ukrayiny\", (Ukrainian: Високомобільні десантні війська України, ВДВ, lit.\u2009'High-mobile Airborne Forces of Ukraine')[6] are the airborne forces of Ukraine and one of the five branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Air Assault Forces are in constant combat readiness and are the high-mobility branch of the military, responsible for air assaults and military parachuting operations. Before the Russo-Ukrainian War they were also the main forces sent by Ukraine to peacekeeping missions around the world.[7] They are considered the elite of Ukraine's armed forces.[8] The Ukrainian Air Assault Forces were created in 1992 from units of the Soviet Airborne Troops (VDV) stationed on Ukrainian territory after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991. In the 15 years after their creation Ukrainian paratroopers have served in peacekeeping missions to the Balkans, in Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ethiopia, Georgia and DR Congo. In 2007, the 13th Separate Airmobile Battalion served as part of Polish\u2013Ukrainian Peace Force Battalion, a peacekeeping unit with Kosovo Force.[7] In August 2014 the 95th Air Assault Brigade conducted a raid behind the separatist lines. The 95th Brigade, which had been reinforced with armor assets and attachments, launched a surprise attack on separatist lines, broke through into their rear areas, fought for 450 kilometers, and destroyed or captured numerous Russian tanks and artillery pieces before returning to Ukrainian lines and established a corridor in which the Ukrainian army units and civilians trapped at the border could retreat. It was one of the longest armored raids in military history.[9] In 2016, the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces became an independent branch of the Armed Forces. Previously, they were part of Ground Forces.[10] On 21 November 2017 (Ukraine's Paratroopers' Day) President Petro Poroshenko stated that 469 Ukrainian paratroopers had been killed in the (ongoing) Russo-Ukrainian War.[11] On 21 November 2018 he adjusted this to 487 killed.[12] On 21 November 2017 the Air Assault Forces received its new insignia - the dome of a parachute \"as a symbol of airborne units around the world\" and the wings of Archangel Michael and \"the flaming sword with which he hits the enemies\".[11] The color of the Ukrainian paratroopers was changed to maroon.[11] 21 November 2017 was the first time Air Assault Forces Day in Ukraine was celebrated on 21 November.[3] Up to 2017 this day was celebrated on 2 August, as it was in the Soviet Union.[13][3] President Poroshenko said \u201cIt is logical to celebrate your professional holiday on November 21. The usual August 2 is the date of the first jump of paratroopers in the Moscow Military District. How is it about us? Moscow is not Kyiv. Ukraine is not Russia.\"[14] He added that \"The start of the new Paratroop Day is part of the Ukrainianization of the historical and political calendar - the replacement of the Soviet-Russian imposed upon us.\"[15] From 2017 onward, the UkrAAF wear the maroon berets common among many Western airborne units. Beginning Thursday, 24 February 2022, the day the Russian Armed Forces begun its invasion of the republic,[16] the UkrAAF have been participants of some of the land combat actions of the current conflict, fighting alongside their Ground Forces, Territorial Defense and National Guard brethren in arms. In 2014, the staffing of an airmobile brigade was brought up to 1,200 personnel. Each brigade was given at least one artillery battalion from the 25th and 55th artillery brigades and a tank battalion. Currently, the total staffing of the brigades ranges from 1,000 to 2,200 personnel, depending on the deployment. Most of the brigades operate in 1-2 battalion tactical groups, in each of which, in addition to infantry battalions, there are up to two artillery battalions and at least one tank company equipped with BTRs and BMPs. In 2001 the Airmobile Force consisted of:[17] A KRAZ Spartan A MTLB Soldiers prepare for movement during «Saber Junction-2018». Soldiers during «Saber Junction-2018».
