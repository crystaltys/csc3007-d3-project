{"Content: ":"Rustam Nurgaliyevich Minnikhanov (Russian: Руста́м Нургали́евич Минниха́нов, Tatar: Рөстәм Нургали улы Миңнеханов; born 1 March 1957) is a Russian politician who has served as the second President of Tatarstan, a federal subject of Russia, since 2010. He is also the deputy commander of the Central Military District of Russia,[2] with the rank of Major General.[1] Rustam Minnikhanov was born on March 1, 1957 in a Volga Tatar family in the New Arysh (Russian: Новый Арыш, romanized: Novyi Arysh; Tatar: Cyrillic Яңа Арыш, Latin Yaña Arysh) village of Rybno-Slobodsky District in the Tatar ASSR. He graduated from Kazan Agricultural Institute in 1978 as mechanical engineer and from Correspondence Institute of Soviet Trade as a commodity expert in 1986. He is a doctor of economic sciences.[3] After graduating from the institute in 1978, he began his career as an engineer in Sabinsky District Association of Selkhoztekhnika. He then worked in the district as a senior engineer and chief power engineer in a state timber industry enterprise and was deputy chairman of District Consumer Society Board. In 1985\u20131993 he worked in Arsky District as chairman of the District Consumer Society Board, Chairman of the Executive Committee of People's Deputies District Council, First Deputy Head of District Administration. In 1993 he was appointed head of Vysokogorsky District administration. In November 1996 Minnikhanov was appointed minister of finance of the Republic of Tatarstan. From July 10, 1998 until March 25, 2010 Minnikhanov was prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan.[3] As prime minister, he was known for his enthusiasm for technological innovation, spearheading the republic's move to digital, paperless government and the streamlining of official business through the use of electronically distributed documents and electronic signing of official documents.[4] On January 27, 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev nominated Minnikhanov to be the new president of Tatarstan[5] and on March 25, 2010, Minnikhanov formally assumed the office of President.[6] His ceremony was presented on Channel One Russia by Maxim Sharafutdinov. During the 2014 Crimean crisis, Minnikhanov acted as a mediator between the Kremlin government and the Crimean Tatar community over concerns raised amongst Crimean Tatars over potential persecution by Russia should it annex the peninsula.[7] On 5 March Minnikhanov signed an agreement on co-operation between Tatarstan and the Aksyonov government in Crimea that implied collaboration between ten government institutions as well as significant financial aid to Crimea from Tatarstan businesses.[8] On 11 March Minnikhanov was in Crimea on his second visit and attended as a guest in the Crimean parliament chamber during the vote on the declaration of sovereignty pending 16 March referendum.[8] On 13 March Putin made a comparison between Crimea and Kosovo in a phone call with US President Barack Obama.[9] The Tatarstan Mufti Kamil Samigullin invited Crimean Tatars to study in madrasas in Kazan, and declared support for their \"brothers in faith and blood\".[8] Following news of Crimea's independence referendum organized with the help of Russia on 16 March 2014, the Kurultai leadership voiced concerns of renewed persecution, as commented by a U.S. official before the visit of a UN human rights team to the peninsula.[10] At the same time, Minnikhanov was dispatched to Crimea to quell Crimean Tatars' concerns and to state that \"in the 23 years of Ukraine's independence the Ukrainian leaders have been using Crimean Tatars as pawns in their political games without doing them any tangible favors\". The issue of Crimean Tatar persecution by Russia has since been raised regularly on an international level.[11][12] On 18 March, the day Crimea was annexed by Russia, and Crimean Tatar was de jure declared one of the three official languages of Crimea. It was also announced that Crimean Tatars will be required to relinquish coastal lands on which they squatted since their return to Crimea in the early 1990s and be given land elsewhere in Crimea. Crimea stated it needed the relinquished land for \"social purposes\", since part of this land is occupied by the Crimean Tatars without legal documents of ownership.[13] The situation was caused by the inability of the USSR (and later Ukraine) to sell the land to Crimean Tatars at a reasonable price instead of giving back to the Tatars the land owned before deportation, once they or their descendants returned from Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan). As a consequence, some Crimean Tatars settled as squatters, occupying land that was not legally registered. On 20 April 2017 Minnikhanov was Putin's envoy to meet with candidate Ebrahim Raisi in Mashhad in Raisi's capacity as Head of Astan Quds Razavi. MP Alireza Rahimi questioned the meeting and asked for explanations about the reasons for it, citing alleged Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election. \u201cThe recent meeting raises the suspicion of interference in the elections, which is not appropriate\u201d, he said.[14][15] According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Minnikhanov also met vice president Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran one day earlier, discussing bilateral relations.[16] On 18 March 2022 Minnikhanov met and awarded 2022 European figure skating champion and provisional 2022 Olympic gold medallist Kamila Valieva a \u201cDuslyk\u201d order and to her mother Alsu Valieva a medal of \u201c100 years of the Establishment of TASSR\u201d. During his tenure as republican prime minister, Minnikhanov continued to be involved in industry, serving as chairman of the board of directors of the oil company Tatneft from 2005 to 2006.[17] In September 2021 Minnikhanov while still President of Tatarstan was elected chairman of the board of directors of aircraft manufacturer Tupolev.[18] Minnikhanov is married and fathered two sons.[3] His son Irek Minnikhanov died in the Tatarstan Airlines Flight 363 crash on November 17, 2013.[19] Minnikhanov is a keen motorsports enthusiast and was a regular competitor in the FIA European Championship for Rallycross Drivers, in 2007 driving a Citroën C4 T16 4x4 with 550+bhp that was built and raced in 2006 by 14-time European Rallycross champion Kenneth Hansen of Sweden. For the 2008 and 2009 ERX series Hansen's team built a brand new C4 for Minnikhanov. In 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006 Minnikhanov won the truck category of the UAE Desert Challenge (a Rally Raid competition) in the United Arab Emirates with his Kamaz 4911 and in 2004 as well as 2005 he finished 3rd overall in the FIA European Championship for Autocross Drivers with a four-wheel-driven Ford Puma.
