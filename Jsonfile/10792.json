He said, \u201cThe situation is improving and our experience with COVID-19 is [shifting] from a pandemic to endemic state.\" The plan was to update most statistics on Thursdays.[100] Source: Ohio dashboard, June 30, 2022.[14] Note: all data is preliminary and subject to change as more information is reported Acting on advice from Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton;[120] Governor DeWine was one of the first state governors to \"sound the alarm\" about the coronavirus threat, taking action before Ohio had any confirmed cases.[121] Axios called him \"among the leading governors in the country sounding the alarm about the threat of the coronavirus.\"[121] The Washington Post called his and Acton's response \"a national guide to the crisis\" and \"textbook recommendations,\"[122] pointing out numerous occasions when moves taken by Ohio were soon followed by other states.[123] The Hill said he'd \"been one of the most aggressive governors in responding to the pandemic\".[124] Prior to the state having any confirmed cases,[125] on March 3, DeWine made the decision to cancel the Arnold Classic, a move which The Washington Post noted as seeming \"radical\" at the time.[123][126] The estimated economic impact for the state was $53 million.[126] On March 5, when the state still had no confirmed cases, DeWine and Acton held a summit on COVID-19 preparedness for public health officials in the state.[127] DeWine declared a state of emergency on March 9, when the state had only three known cases.[128] That same day he asked colleges and universities to go to online classes.[129] Within days many colleges and universities had taken steps to comply. On March 12, DeWine announced that all schools from K-12 would close for a 3-week break, starting March 16;[130] he was the first governor to announce statewide school closings.[121] The Ohio Department of Education updated their guidelines for ensuring schoolchildren received meals, announcing that each district would make independent decisions about providing reduced and free breakfast and lunch to students during the break but encouraging districts to ensure needs were met and stating the department would continue to reimburse districts for meals served during the closure.[131] Also on March 12, Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton instituted a ban on gatherings of more than 100, with exemptions for airports, workplaces, restaurants, religious gatherings, weddings and funerals.[132] Despite having only thirteen confirmed cases at the time, Ohio officials were predicting that there were over 100,000 cases in the state.[133] Department of Health director Acton compared the small number of cases to \"seeing a star and knowing that light is a moment from the deep past\"[134] as she argued for Ohioans to take steps to prevent further infections that could overload the state's hospitals.[134] State Representative Emilia Sykes called Acton \"the real MVP of Ohio's coronavirus response.\"[134] DeWine and Acton on March 14 recommended Ohioans postpone elective surgeries.[135] DeWine and Acton ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants starting 9:00 PM EDT March 15, 2020, saying the government \"encouraged restaurants to offer carryout or delivery service\" but that they \"would not be allowed to have people congregating in the businesses.\"[132][136] DeWine said he was \"concerned that with St. Patrick's Day coming up Tuesday, people would ignore warnings and go out to bars.\"[137] Closing of the state's estimated 22,000 restaurants was expected to affect some 500,000 workers.[138] DeWine instituted a liquor buyback program[124] and expanded Ohio's unemployment insurance to cover laid-off restaurant workers. The state waived the qualifying waiting period as well as the requirement that individuals receiving jobless benefits must seek new employment. The action also was extended to workers who are under quarantine or those who work in health care.[139] DeWine announced his intention to close daycares and recommended parents remove their children from daycare if possible.[121] DeWine said of the closings:[121] Establishments can stay open for carry-out and delivery. What we can't have is people congregating and seated. Every day we delay, more people will die. If we do not act and get some distance between people, our health care system in Ohio will not hold up. The loss won't only be those impacted by COVID19, but the danger is also to everyone else who needs hospital care for other issues.\" Acton stressed the importance of \"flattening the curve\", saying:[140] When our hospital systems are overwhelmed, that means if you are having a birth that you are planning, if you are in a car accident and need your hospital, if you have a stroke or an MI, even if you never get coronavirus, people in this country can die from something other than coronavirus. On March 16, DeWine banned gatherings of more than 50 people and on March 17 he ordered that all elective surgeries be postponed;[141] controversially, the state government indicated that this included abortions.[142] On March 18, DeWine announced that 181 BMV locations will close until further notice.

The State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy approved restrictions on the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.[6] DeWine said that because of the economic fallout from the closures, the state would need to slow down the rate of spending...rather dramatically,\" announcing on March 23 a hiring freeze for the state, a freeze on new contract services, and a continuation of the freeze on state employee travel. He asked cabinet members to find budget cuts of 20%.[151] According to Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted, Ohio would at the request of the Trump administration desist from publicizing unemployment figures.[152] On March 24 Jim Bridenstine announced that a number of NASA facilities would be moved to stage 4 where non-critical infrastructure is closed, including the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, and the Plum Brook Station near Sandusky.[153] Acton on March 24 estimated that Ohio was 7 to 14 days behind New York state, which at the time was overwhelmed.[154] On March 26 Acton announced that 17, 316 Ohioans had been tested.[155] On March 27 Acton said the state was at that time expecting cases to peak in mid-May at 10,000 new cases per day.[156] On March 25, the Ohio General Assembly passed House Bill 197, which does many things, such as extending primary voting to April 28, banning water utilities from disconnecting service, and waiving standardized testing for public schools.[157][158] On March 28, DeWine asked the FDA to issue an emergency waiver for the use of new technology that can sterilize face masks.[159] On April 2, Governor DeWine announced during his daily press conference that there is a new method to divide the state into hospital capacity regions.[160] On April 3, DeWine extended Ohio's stay at home order through May 1 with new restrictions: campgrounds must close, all retail businesses must post signs limiting how many are allowed in at one time, and wedding receptions are limited to 10 people. The order also establishes a state board to evaluate what is and is not an essential business.[161] On April 4 Ohio recommended the wearing of cloth face masks when leaving home as a way to protect others.[162] DeWine signed an executive order removing training requirements for mental health and marriage counselors to make telehealth visits more easily accessible.[163] On April 6 DeWine named six facilities that will be converted into health care facilities if necessary: the Dayton Convention Center, the Duke Energy Center in Cincinnati, the Greater Columbus Convention Center, Seagate Convention Center in Toledo, Case Western Reserve University's Health Education Campus in Cleveland, and the Covelli Convention Center in Youngstown. Also on April 6, Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder named 24 lawmakers to a task force dedicated to studying how the House can speed up economic recovery.[164] On April 9 the Ohio Department of Health released a video demonstrating the effect of social distancing that went viral.[122][165] According to The Washington Post:[165] A video from the Ohio Department of Health shows a minefield of mousetraps and table tennis balls, row upon row, that turn into a predictable maelstrom of flying debris once a bouncing ball tumbles into view. It\u2019s also a metaphor for the menacing spread of the coronavirus, where just one person interacting with others can produce a chain reaction of devastating consequences. The video is among the clearest visualizations yet of how proximity can turn lethal \u2014 and, conversely, how isolation can turn the tide. In the second half of the video, the traps are spaced at greater distances as a table tennis ball bounces across the floor without triggering any hazards. On April 15, DeWine announced that he had asked the Ohio Hospital Association to begin developing a plan to start treating people whose non-COVID-19 elective procedures were deferred or delayed. DeWine also announced that Ohio's partnership with the Battelle Memorial Institute was expanding. This will allow the institute to extend its sterilization services to EMS providers and law enforcement agencies.[166] On April 16 DeWine announced that he would work closely with the Governors of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin to reopen the region's economy in a coordinated way.[167] The Ohio Department of Health establishes a tier system to prioritize testing on April 22.[168] Ohio: DeWine shares additional details on how the state will re-open. Phase one of the re-opening will begin on May 1.[169] On April 20, Governor DeWine announced that Ohio's K-12 schools would remain closed for the remainder of the academic year.[170] On April 30 DeWine and Acton amended the stay-at-home order and extended it to May 29, calling it the \"Stay Safe Order.\"[171] Some businesses were allowed to open on a limited basis, including dentists and veterinarians on May 1, manufacturing, distribution, construction, and general offices on May 4, with remote work if possible, and retail businesses on May 12 with employees and customers wearing masks.[171] On May 19 Governor DeWine announced an \"Urgent Health Advisory: Ohioans protecting Ohioans\" order.

He said National Guard units would be in the area to provide help with the testing.[174] On July 2, a four-level system was introduced for classifying the severity of outbreaks in individual counties. The system is based on seven metrics, including new cases and cases per-capita, cases in \"non-congregate\" environments, ICU bed occupancy, and sustained increases in hospital admissions. These classifications are updated on Wednesdays; as of its introduction, seven counties (Butler, Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton, Huron, Montgomery, and Trumbull counties) were listed in alert level 3, while Franklin County was marked as being at risk of entering alert level 4 \u2014 meaning that at least six of the metrics were showing signs of concern.[175][176][177] On July 8, DeWine announced that the wearing of face coverings in public would become mandatory in any county that is under alert level 3 or higher. This order applies in any enclosed public spaces, outdoors when social distancing is not possible, or when using public or private transport services.[178] On July 22, DeWine announced that this mask mandate would be extended state-wide beginning July 23 at 6:00 p.m.[179] In October, DeWine announced the formation of COVID-19 defense teams to fight the pandemic in each county. The teams are made of those in the medical field, mayors, religious leaders, and businesses.[180] On November 11, DeWine announced additions to the mask mandate, which include requiring businesses to post face covering requirement signs at all public entrances. A new order pertaining to public gatherings prohibits dancing and games and requires people to be seated and wear masks while eating.[181] On November 16, DeWine announced that he opposed a second shutdown, instead favoring a \"slow down.\" \u201cWe don\u2019t want to shut this state down,\u201d said DeWine. \u201cThat has ramifications for mental health, it has ramifications for more drug addiction, overdoses. I mean, all these things go up when you shut the state down. And we do not want to do that.\u201d A formal announcement on the slowdown was on Tuesday, November 17.[182] In the announcement, DeWine gave information on a new curfew, requiring retail businesses to close between 10:00 pm and 5:00 am.

The businesses allowed to reopen would be on this schedule:[191] The plan also listed those types of businesses that would not reopen, and a list of rules and guidelines, including mandatory face coverings worn at all times.[191] DeWine later reversed the order requiring people to wear face masks in businesses, saying that it \u201cwent too far.\"[192] On May 7, DeWine announced that on Friday, May 15, barbershops and salons may re-open.

They include: Vigilantly assessing for symptoms; Washing and sanitizing hands; Clean and sanitizing schools thoroughly; Social distancing; And implementing face covering policies.[202] In August, the Ohio Department of Health Director introduced a mask mandate for students in K-12 schools.[203] In the fall of 2020, school sports are allowed, but with limited spectators.[204] On September 23, DeWine issued an order allowing restaurants to fully open but with restrictions.[205] Relaxed visitations at nursing homes and assisted living facilities will be allowed starting October 12.[206] On January 26, Governor DeWine announced the criteria for lifting the 10 p.m. curfew.[207] On January 27, DeWine announced that, starting January 28, the stateside curfew would start at 11 p.m.[208] On February 11, the curfew was lifted.[209] On May 12, DeWine announced that all COVID health orders, including the mask mandate, would be lifted on June 2.[210] On May 14, DeWine announced that the remaining health orders would be updated to reflect changes in the CDC's guidelines.[211] Starting May 17, an amended health order allows fully vaccinated people to not wear masks.[212] On June 1, Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud signed an order rescinding several COVID-19-related health orders, including mask mandates. The rescissions went into effect on June 2.[213] On March 26 Acton said that the measures implemented in Ohio had decreased the impact on the state's healthcare system by 50 to 75%.[155][126] On March 27, Acton projected Ohio cases to peak in mid-May at 10,000 per day.[156] By the first week in April, crediting Ohioan's compliance with social distancing requests, she had revised the projection to mid-to-late April or early May.[214] On April 8, Acton said that the effectiveness of physical distancing being incorporated into modeling led to a revised projection of a new peak of 1,600 new cases per day in late April.[215] The Washington Post on April 9 said Ohio \"was realizing the benefits of early intervention in the pandemic by its government and medical community,\" with fewer than 1/3 as many cases and \"a small fraction of the deaths\" as Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, all nearby comparably-sized states.[122] On October 24, President Trump held a campaign rally at the Pickaway County Fairgrounds in Circleville. \"The seats were just inches apart in rows spaced less than 3 feet apart. The many more standees were packed closely together. The use of face masks was sporadic at best.\" President Trump told the crowd, \u201cIt\u2019s going away, it\u2019s rounding the turn.\u201d[216] However, according to WBNS-TV in Columbus, \"cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions ... [had] increased in recent weeks.\"[217] An amended health order signed in April mandates six feet of separation between tables at eating establishments that are not separated by physical barriers. The new order also states that social distancing, congregating, and capacity requirements do not apply to First Amendment activity and religious observances.[218] While multiple media outlets praised DeWine and Acton's orders, a group of 75 protested the restrictions on nonessential workers outside the Statehouse during their April 9 press conference.[219] Another protest was staged April 13, reporters commenting that the protesters could be heard and were \"pounding on the windows\" during the press conference.[220] On April 14, 100 protesters gathered at the Statehouse during DeWine's press conference.[221] On April 18 several hundred protesters again assembled at the Statehouse.[222] Two men at the protest had a sign with anti-semitic imagery, showing a rat wearing a yarmulke and a Star of David with the caption, \"The real plague.\"[223] Protests continued on April 20 with hundreds gathering outside the Statehouse.[224] On May 1, another large protest occurred during DeWine's press conference.[225] Protests at the statehouse continued the next day.[226] On April 16, 2020, a Columbus bridal shop owner, represented by the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, sued Acton for violating the shop owner's constitutional rights because of the stay-at-home order provided \"no meaningful post-closure process built into it to determine whether a business is 'essential' and can re-open\" and asking that the court for a \"temporary restraining order that requires the state to provide an immediate hearing for a business closed by the government, in which officials must specifically say why a business is not essential.\"[227] In late April, 32 Ohio state representative Republicans called for DeWine to reopen the state's economy completely on May 1.[228] In August, several Republicans filed an impeachment resolution that alleges that Dewine: gave Ohio's health department overly broad leeway to issue COVID-19 guidelines; \"conspired\" with the Ohio secretary of state to delay the March primary; and forced businesses to close, leading to a major economic slowdown.[229] On September 28, Representative John Becker filed to have criminal charges brought against DeWine for his response to COVID-19. The criminal charges include engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, complicity, terrorism, making terroristic threats, inducing panic, conspiracy, bribery, interfering with civil rights, coercion, and patient abuse or neglect.[230][231] On September 8, attendees at a Women for Trump event in Westerville featuring South Dakota Governor Christie Noem criticized Ohio Governor DeWine's handling of the pandemic. Noem, whose state had a 22% positivity rate, \"described how she disdained a push by state health officials to require masks, limit business activities and take other actions to halt the spread of COVID-19.\"[232] The Ohio Democratic Party questioned whether Noem had followed \"the guidance of Mike DeWine\u2019s health department\" requiring self-quarantine for 14 days for visitors from states with high positivity.[233] On September 21, at a Trump campaign rally in Swanton, Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted urged rally attendees to wear masks and was booed by the crowd.[234][235] Governor DeWine was received with a mixture of cheers and boos.[236] President Trump's speech described the disparate impact of the virus on the elderly and on the young, saying: \"It affects elderly people. Elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that\u2019s what it really affects. That\u2019s it.\" He concluded, \"Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system. But it affects virtually nobody. It\u2019s an amazing thing.\" The use of the phrase \"it affects virtually nobody,\" on a day when Ohio had reached a total of over 9,318 cases among children, prompted criticism of the President's rhetoric on the virus.[237][238][239][240] On October 21, in an interview in The Hill, an Ohio farmer described how his advocacy group, Rural America 2020, is putting up billboards that read \u201cTrump COVID superspreader event\u201d with an arrow near campaign rallies. He said, \"super spreader events ... are scaring the dickens out of folks in rural areas.\"[241] Ohio's 2020 primary elections were scheduled to be held Tuesday, March 17. DeWine, Acton, and Secretary of State Frank LaRose held an afternoon press conference on Monday, March 16 to cover precautions being taken for the next day's primary election.[140] LaRose issued an order to county boards of election allowing curbside voting.[140] DeWine recommended pushing the primaries into June[242] but did not think he had the authority to change the date.[243] DeWine and LaRose sought a court order to close down the elections, having former Ohio Department of Aging Director Judith Brachman file a suit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas to delay the election, but Judge Richard A. Frye denied it, saying it would set a \"terrible precedent\" and would represent a judge rewriting election code hours before an election.[243] Acton, who according to the Columbus Dispatch \"has enormous powers during a health emergency\", eventually announced at 10:08 pm that polls would be closed as a \"health emergency.\"[243][244] DeWine announced that LaRose would \"seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.\"[244] Acting on behalf of a candidate for a Wood County Common Pleas judgeship, Corey Spiewak, Perrysburg attorney Andy Mayle filed a suit in the Ohio Supreme Court to overturn Acton's action.[245] The court ordered the state to respond to the suit by 1:30 am Tuesday, saying that \"Due to exigent circumstances, this matter will be decided on the complaint and answer. No requests or stipulations for extension of time shall be filed, and the clerk of the court shall refuse to file any requests or stipulations for extension of time.[246] Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and Solicitor General Benjamin M. Flowers filed an answer on behalf of LaRose.[247] A decision denying the writ was issued by four justices.[248] The three who did not participate in the decision were Judith French and Sharon Kennedy, both of whom were running for re-election, and Pat DeWine, who is the governor's son.[246] In late March Battelle Labs in Columbus developed a technology to sterilize N95 masks for reuse, intending to provide 160,000 masks per day in Ohio and to send sterilizing machines to other areas of the US.[249] On March 29 the FDA approved the technology for limited use of up to 10,000 sterilizations per day.[249] DeWine issued a press release condemning this decision that afternoon.[249] Later on March 29, the FDA changed their position, and allowed full use of the technology.[250][251] Amish businesses switched to producing face masks and shields.[252] Berlin Gardens in Millersburg, normally a maker of garden furniture, was producing 100,000 face shields per day by April 10.[252] Gojo Industries announced that it would prioritize hospitals and first responders for its Purell hand sanitizer.[253] On September 9, trials for an potential COVID-19 vaccine at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center were put on hold because a UK participant developed an unexplained illness.[254] The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, was going into clinical trials for 30,000 participants worldwide, with 500 participants at the Ohio State location.[255] According to Acton, as of March 24 Ohio had 3600 ICU beds and would need to increase that capacity by 50%.[154][256] In Ohio about 26% of patients require hospitalization and about 11% need intensive care.[154][256] As of March 24, Ohio hospitals were at 60% of capacity.[154] In southwest Ohio, hospital executives said they could increase capacity by 20% to 50%.[257] Acton said on March 24 that Ohio was converting anesthesia machines to respirators, considering which other buildings could be converted into makeshift hospitals, and determining how to safely reuse personal protective equipment such as masks.[154] On October 15, it was reported that regional oubreaks had strained the hospital system in Lima.[258] The coronavirus pandemic affected abortion, employment, education, religion, the restaurant industry, sports, public transportation, and prisons in Ohio. On March 17, after Acton issued an order prohibiting nonessential surgeries to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE),[259] DeWine said abortions should be included except when the pregnant woman's life is at risk.[260] Deputy Attorney General Jonathan Fulkerson sent letters to three abortion providers to compel them to comply with the state ban on nonessential medical procedures. District Court Judge Michael Barrett ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood on April 1, ordering a two-week suspension of the ban.[261] The State of Ohio appealed Barrett's decision and asked him to put a hold on his order until the appeal was decided, which he declined to do. State of Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost later clarified that all medical abortions were still allowed, and that \"doctors remain free to perform surgical abortions necessary for a mother's health or life, and also surgical abortions that cannot be delayed without jeopardizing the patient's abortion rights.\"[259] On April 6, the State's request for an appeal was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.[262] On March 10 DeWine asked colleges and universities to go to remote classes.[129] Within several days many private and public colleges and universities had announced campus closings and a move to online classes.[263][264][265][266] On March 12 DeWine closed all K-12 schools starting March 16.[130] On March 30 he extended those closings to May 1.[267] On April 20, he ordered that all K-12 schools in the state remain closed for the rest of the 2019\u20132020 academic year [268] On May 6, Governor DeWine announced a $775 million budget reduction over the next two months. Spending on K-12 schools will be reduced by $300 million. Spending on other education will be reduced by $55 million and higher education spending will be reduced by $110 million.[269] On December 30, DeWine announced that he would extend the curfew until January 23. He also announced that schools would be allowed to resume full in-person learning on March 1. Students will be required to wear masks and social distance.[185] DeWine also announced new looser guidelines for schools. COVID-19-exposed student are no longer required to quarantine at home, unless masking and social distancing cannot be enforced.[270][271] NPR reported on March 24 that \"Almost 140,000 people filed for unemployment benefits in Ohio last week compared with fewer than 5,000 a week earlier.\"[272] On April 7, when asked about delays in the filing, Lieutenant Governor Husted said over 500 additional employees had been hired to process applications, bringing the number of employees of Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services to 829 employees.[214] On April 8, the National Guard arrived at Elkton Federal Prison in Columbiana County to assist the medical staff when a large number of prisoners became ill with the virus.[273] On April 18, the National Guard and Highway Patrol arrived at the state prison in Marion county to assist with \"mission critical functions\" after infections of correctional workers and prisoners.[274] By April 19, over 1800 prisoners at Marion Correctional Institution, approximately 3/4ths of the population, plus 100 staff had tested positive.[275] Overall the prison system had almost 2500 cases by April 19, representing almost a fifth of Ohio's cases.[275] On April 20 Acton said the prison testing results were indicating that as many as 70% of cases may be asymptomatic.[276] On April 22, the Marion County prison was the top hotspot for the virus in the country, and the Pickaway Correctional Institution was second-ranked. Marion County was first in cases per capita in the nation, while Pickaway County was fourth.[277] The Ohio prison system is designed to hold about 35,000 inmates but held about 49,000 in April 2020.[278] On April 22, federal judge James S. Gwin ordered Elkton prison to identify vulnerable inmates and transfer them from the facility. He ordered officials to \"evaluate each subclass member's eligibility for transfer out of Elkton through any means, including but not limited to compassionate release, parole or community supervision, transfer furlough or non-transfer furlough within two weeks.\" He noted, \u201cwith the shockingly limited available testing and the inability to distance inmates, COVID-19 is going to continue to spread, not only among the inmate population but also among the staff.\" He condemned the Federal Department of Corrections, asking \"Why has the Justice Department allocated Elkton an entirely insignificant number of tests while Ohio has been able to pull off mass testing across not only Marion but at multiple institutions?\"[279] On May 19, Gwin ordered federal prison officials to begin the process of releasing eligible inmates at Elkton into home confinement for health and safety reasons. He said that \u201cby thumbing their nose at their authority to authorize home confinement, (prison officials) threaten staff and they threaten low-security inmates.\u201d By that date, nine inmates had died from COVID-19. He ordered the release of 837 medically vulnerable prisoners, (those 65+ or with pre-existing conditions), to home confinement, compassionate release, or to provide detailed reasons for the denial. He also chided the prison for slow progress in testing, noting that \"despite the obvious need for rapid implementation for mass testing across the entire institution, they are only conducting tests on Mondays and Tuesdays.\"[280] The Marshall Project reported May 28, 2021 that 135 state prisoners had died by that date, a rate of 28 per 100,000 prisoners. They reported 9,833 infections by that date, a rate of 20,100 per 100,000. 4,932 staff tested positive, and 10 died by the same date.[281] In early March, as the pandemic began affecting Columbus, the city's public transit ridership began dropping, approximately 40 percent. Its public transit agency COTA began by introducing thorough cleaning measures, followed by reducing several rush-hour services on March 17. On March 19, it suspended fare collection, making all rides temporarily free, and required passengers to board and depart buses from the rear doors. On the same day, it also modified all rush-hour lines and suspended its AirConnect and Night Owl services. On March 20, the agency recommended only using its services for essential travel; two days later it shut down several rush-hour services and reduced frequencies of nine crosstown lines. On March 24, it stopped all rush-hour services until further notice.[282] On March 26, the agency began \"dynamic service\" to pick up customers left at bus stops by too-full buses; the agency's current policy is for a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.[283] By April 11, the Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority began requiring riders to wear face coverings.[284] The bishops of the Catholic Conference of Ohio suspended all public Masses in Ohio beginning March 16, dispensing with the obligation to attend Sunday Mass initially through Easter.[285][286][287] On April 28, the suspension of mass and dispensation was extended through May 29.[288] On May 8, the bishops announced the resumption of daily public Masses on May 25, with the dispensation continuing indefinitely.[289] The Genoa Baptist Church of Westerville, Ohio switched to a drive-in format.[290] The Bishop of the East Ohio Conference of the United Methodist Church urged the temporary closing of Methodist churches.[291] Ohio's Amish steering committee advised all church districts to heed the state's orders against gatherings of more than 10, telling Amish \u201dto cancel or postpone weddings, youth and family gatherings until further notice.\u201d[252] The closing of restaurants and bars affected 22,000 restaurants across the state and 500,000 workers.[292] In March 2020 a group of Cincinnati restaurateurs called on the federal government to provide a $225 billion bailout to the US restaurant industry.[293] Most of state's sports teams were affected. Several leagues began postponing or suspending their seasons starting 12 March. Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training on that date, and on March 16, they announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, affecting the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds.[294] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, affecting the Cleveland Cavaliers.[295] In the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time, affecting the Columbus Blue Jackets.[296] In college sports, the National Collegiate Athletic Association cancelled all winter and spring tournaments, most notably the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, affecting colleges and universities statewide.[297] On March 16, the National Junior College Athletic Association also canceled the remainder of the winter seasons as well as the spring seasons.[298] The Summit Motorsports Park announced they would ignore the stay-at-home order on April 16, and reopen for the 2020 season.[299][300] At a panel held at the Ohio House of Representatives, the owner of the park testified his beliefs that the shutdown of businesses was more for political reasons than for health reasons, and that there was a nationwide mandate to mark every fatality in the United States of America as being caused by COVID-19.[301][302] On May 20, the Eldora Speedway owned by Tony Stewart, announced one of its largest events of the season would be rescheduled to June 2021 in accordance with the ongoing restrictions on mass gatherings and spectator sports at large venues.[303] A decision on the dirt track's other major events was not announced.","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10792","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Ohio"}
