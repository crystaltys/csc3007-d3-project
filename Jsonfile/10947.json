{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The origins of the virus have subsequently led to an increase in acts and displays of Sinophobia, as well as prejudice, xenophobia, discrimination, violence, and racism against people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent and appearance around the world. With the spread of the pandemic and formation of hotspots, such as those in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, discrimination against people from these hotspots has been reported.[1][2][3] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Zika virus, but in 2015, the World Health Organization introduced recommendations to avoid this practice, to reduce stigma. In accordance with this policy, the WHO recommended the official name \"COVID-19\" in February 2020.[4] In early coverage of the outbreak, some news sources associated the virus with China in a manner that contributed to stigma. The journal Nature later published an apology for this type of coverage.[4][5] However, even after the majority of politicians had switched to avoiding stigmatizing language when referring to the virus, a minority continued.[4] Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[6][7] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.[8] As of late April 2020, Paris had seen riots break out over police treatment of marginalised ethnic groups during the then in-place lockdown.[9] Racism and xenophobia towards southern and south east Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[10][11][12] In China, some people of African descent were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.[13] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by some foreign governments, diplomatic corps, and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.[14] The US embassy in Yaound√© issued a travel warning to US citizens amid reports of \"... verbal and online harassment, stone throwing, and banging on vehicles occupied by expatriates\". Some residents of Cameroon thought that Europeans and Americans brought COVID to Africa.[15] According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo, store clerks have been hesitating to serve Japanese customers, and \"corona\" has also become a new slur with which to abuse Japanese people on the street.[16] On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested after a viral video showing the driver forcibly removing his Chinese passenger at a highway in Cairo's Maadi district on suspicion of having the virus. In the video, a voice is heard in the video jokingly shouting \"The first coronavirus case in Egypt!\" and the same voice then tells the driver \"May God support you, Hajji! Throw him out!\". The incident has sparked outrage among Egyptians after the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel and expressed an apology to him for the incident, widely condemned in the local media as an act of bullying and racism.[17][18] Violence towards foreigners has been reported amidst the pandemic, with some locals attacking foreigners on social media by publishing photos of them and linking them to the coronavirus. The Foreign Correspondents Association of Ethiopia had warned that \"dangerous rumours\" and \"vicious posts\" were being spread on the internet about foreign journalists, while other foreigners had been physically attacked.[19] A video reportedly recorded in Kibera, Kenya in March 2020 shows an angry crowd threatening a man and a woman of East Asian descent about the coronavirus. A man in the crowd shouts at the frightened couple, \"You are corona!\" A motorcycle rider from the crowd later raised his hand threatening to slap the Asian man. Growing unease towards Chinese immigrants has been reported in the streets of Nairobi and its environment especially towards construction workers.[20] An alleged Kenyan member of parliament posted in a Facebook message that his constituents had the right to stone and chase away any Chinese visitors who were not quarantined.[21] A Kenyan taxi driver told the BBC that Chinese nationals had been changing their usernames on taxi hailing apps to avoid their passenger requests being declined.[22] Geopolitical analyst Ovigwe Eguegu[23] reported that \"a plethora of conspiracy theories, and videos of Asians (some Chinese) eating bats, and other exotic animals\" on Nigerian social media has led to increased Sinophobia.[24] An ethnic Chinese man in Johannesburg told Deutsche Welle that violent comments such as \"wipe the Chinese people out\" and \"hope this virus gets all of them\" have been expressed in the country by locals.[25] Additionally, one of the earliest reactions of the South African government with regard to COVID-19 prevention was to build a forty-kilometer (25 mi) fence on the border with Zimbabwe. This action was intended to \"ensure that no undocumented or infected persons cross into the country\", according to Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille.[26] In February 2021, the Director of The Jesuit Institute South Africa, Father Russell Pollitt, criticized as potentially xenophobic Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize's announcement that COVID-19 vaccine distribution would be limited to only South African citizens.[27] The Bangladeshi government has sent dozens of Rohingya refugees, who had remained stranded at sea for several weeks, to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited island in the estuary of the Meghna river. Hundreds more remain stranded on two overcrowded trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. Human rights groups have criticised the Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments for using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to send away refugees.[28] There have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying \"people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcome here.\"[29] Many hotels and guesthouses refrained from people who had addresses in Wuhan.[30] Multiple hotels purportedly refused to check-in a Wuhan tour guide after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province.[31] In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded thirty face masks.[32] It was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check.[29] One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, \"are they really my countrymen?\" which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus.[31] Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.[33][34] On 1 April, three Americans cut in line at a medical facility in Qingdao, Shandong province. When confronted, one American claimed that there were eight million Chinese in America and that he would tell them all to get out. The three Americans were allowed to skip the line and the staff told the ones who confronted them that it was their way of showing respect to foreigners.[35] In March and April 2020, media outlets reported instances of xenophobia towards foreigners,[36] although according to The Globe and Mail on 10 April, Chinese officials denied the existence of any such discrimination within China.[37] It has been attributed to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, although the Chinese vice-foreign minister noted that ninety percent of imported COVID-19 cases were PRC nationals returning from overseas.[38][39] According to The Telegraph, foreigners are being barred from hotels, supermarkets, and restaurants, while others have had their visas cancelled and reentry into China barred.[40] The Guardian reported on 29 March of foreigners being shouted at by local residents, avoided in public places, and sometimes scolded as \"foreign trash\".[41] Shanghaiist has referenced stories of foreigner misbehaviour circulating on the Chinese internet as playing a role in the increased xenophobia.[42] A comic posted on Weibo depicts people in hazmat suits disinfecting foreigners and throwing them in waste bins.[43] In April 2020, several reports emerged in Guangzhou of African nationals being evicted from their homes by local police and told to leave, with no place to sleep, amidst some recent Chinese news articles negatively reporting on Nigerians in the city.[44][45] The reports of discrimination created controversy in Africa damaging Sino-African relations,[46][47][48] and sparked a diplomatic crisis, with African governments and diplomats speaking out against the incidents in Guangzhou.[49] The Nigerian legislator Oloye Akin Alabi posted a video of his confronting the PRC's ambassador Zhou Pingjian over the alleged mistreatment of Nigerians in the city. The governments of Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda have also asked for explanations from the PRC government, and the African Union Commission invited the PRC ambassador to the African Union to discuss the mistreatment allegations.[50] The African ambassadors summarised the complaints in an official protest letter demanding the cessation of reported ejection from hotels or apartments, forced testing and quarantine, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation of Africans particularly in the Guangdong province.[51] In response, Chinese authorities issued measures discouraging Guangzhou businesses and rental houses from refusing people based on race or nationality and encouraged foreigners to report discrimination to a 24-hour hotline.[52][53] Some locals coordinated food donations and listed available hotels online to African residents.[54] China initially placed land mines in selected regions along its border with Myanmar, which were later replaced by a barbed wire fence along 1000 km of the Myanmese border, for the stated goal of reducing cross-border COVID-19 infections. Other government sources suggested that pandemic restrictions were secondary to a desire to block the transmission of foreign ideas across the once-porous border region, citing a desire to specifically restrict the flow of Christianity and Buddhism into China.[55] More than a hundred restaurants in Hong Kong have turned away customers from mainland China, with one restaurant demanding that a customer produce a Hong Kong identity card to prove they were not from the mainland.[56] Tenno Ramen, a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hung Hom, refused to serve mainland Chinese customers. The restaurant said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us.\"[57] Another example is Kwong Wing Catering, a pro-2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests restaurant chain, which announced on Facebook on 28 January 2020 that it would serve only English- or Cantonese-speaking customers (no Mandarin-speakers customers allowed) since the government did not implement a border closure against mainland China. However, Mandarin is also the common tongue in Taiwan, so the said Facebook post was then updated a day later to clarify that they welcome Taiwanese customers.[58][59] Many protesters in Hong Kong have reportedly insisted on calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese Virus\" or \"Chinese coronavirus\".[60] Expats and South Asian minorities have also faced increased xenophobia, with media narratives blaming them as more likely to spread the virus.[61][62] The Foreign Policy reported that \"On social media, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram posts encourage people to stay away from places where Chinese citizens or Chinese-heritage Indonesians work and live. ... Major media outlets are also complicit in spreading anti-Chinese conspiracies.\"[63] Several Indonesian Muslims online have also linked the virus with China's mistreatment of Uighur Muslims, and that it is \"an azab (punishment) from Allah\".[64] A demonstration was staged outside a hotel in Bukittinggi, rejecting the visit of tourists from Southern China who stayed there amid fear of coronavirus. The demonstrators demanded that the tourists be isolated in an airport, and displayed distrust over screening tools in airports. It ended after police guaranteed that the tourists would stay in the hotel up to the following day, when the tourists depart from the city.[65][66] In a press release, the embassy of Japan in Indonesia said incidents of discrimination and harassment toward Japanese people had increased in the midst of the pandemic, and announced they had set up a help center to assist Japanese residents dealing with these incidents.[67] In general, there have been reports of widespread anti-Japanese discrimination and harassment in the country, with hotels, stores, restaurants, taxi services and more refusing Japanese customers, and many Japanese people were no longer allowed in meetings and conferences. The embassy of Japan has also received at least a dozen reports of harassment toward Japanese people in just a few days.[68][69] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan) said anti-Japanese discrimination was on the increase in the country.[70] People from Northeastern India have reportedly faced increased discrimination and harassment due to their \"Chinese\" appearance.[71] Northeast Indian students in Kirori Mal College, Delhi, have filed a complaint to college authorities about harassment in the hands of other students over the fears of coronavirus.[72] Eight students from Northeast India at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai also alleged that they were subjected to racism and harassment.[73] A survey by The Takshashila Institution found that 52.8% of Indian respondents felt terms such as \"Chinese Virus\" and \"Made in China Pandemic\" were not racist or stigmatising to the country.[74] The Bharatiya Janata Party's State unit president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had \"destroyed nature\" and \"that's why the God took revenge against them.\" The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling them \"erroneous\".[75] In March 2020, foreigners from Europe, US and Israel started facing xenophobia and discrimination, including evictions from rented homes.[76] Muslim gatherings organised by the Tablighi Jamaat has resulted in large increased of cases in India,[77] which has triggered Islamophobic reactions and increased communal tension.[78][79] Islamophobic hashtags began circulating shortly after the news broke in late March,[80] and a wave of anti-Muslim violence was reported in April.[81] In Jharkhand, hospitals refusing to treat Muslim patients because coronavirus-related Islamophobia have led to the deaths of at least two newborn babies.[82] There have been a few reports of increased anti-Christian violence and discrimination amidst the coronavirus lockdown.[83][84][85] The Iranian government has blamed the country's outbreak on the \"Zionists\". The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Iran has claimed that Israel released the virus as a form of biological warfare. These claims were seen to be antisemitic by American academic Walter Russell Mead[86] and some Jewish organisations, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[87] According to the Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japanese people have been denied entry to restaurants and experienced increased abuse since the pandemic.[88] More than 1,000 South Korean tourists were instructed to avoid public places and remain in isolation in their hotels.[89] The Israeli military announced its intention to quarantine some 200 South Korean nationals to a military base.[90] Many of the remaining South Koreans were rejected by hotels and were forced to spend nights at Ben Gurion Airport.[91] An Israeli newspaper subsequently published a Korean complaint that \"Israel is Treating [Korean and other Asian] Tourists Like Coronavirus\".[92] Public health expert Dr. Hagai Levine said Israeli politicians may be overreaching to impress voters.[93] On 14 March 2020, an Indian man from the Bnei Menashe community was attacked and beaten by two Israeli men in Tiberias who called him \"Chinese\" and shouted \"Corona\" during the attack.[94] The man was hospitalized at the Baruch Padeh Medical Center in Tiberias.[94] In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan had been trending on Twitter;[95] furthermore, on Twitter, Japanese people have called Chinese tourists \"dirty\", \"insensitive\", and \"bioterrorists\".[96] A server at a restaurant in Ito, a Japanese city on the Izu Peninsula south of Tokyo, was recorded shouting at a tourist \"China!

In response to the tweet, people who perceived it as racism launched a petition to demand Onoda's resignation from the Diet on Change.org.[101] In March 2020, a Korean working in Jordan since 2014 reported to the police that he was beaten and mocked because he was suspected of having the COVID-19 virus.[102] An incident of a Korean working in Jordan, who was not allowed into a taxi for similar reasons was also reported.[103] According to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there have been incidents of Japanese people in Jordan being chased by locals since the pandemic started.[88] In February 2020, a conflict broke out between ethnic Kazakhs and Chinese Muslims. According to The Diplomat, \"In the hours following the incident, fake news about 'ruthless pogroms in Kazakhstan around the spreading of coronavirus' circulated around social media, fueling hysteria in other parts of the country.\"[104][105] To address the deficit in the capacity at Kuwaiti hospitals to help in the COVID-19 outbreak, Kuwaiti actress Hayat Al-Fahad called for the deportation of migrant workers or to \"throw them in the desert\".[106][10] Her comments generated both outrage and support on social media in Kuwait.[106] A petition in Malaysia calling for citizens from China to be banned from entering the country claimed that the \"new virus is widely spread throughout the world because of their unhygenic lifestyle\".[107] The petition was reportedly signed by just over 250,000 people within a week.[108] Islamophobia also occurs since March when social media users insult groups of Tabligh people as the cluster related to Sri Petaling Tabligh gathering cause it to experiencing sudden jump in number of cases in Malaysia.[109] According to Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, more than 700 foreign migrant workers and refugees including stateless Rohingya refugees have been detained by Malaysian police during the coronavirus pandemic.[110] Police have claimed that the arrests were intended to prevent undocumented migrants from traveling to other areas as part of lockdown movement restrictions.[111] In response to the arrests, the United Nations in Malaysia's Head of Communications and Advocacy, Ahmad Hafiz Osman, to avoid detaining refugees and not to hinder them from seeking medical treatment. The Home Affairs Minister Hamzah Zainuddin had earlier described the Rohingya as \"illegal immigrants\", who \"have no status, right and basis to present any demands to the government\".[112][111] In addition, there have been incidents of xenophobia against Rohingya refugees in Malaysia, such as Malaysian politicians and locals expressing violent hate speech online,[113][114] accusing the Rohingya of committing crimes and dominating parts of the capital Kuala Lumpur. Names and photos of activists have been circulated on social media, and there have been several online petitions calling for the deportation of Rohingya on Change.org. This surge in hostility has been fueled by negative perceptions about Rohingya refugees and inflammatory news stories on social media.[111][115] According to The Star newspaper, there were also reports of Rohingya individuals making racially-tinged and provocative comments in social media videos targeting the Malay ethnicity community, which have strained relations between the two ethnic communities.[116] Rohingya community spokespersons have said the community is living in state of fear while the NGOs Mercy Malaysia and the Malaysian Relief Agency urged the public to show empathy and mercy towards the refugees during Ramadan.[115] On 11 May 83, human rights and civil society organisations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Article 19, and the International Committee of Jurists called on Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to address online hate speech and violent threats against Rohingya refugees.[117] On 21 June, Malaysian human rights NGO Aliran raised concerns about the living and working conditions of foreign migrant workers, many of whom had become infected with COVID-19.

The City Hall does not recognise identity cards issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This ruling was criticised by Yemen Refugee Union representative Dr Mohammed Al Radhi and Alliance of Chin Refugees coordinator James Bawi Thang Bik as discriminatory and inhumane towards refugee communities.[119] On 27 June, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia could not accommodate more Rohingya refugees due to a struggling economy and dwindling resources. Malaysia does not recognise their refugee status and has turned away incoming boats and detained hundreds of refugees. The Prime Minister also called upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to speed up the resettlement of Rohingya refugees in third party countries.[120][121] In early July 2020, an Al Jazeera documentary titled \"Locked Up in Malaysia's Lockdown\" alleged that illegal migrants and foreign workers had subjected to racism and mistreatment by Malaysian authorities during the country's lockdown. The Malaysian Government criticised the documentary as \"misleading\" and \"inaccurate\", with Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob demanding an apology from the news network. The Royal Malaysian Police have launched an investigation into the documentary while the Immigration Department of Malaysia have sought to question a Bangladeshi migrant interviewed in the documentary.[122][123][124] In response, several civil society organisations including the Centre for Independent Journalism issued a statement calling on the Malaysian Government to cease intimidating media and to protect the rights of migrant workers.[125] The Bangladeshi migrant, who was identified as Mohammad Rayhan Kaybir, was subsequently deported to Bangladesh on 22 August.[126] On 1 March 2020, a Palestinian mother with her daughter chanted \"corona, corona\" to the two Japanese women who were in Ramallah for non-governmental aid mission.[127][128] The mother then attacked and pulled the hair of one of the Japanese women who attempted to record the incident.[129] According to the Embassy of Japan, there have been at least another ten reports of anti-Japanese incidents related to the pandemic, as of early March.[88] Various Filipino-Chinese advocacy groups have warned that racism against the Chinese community has risen after the outbreak has started.[130] The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc and the Trade Union of Congress of the Philippines have condemned anti-Chinese propaganda with links to the virus.[130] Adamson University, a prominent Catholic school in Manila, received online backlash for ordering all its Chinese students to quarantine themselves amid the new coronavirus outbreak.[131] A crematorium refused to handle the corpse of a Chinese national who died from the virus.[132] President Rodrigo Duterte has made appeals to the public to stop discriminating against anyone who merely happens to be of Chinese ancestry.[133] Images of a South Asian migrant worker who was dressed as a human hand sanitiser while wearing a face mask for Saudi Aramco went viral online and sparked global outrage and was cited as another example of \"coronavirus racism\".[134][135] The company later apologised for the incident.[136] An online petition urging the government of Singapore to ban Chinese nationals and travellers from China from entering the island country was signed by 125,000 people.[137] The Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered an investigation against an Islamic teacher, Abdul Halim bin Abdul Karim, after he had posted on Facebook that the coronavirus pandemic was \"a retribution by Allah against the Chinese for their oppressive treatment of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang\". In a separate post, Abdul Halim claimed that Chinese people do not wash properly after defecating and were not as hygienic as Muslims, causing the virus to spread. Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam slammed the comments as \"silly\", \"xenophobic\" and \"thoroughly racist\" and is \"quite unacceptable from anyone, let alone someone who is supposed to be a religious teacher\".[138] The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore said it is aware of the post, which \"expresses views that do not represent the Muslim community\" and was investigating the matter.[139] In response, Abdul Halim said his Facebook post, written in Malay, was not intended to be racist and did not target \"any particular race\".[140] Due to the Indian variant, a 55-year-old Singaporean-Indian female was being attacked for not properly wearing a mask.

Migrant workers from neighboring Myanmar bore the brunt of the blame, including incendiary social media posts advocating violence, such as \"wherever you see Myanmar people, shoot them down,\" and refusal of service across Thai society, with Burmese citizens refused access to buses, motorcycle taxis, and offices. COVID-19 xenophobia also led to a reawakening of anger related to the 18th century destruction by Burmese forces of Ayutthaya, capital of what was then known as Siam, now Thailand. The head of Thailand's COVID-19 task force pleaded for tolerance in a televised broadcast, appealing to common religious values: \"Today they are our family ... Both Myanmar and Thai people are Buddhists.\"[155] In January 2021, however, 19 migrants from Myanmar, all Rohingya Muslims, were arrested at a crowded house near Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok. Authorities claimed that seven of the allegedly unauthorized migrants had tested positive for the coronavirus.[156] While in 2019, a poll estimated that 83.2% of Turks wanted all Syrian refugees returned, the pandemic caused a further rise of xenophobia and anti-refugee sentiment in Turkey.[157] A couple of religious news outlets have reported a spike in attacks on Turkish churches, with some scapegoating Christians for the coronavirus crisis in Turkey.[158][159] Some Israeli researchers and Jewish Turks reported in 2020 that antisemitic conspiracy theories blaming Jews for COVID-19 were spreading on Turkish social media.[160][161] Following comments made by Kuwaiti actress Hayat Al-Fahad about the deportation of migrant workers to the desert or to their countries of origin due to COVID-19,[106] Emirati poet Tariq Al-Mehyas clarified Al-Fahad's comments by stating \"When we say \"migrants\" we mean Asians [not Arabs]\".[162] He went on to say that Arab workers from countries such as Egypt and Sudan were better than Asian (Indian and Bengali) workers and said Asians in the Gulf are never treated equally with Arabs.[162] When his comments generated widespread outrage in the UAE, he said he was not racist because he had an Asian maid.[163][164] Al-Mehyas was later arrested by Emirati authorities for inciting hatred.[163] Asia Times reported that \"A number of Vietnamese hotels and guesthouses have reportedly hung signs on their doors saying Chinese guests are not welcome, while many Vietnamese have gone online to demand the closure of all border crossings with China.\"[165] Signs suggesting that Chinese customers are not accepted were seen in front of a shop in Phu Quoc and a restaurant in Da Nang.[166] Anger was also reported due to the increasing number of the infected cases coming from the Muslim community returning from Malaysia following their attendance of the Tablighi Jamaat festival in Sri Petaling mosque, and two to three patients did not obey the self-quarantine law in Vietnam and still attended Islamic events in Ho Chi Minh City, leading to fury and demands to imprison the Muslim population, even among Vietnamese celebrities.[167] There have been reports by Asian people of increased racism in Belgium due to the pandemic.[168] A Belgian woman of Chinese origin was called \"coronavirus\", threatened, and spat on by five youths in Schaerbeek.[169] A photograph depicting high school students in Chinese costumes while holding a sign that said \"Corona Time\" was posted on the official Facebook and Instagram of Sint-Paulusschool Campus College Waregem, a secondary school, in March 2020.[170][171][172] One of the students added latex gloves and a medical mask to his attire in reference to the outbreak,[170][172] while another student stretched her eyes in a racist gesture.[170][171] The photograph was removed after online backlash.[170][171] The school released a statement, claiming that the school team and the last-grade students had no intention to be condescending or offensive.[171] In Brussels, a 22-year-old man punched a 24-year-old Asian man and accused him of being \"the cause\" of coronavirus in Belgium.[173] On 15 February 2020, during a Croatian Table Tennis Superleague match which was played in Dubrovnik between the local team Libertas Marinkolora and guest team STK Starr from Vara≈ædin, a number of insulting comments were posted on the official Libertas Marinkolora Facebook page towards a Croatian player of Chinese origin, Tan Ruiwu of STK Starr which referenced the coronavirus. This included a comment by the manager of Libertas Marinkolor Marko Habijanec in which he instructed one of his players (who was facing Tan in the next match) to \"Beat this virus\". The comments were subsequently deleted.[174] Libertas Marinkolor eventually issued an apology and condemnation of the incident.[175] In January 2020, Jyllands-Posten received international attention when it published a cartoon depicting the Chinese flag with yellow virus-like figures instead of the usual yellow stars.

Media organizations in these nations have also sometimes taken discriminatory stances, with one Romanian media outlet claiming that Romani people were disease reservoirs, having genetic resistance to COVID-19 themselves, yet able to pass it on to others.[287] Meanwhile, in Hungary, Romani leaders have claimed that they have been left out of the nation's aggressive COVID-19 immunization drive and thus were forced to organize their own community initiatives to spur lagging vaccination rates.[288] A national report, funded by the Government of Canada and conducted as a collaboration with the Chinese Canadian National Council \u2013 Toronto Chapter, Project 107, Vancouver Asian Film Festival and the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, revealed there were 600 documented anti-Asian incidents reported in the country since the start of the pandemic.[289] It revealed that East Asians suffered the most attacks at 83%, followed by Southeast Asians at 7%, South Asians at 2%, mixed-race or biracial Canadians at 1.5% and Indigenous Canadians at 1%.[289] On 26 January 2020, Peter Akman, a reporter who was with CTV News, tweeted an image of his Asian barber in a mask and said, \"Hopefully all I got today was a haircut.\"[290] He was fired after the tweet was reported.[291] On 29 January 2020, Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada and head of the Public Health Agency of Canada, expressed her concern.

While many colonies cooperated with provincial health officials to control these outbreaks, some displayed resistance \u2013 which led to the group as a whole becoming stigmatized by the general population and facing discrimination.[321] After facing the threat of a human rights complaint by a community member,[322] Manitoba announced that it would no longer link COVID-19 cases to Hutterite colonies unless there is risk to the general public.[321] For similar reasons, the Hutterian Safety Council (HSC) criticized Saskatchewan for linking outbreaks to Hutterite colonies where there is no risk to the public \u2013 even after it began to use the euphemism \"communal living setting\" to identify them \u2013 considering it a form of \"cultural profiling\" as no other group had been singled out in this manner. The province's medical officer Saqib Shahab said it was \"very important to recognize there will be different settings for transmission\", and that the public needed to be aware of where new cases were located.[323][324] According to a June 2020 Pew Research study 58% of Asian Americans and 45% of African Americans believe that racist views toward them had increased since the pandemic.[325] A study by the New York University College of Arts & Science found that there was no overall increase of Anti-Asian sentiment among the American population, instead it suggested that \"already prejudiced persons\" had felt authorized by the pandemic to act openly on their prejudices.[326] Early calls for blaming China for the pandemic outbreak included derogatory use of the phrases \"Chinese flu\", \"China flu\", or \"Wuhan flu\", phrases embraced and widely used by then-President Donald Trump and his supporters.[327] There were several thousand incidences of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans between 28 January and 24 February 2020, according to a tally compiled by Russell Jeung, professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.[328] An online reporting forum called \"Stop AAPI Hate\" recorded \"650 direct reports of discrimination against primarily Asian Americans\" between 18 and 26 March 2020,[328] this later increased to 1,497 reports by 15 April 2020, and most targets were of Chinese (40%) and Korean (16%) descents.[329] According to a WHYY-FM report (21 April 2020), incidents of anti-Asian racism, including discrimination, racial slurs and violent attacks, especially towards Chinese Americans, were caused both by white Americans and African Americans;[330] most cases remain unreported to the authorities.[330] By 28 February 2021, it had risen to 3,795.[331] Media critique organisation FAIR has documented instances of anti-Asian racism on the street, and reports that many media outlets such as CNN, The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News capitalise on Sinophobia and \"Orientalist tropes that the Chinese are inherently sneaky and untrustworthy, and are ruled by an incompetent, authoritarian government that is the 'sick man of Asia'\".[332] An article on The Conversation has also noted anti-Chinese sentiments from similar media outlets on their coverage of Chinese wet markets.[333] The University of California, Berkeley's University Health Services posted an infographic on common reactions to the novel coronavirus epidemic that said \"Xenophobia: fears about interacting with those who might be from Asia and guilt about these feelings\" is normal.

Both men ended up injured and the police later had to intervene.[525] Local authorities quarantined three Japanese nationals despite them having no coronavirus-related symptoms.[16] Brazil's Education Minister, Abraham Weintraub, tweeted an anti-Chinese slur on 4 April 2020.

However, Le√£o expressed concern that anti-Asian sentiment will increase in Brazil as well, because of how Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro tried to use the pandemic as an opportunity to attack China, similar to Donald Trump. In early 2020, Bolsonaro reportedly became convinced that COVID-19 was \"part of a Chinese government scheme to expand its global power\". According to Le√£o, there have already been reports of Brazilians of Asian descent suffering from pandemic-related harassment, for example, being told to \"go back to their country\" or being accused of \"spreading the virus\".

Go back to your country, you animal\" when he tried to take off his mask to drink water at a clinic in Rio de Janeiro at the end of 2020.[529] Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned racism against Chinese Canadians while attending a Lunar New Year festival in Toronto on 29 January 2020.[530] Likewise, John Tory, the Mayor of Toronto, denounced xenophobia toward Chinese Canadians, amid reports of increasing stigma facing that community.[531][532] On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization's Emergency Committee issued a statement advising all countries to be mindful of the \"principles of Article 3 of the IHR (the International Health Regulations)\", which the WHO says is a caution against \"actions that promote stigma or discrimination\", when conducting national response measures to the outbreak.[533] In response to the heightened outbreak of the virus in Italy, which caused the Chinese community to shut down businesses due to racist attacks, President Sergio Mattarella made a surprise visit on 6 February 2020 to a primary school in Rome where nearly half the pupils are Chinese, saying \"Friendship and peace are fundamental and you know it.\"[534][535] An online petition entitled We zijn geen virussen! (\"We are not viruses!\" in English) was started in the Netherlands on 8 February 2020 in protest of racism against Dutch Chinese and others of Asian descent, which garnered over 13,600 signatures on its first day and had been signed more than 57,600 times by the end of the month.[536] On 27 February 2020, the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for solidarity with people of ethnic Asian origin subject to such discrimination.[537] On 14 March 2020, more than two hundred civil rights groups in the United States demanded that the House of Representatives and Senate leadership publicly denounce the growing amount of anti-Asian racism related to the pandemic and take \"tangible steps to counter the hysteria\" around the coronavirus, offering the passage of a joint resolution denouncing the racism and xenophobia as one solution.[538] Stop AAPI Hate, a joint project of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department, launched a website on 20 March 2020, encouraging the reporting of coronavirus-related harassment, discrimination, and bigotry.[539][391][540] In the United States, The Anti-Defamation League, the FBI and former 2020 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang have also pointed out that the virus has led to increased incidents of antisemitism.[541][542] New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a hotline for New Yorkers to report hate crimes and discrimination amid the coronavirus outbreak.[543] In response to the scandal surrounding anti-African discrimination, provincial authorities in the Chinese province of Guangdong set up a hotline for foreign nationals and laid out measures discouraging businesses and rental houses in Guangzhou from refusing people based on race or nationality.[544][545] In response to the rising discrimination against Asian Americans, the Black Lives Matter movement condemned the racism against Asian-Americans via Twitter.[546] In 2020, Red Hong Yi (also referred to as 'Red'), a Malaysian artist, created and released a series of 10 artworks via her Instagram page titled \"#IAMNOTAVIRUS\" that depicted portraits of numerous Asian personalities out of foodstuff such as matcha leaves that she found in her house during lockdown.[547] Acting as a response to anti-Asian hate crimes that heightened during the Coronavirus pandemic, she described the importance of \"standing up for everyone no matter their skin colour.\"[548] In June 2021, the City Council of Aurora, Colorado agreed to utilize city funds to supply Asian residents with safety kits and provide AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) training for Aurora police officers. This comes amidst a recent city council decision to reject a Statue of Peace proposal in Aurora. In response to the statue proposal being defeated, city staff wrote in a letter that \u201cThe memorials have attracted a wide-range of community response including peaceful and antagonistic free speech events, vandalism, Asian hate, and legal action requesting removal,\u201d and that \u201dbased on this information the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Department believes the memorial placement on city-owned property is not a compatible use.\u201d[549] On September 8, 2021, research published by Mandiant and Google found that a network of thousands of fake social media accounts across dozens of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, were linked to the Chinese government and were attempting to draw protests in the United States against anti-Asian-American sentiment and against allegations that China engineered SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.[550]","Title":"Xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10947","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic"}
