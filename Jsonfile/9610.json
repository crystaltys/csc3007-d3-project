{"Content: ":"Samuel Jay Crumbine (September 17, 1862 \u2013 July 12, 1954) was a pioneer in public health who campaigned against the common drinking cup, the common towel, and spitting in public in order to prevent the spread of tuberculosis and other germs.[1] Crumbine was born at Emlenton, Pennsylvania on September 17, 1862, the son of Samuel D. Crumbine and Sarah (Mull) Crumbine, both natives of Pennsylvania. His mother was of German and English descent; his father, who was of German descent and a mechanic, served in the Union Army during the American Civil War as a member of the One Hundred and Third Pennsylvania infantry, being first sergeant of Company H. He was captured by the Confederates and confined in Libby prison, where he died of sickness, his death occurring prior to the birth of his son, Samuel. The mother of Crumbine died in Pennsylvania, in 1902, aged sixty-two years. At the age of twenty-one, Crumbine entered the Cincinnati College of Medicine and Surgery, where he worked his way through and graduated in 1888. Upon receiving his diploma, he moved to Kansas and engaged in the practice of his profession at Dodge City. While there, he was appointed to the State Board of Health by Gov. W. E. Stanley. Then on September 1, 1911, he assumed the duties of Dean of the School of Medicine of the University of Kansas. Dr. Crumbine was married September 17, 1890, his twenty-eighth birthday, to Miss Catharine Zuercher, of Cincinnati, Ohio. They had two children: Warren, born January 29, 1892, and Violet, born March 5, 1896. Dr. Crumbine began his medical practice \u201cin rip-roaring, untamed Dodge City during its heyday,\u201d the late 1880s and early 1890s. Fresh from medical school in 1885, he was taken on a tour of the saloons in the unsavory South Side. \u201cI heard peals of laughter,\u201d he related in later days, \u201cstaccato calls of the floor manager, occasional whoops of cowboys, and constant shuffling of heavy boots. At one end of the hall was a bar, doing a rushing business. At the other, on a small platform, was an orchestra\u2014fiddle, guitar and banjo. The women were house entertainers, servants or demimondes.\u201d Dr. Crumbine was the model for \"Doc Adams\" on the long running TV show \"Gunsmoke\". The legendary lawmen of Dodge City\u2014Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Luke Short and Bill Tilghman\u2014were his contemporaries. On one occasion, he saw Tilghman through a severe siege of pneumonia. The lawman became one of the few to live to a ripe old age. He moved to Topeka to become secretary of the Kansas Board of Health and eventually became nationally known for his work with the U.S. Public Health Service. He is the inventor of the flyswatter, an improvement on the earlier \"flybat\" produced by Frank H. Rose.[citation needed] In 1905, he titled one of his fly bulletins, which warned of flyborne diseases, \u201cSwat the Fly,\u201d after a chant he heard at a ballgame. Crumbine took an invention known as the Fly Bat \u2014 a screen attached to a yardstick \u2014 and renamed it the Fly Swatter, which became the generic term we use today. He died in New York City in 1954. Dr. Crumbine had two children: Violet (March 5, 1896 \u2013 May 13, 1973) and Warren (January 29, 1892 \u2013 February 16, 1916), both of whom were born in Dodge City, Kansas. Violet had one child, Carolyn (July 17, 1930 \u2013 April 4, 2011), who never married and died New York City. Warren (January 28, 1892 \u2013 February 16, 1916) married Beulah Searle (October 30, 1891 \u2013 February 7, 1919) in Geneva, Ohio in 1915. Warren, who died of pneumonia in Shanghai at the age of 24, had one child born after his death also named Warren (August 23, 1916 \u2013 January 5, 1993). The younger Warren, an orphan from age 2, married Marian Thomas (March 25, 1916 \u2013 April 13, 1994) in 1937 and died in New Hampshire at the age of 76. They had four children: Peter (August 3, 1938- ), Dennis (July 8, 1940- ), Nancy (October 18, 1946- ), and Katie (October 23, 1951- ) As of June 2020, Dr. Crumbine had 21 direct and living descendants.[2] Peter was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio and educated at Dartmouth College (Phi Beta Kappa) and Stanford University (MBA and MS in Electrical Engineering).
