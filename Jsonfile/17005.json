{"Content: ":"Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. Also starring are Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton. Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until another Cameron film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.195 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". In 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS Titanic. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they only find a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the Titanic struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh. She recounts her experiences aboard Titanic. In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley, and Rose's widowed mother, Ruth, board the Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to jump overboard. Jack appears and coaxes her back onto the deck. The two develop a tentative friendship, but when Cal and Ruth strongly object, Rose acquiesces and discourages Jack's attention. She soon realizes she has feelings for Jack. Rose brings Jack to her state room and pays him a coin to sketch her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing the serious situation. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and Rose's insulting note left inside his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is then confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal then puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket. With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they barely make it back to the boat deck. Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Having arranged to save himself, Cal falsely claims he can get Jack safely off the ship. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back on board. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. They get away, and Cal realizes that he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose; he later boards a lifeboat posing as a lost child's father. Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and the ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks. As passengers fall to their deaths, Jack and Rose desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section dives downward. The remaining stern slams back onto the ocean, then upends again before it, too, sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person and makes her promise to survive. Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat, keeping her promise, and Jack dies of hypothermia. The RMS Carpathia rescues the survivors; Rose avoids Cal by hiding among the steerage passengers and gives her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket. In the present, Rose says she later heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[8] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by her early conversations with Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at Titanic's Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died on the ship. Although not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[20] the film includes portrayals of several historical figures: Several crew members of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh appear in the film, including Anatoly Sagalevich, creator and pilot of the MIR self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[40] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the Titanic Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[41][42] \"The story could not have been written better...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable...the unthinkable possible.\" \u2014James Cameron[43] James Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him the RMS Titanic was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[44][45][46] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. So when an IMAX film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself, he decided to seek Hollywood funding to \"pay for an expedition and do the same thing\". It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[44] Cameron wrote a scriptment for a Titanic film,[47] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic\".[45][46] Cameron stated, \"They were like, 'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u2013 a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets, shoot-outs, or car chases?' I said, 'No, no, no. It's not like that.'\"[10] The studio was dubious about the idea's commercial prospects, but, hoping for a long-term relationship with Cameron, they gave him a greenlight.[10][11][19] Cameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck itself,[47] and organized several dives to the site over a period of two years.[43] \"My pitch on that had to be a little more detailed,\" said Cameron. \"So I said, 'Look, we've got to do this whole opening where they're exploring the Titanic and they find the diamond, so we're going to have all these shots of the ship.\" Cameron stated, \"Now, we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money \u2013 or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[45] The crew shot at the real wreck in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995. At that depth, with a water pressure of 6,000 pounds per square inch, \"one small flaw in the vessel's superstructure would mean instant death for all on board.\" Not only were the dives high-risk, but adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high-quality footage that he wanted.[11] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with Titanic's hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of Captain Smith's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior. The area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was also damaged.[48] Descending to the actual site made both Cameron and crew want \"to live up to that level of reality ... But there was another level of reaction coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama,\" he said. \"It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" Cameron stated, \"You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one \u2013 maybe a documentarian.\" Due to this, he felt \"a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it \u2013 to do that part of it right, too\".[19] After filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[47] He wanted to honor the people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanic's crew and passengers.[43] \"I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life,\" he said.[45] \"And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it.\"[45] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californian's role in Titanic's demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship that night. \"I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially if we were going to dive to the ship,\" he said. \"That set the bar higher in a way \u2013 it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[45] Cameron was influenced in his crafting of the film by the 1958 British production A Night to Remember, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes from that film, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[49] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking of the ship.[20] Cameron felt the Titanic sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[43] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy,[40] while the blossoming romance of Jack and Rose, Cameron believed, would be the most engaging part of the story: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[43] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in Titanic I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[19] Cameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[43] While Winslet and Stuart stated their belief that, instead of being asleep in her bed, the character dies at the end of the film,[50][51] Cameron said that he would rather not reveal what he intended with the ending because \"[t]he answer has to be something you supply personally; individually.\"[8] [53]Harland and Wolff, the RMS Titanic's builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[52] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60 foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by naval architect Jay Kantola utilizing plans of the Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.[53] Towering above was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[40] The sets representing the interior rooms of the Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic's builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs.[54] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[55] Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.[11] Principal photography for Titanic began in July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the filming of the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh.[40] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale RMS Titanic had been constructed.[40] The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[56] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[57] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[56] Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[58] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[11] Despite this, several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film, not least involving the two main stars.[59][60] Cameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[61] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[19] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.[19] Other times on the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[62] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship was to be sunk. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[62] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[62] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds,\" he said.[62] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[62] In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[62] During the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh shoot in Canada, an angry crew member put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[10][63] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[63] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[10] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[10][62] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[50][64] The filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[64] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[64] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[65] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged: I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[64] The costs of filming Titanic eventually began to mount and finally reached $200 million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[66] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[10] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[10] Cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than T2 and True Lies. Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[19] Cameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Many previous films about the RMS Titanic shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[67] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[68] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[67] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS Jeremiah O'Brien's engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[69] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[70] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[71] An enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of the RMS Titanic had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[40] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[72] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[52] The climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous Titanic films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[11] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[11] A Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[73] There was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film \u2013 the SS Californian was close to the Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"[19] During the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the Titanic's sinking.[74] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ...you didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need\".[75] The version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it.[76] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the \"Heart of the Ocean\" if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[76] Cameron wrote Titanic while listening to the work of Irish new-age musician Enya.[77] He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined.[78] Cameron instead chose James Horner to compose the film's score. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on Aliens,[79] but Titanic cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[80] For the vocals heard throughout the film, subsequently described by Earle Hitchner of The Wall Street Journal as \"evocative\", Horner chose Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen, and he particularly liked how she sang \"Eg veit i himmerik ei borg\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He had tried twenty-five or thirty singers before he finally chose Sissel as the voice to create specific moods within the film.[81] Horner additionally wrote the song \"My Heart Will Go On\" in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs with singing in the film.[82] Céline Dion agreed to record a demo with the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[82] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[11] For the Heart of the Ocean design, London-based jewelers Asprey & Garrard used cubic zirconias set in white gold[83] to create an Edwardian-style necklace to be used as a prop in the film. Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences. The third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[83] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[84] for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Celine Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing. 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures co-financed Titanic, with Paramount handling the North American distribution and Fox handling the international release. They expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997. The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[11] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film for summer would not be possible.[11] With production delays, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[85] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[11] The film premiered on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[86] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by The New York Times.[87] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[11] Including revenue from the 2012 and 2017 reissues, Titanic earned $659.4 million in North America and $1.812 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.195 billion.[7] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, and remained so for twelve years, until Avatar (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[88] On March 1, 1998,[89] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide[90] and on the weekend April 13\u201315, 2012\u2014a century after the original vessel's foundering, Titanic became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[91] Box Office Mojo estimates that Titanic is the fifth highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[92] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[93] Titanic was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[94] A 2017 Hindustan Times report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[95] The film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of the eighteenth James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies. By New Year's Day, Titanic had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. Its highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[96][97] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[98] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[99] equivalent to $1014.2 million in 2021[100]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[101] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[102] Before Titanic's release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[62][103][104][105] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\" since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs \u2013 because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[104] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[62] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[62] \"It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: 'I'm the king of the world!' As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in Titanic, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant 'eff off', in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\" \u2014Christopher Goodwin of The Times on Cameron's response to Titanic's criticism[62] When the film became a success, with an unprecedented box office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[103] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[104] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[106] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[104] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen Titanic twice by its fifth week.[107] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[108] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[106][109] The Hollywood Reporter estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[110] Titanic's impact on men has also been especially credited.[111][112][113] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[111][112] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[111] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film Zombieland, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since Titanic.\"[114] In 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during Titanic and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[112] Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[113] Quotes in the film aided its popularity. Titanic's catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[115][116] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[116] Cameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how Titanic worked.\"[117] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for Titanic was over 20%.\"[11] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[11] Titanic held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[118] Cameron's follow-up film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[119][120] and did so in 2010.[88] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of Titanic's haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [tracked] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[121] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic's revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[119] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord.\"[106] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar's performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[120] Author Alexandra Keller, when analyzing Titanic's success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s \u2013 awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[122] Titanic garnered mainly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[122][123][124] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 232 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[109] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average rating of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[125] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[126] With regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[127] He named it his ninth best film of 1997.[128] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[129] James Berardinelli stated, \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it.\"[130] It was named his second best film of 1997.[131] Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, \"To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[132] The romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said, \"You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[133] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[132] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that \"Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind.\"[132] Adrian Turner of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. Titanic is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[134] Titanic suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[124] Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[135] Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close\",[136] and later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[137] Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[138] According to Dalin Rowell of /Film, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, Titanic is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[139] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[140] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[141] but it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time\".[142] In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered\".[143] The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[144] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[145] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[105] In 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"Titanic is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless \u2013 and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[146] In 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's Titanic was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[147] Empire eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's Titanic at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[148] In 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[149] It was listed among the 100 best films in an Empire poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[150][151] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of /Film ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement \u2014 one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, Titanic demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[139] Titanic began its awards sweep starting with the Golden Globes, winning four: Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[152] Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were also nominees.[153] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve[154] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the Titanic to win that award, after 1933's Cavalcade), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[155] Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart and the make-up artists were the three nominees that did not win. James Cameron's original screenplay and Leonardo DiCaprio were not nominees.[103] It was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King would also match this record in 2004.[156] Titanic won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[157][158] The film's soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, and became a worldwide success, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[159] The soundtrack also became the best-selling album of 1998 in the U.S.[160] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. The film also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[161] Titanic eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[citation needed] Additionally, the book about the making of the film was at the top of The New York Times' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[11] Since its release, Titanic has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years... series. So far, it has ranked on the following six lists: Titanic was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[167] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[168] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million becoming the best selling live-action video, beating Independence Day.[169] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling The Lion King for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[169] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units.[170] A DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[171] At the time, fewer than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original Titanic DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[171] Titanic was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc Special Collector's Edition was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, as well as various special features. The two-disc edition was marketed as the Special Edition, and featured the first two discs of the three-disc set, only PAL-enabled. A four-disc edition, only available in the United Kingdom and marketed as the Deluxe Collector's Edition, was also released on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title Deluxe Limited Edition, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary Ghosts of the Abyss, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of Ghosts of the Abyss, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[105] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a 10th Anniversary Edition was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[172] A limited-edition 4-Disc Blu-ray 3D version of the film was released on September 10, 2012.[173] A 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[174] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[175] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[176] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the scene for showing an unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send film director Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[177] The 3D version of Titanic premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[178][179] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days shy of the centenary of RMS Titanic embarking on her maiden voyage.[180][181][182] Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1\u20442 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies Titanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[183] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[184] Richard Corliss of Time, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[185] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She further added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[186] The film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place.[187][188] Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[189] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[190] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[191] going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[190] The reissue ultimately earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[192] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of Titanic remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of The Lion King, Star Wars, and Avatar.[193] The 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[194][195][196] For the 20th anniversary of the film, Titanic was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[197] Titanic will return to theaters on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary.[198] Titanic Live was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[199] In April 2015, Titanic Live premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[200] A board game based on the film, titled Titanic: The Game, was released in 2020 by Spin Master Games.[201] ","Title":"Titanic (1997 film) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17005","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)"}
