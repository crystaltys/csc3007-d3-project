{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Montreal is part of an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until April 2021, Montreal was the worst affected health region in Canada.[4][5] Despite being surpassed by Toronto in total number of cases, Montreal still has the highest total death count and the highest death rate in Canada, with the death rate from COVID-19 being two times higher on the island of Montreal than in the city of Toronto due in large part to substantial outbreaks in long-term care homes.[4] Montreal is Canada's second most populous city, the largest city in Quebec, and the eighth most populous city in North America. Montreal confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on February 27, 2020. The patient was a 41-year-old woman who had returned from Iran three days earlier on a flight from Doha, Qatar.[6][7] In early March 2020, the closure of public spaces, including stores, gyms, shopping malls, and schools, began. On March 27, with nearly 1,000 confirmed cases,[4] Montreal declared a state of emergency.[8] The first wave of COVID-19 lasted until early summer, at which point the economy started to gradually reopen, with daily case counts dropping into the double digits.[9] In September 2020, facing the possibility of a second wave, the Quebec government announced a colour-coded alert level system made up of four zones (green, yellow, orange, and red), with restrictions being least severe in green zones and most severe in red zones. On September 30, Montreal was placed in the red zone.[10] Over the next few months, the second wave continued to worsen, prompting renewed closures and eventually, a province-wide lockdown, which came into effect on December 25 (Christmas Day). On January 9, a curfew came into effect.[2] The lockdown ended a month later, allowing for non-essential businesses to reopen.[11] In December 2020, the vaccination campaign began, starting with residents of long-term care homes and healthcare workers.[12] On March 1, 2021, only a year after the arrival of the pandemic, mass vaccination of the general population began.[13] At the end of March 2021, as the second wave was dying down, some restrictions were lifted, including the closure of gyms, theatres, and show venues. Not even two weeks later, the reopening was reversed due to a third wave driven by the Alpha variant.[14][15] However, unlike the first and second waves, Montreal and its surrounding areas were not the hotspot of the province during the third wave, managing to endure it with only a minimal to non-existent rise in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Towards the end of May, with over 50% of the island's population vaccinated with at least one dose, restrictions started to gradually lift, with the curfew ending on May 28 in all regions of Quebec.[16] On June 7, after about eight months in the red zone, Montreal moved into the orange zone, allowing gyms and dine-in restaurants to open,[17] and on June 14, they moved into the yellow zone, allowing bars to reopen.[18][19] Finally, on June 28, Montreal moved into the zone with the fewest restrictions, the green zone.[20][21] Two months later, Montreal ended its state of emergency.[22] With the rise of the Omicron variant, the Quebec government reintroduced province-wide restrictions in December 2021, forcing gyms, restaurants, and other establishments to close, despite the vaccine passport requirement in these settings and a high vaccination rate in Montreal.[23] During the first two weeks of 2022, Montreal was subject to a contentious curfew[24] from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.[25] Restrictions began to loosen in February 2022, and by mid-March, almost all COVID-19 measures in Montreal had been lifted, with the notable exception of the mask mandate.[26] Finally, on May 14, 2022, the mask mandate for most indoor spaces was lifted.[27]  During the period between the start of the health emergency in Quebec, on March 13, 2020, and May 15, 2020, crimes in Montreal fell by 30% compared to the same period in 2019.[28] In April, a drastic drop of more than two-thirds of reports to the DPJ was observed by the interveners compared to last year.[29] With the suspension of most professional sports leagues, the illegal sports betting network of the Montreal mafia was also undermined.[30] The price of a kilogram of cocaine in Montreal was around $65,000 per kilogram, compared to $43,000 before the pandemic.[31] On July 18, the date on which wearing a mask in indoor public places became compulsory in Quebec, a man was arrested in a Tim Hortons in Montreal as a result of his refusal to wear a mask. The event was filmed and went viral.[32] In Old Montreal, residents have reported an increase in crime in the absence of tourists. In response, the Old Port of Montreal set a midnight curfew in the area on June 2, 2021.[33] On March 12, Montreal cancelled the St. Patrick's Day parades for the first time in its 196-year history.[34][35] The Montreal Symphony Orchestra cancelled concerts scheduled through May 24, including a planned performance at New York City's Carnegie Hall.[36] Various festivals were cancelled, including Les Francos,[37] Montréal Complètement Cirque,[38] and the Montreal International Jazz Festival.[37] Montreal's Just for Laughs comedy festival was postponed to late September and early October.[39] The Montreal Fireworks Festival was also cancelled.[40] On March 13, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA), the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC), and the OPTICA contemporary art centre in Montreal were closed indefinitely, in addition to all national museums in Canada.[41] The next day, the McCord Museum did the same.[42] On April 17, the McCord Museum launched a collaborative photographic project that would use photos to document this period of confinement.[43] On May 5, Montreal museums raised the possibility of reopening by early summer.[44] On March 14, the Beaubien cinema, the Parc cinema, the Musée cinema, and the Quebec Cinematics, as well as all the museums and all the libraries in the Bibliothèque et Archives Nationales du Québec network closed their doors for 30 days following the request of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Mrs. Nathalie Roy. In addition to these cinemas, the performance halls of the Théâtre de Quat'Sous and the Théâte PAP, the Agora de la danse and the Prospero theater.[45] As of April 9, several events and shows were cancelled due to COVID-19, including: On April 10, following the government's request to suspend events across Quebec until August 31, evenko confirmed that its festivals, notably OSHEAGA, ILESONIQ, and LASSO Montreal will not take place on the scheduled dates, without however officially cancelling said festivals.[53] The Montreal Pride Festival, scheduled from August 6 to 16, was also cancelled.[54] On May 19, the Montreal Pride announced that a virtual parade would take place from August 10 to 16, 2020.[55] The next day, the Backstreet Boys officially postponed their DNA tour, which was scheduled to stop at the Bell Centre in Montreal on September 16.[56] On May 22, Minister of Culture Nathalie Roy announced the reopening of museum institutions, cultural product loan counters, and drive-ins on Friday, May 29 throughout Quebec.[57] On May 29, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts announced the resumption of its activities as of June 6, 2020.[58] On June 4, the OSM played for the first time in two months at the Maison Symphonique de Montréal.[59] On June 9, the Osheaga and ILE SONIQ music festivals, which took place every summer in Montreal, were postponed to 2021.[60] On June 17, the organizers of the Montreal International Jazz Festival announced that a virtual festival would take place from June 27 to 30.[61] On June 22, the Opéra de Montréal postponed its Jenufa and La Traviata productions, scheduled for fall 2020, due to COVID-19.[62] On June 23, the McCord Museum reopened.

The city of Montreal provided a budget of $800,000 for this purpose.[65] While the national unemployment rate in April 2020 was 13%, it was estimated to be at 18.2% in the Montreal metropolitan region, up 13.4 percentage points since February.[66] Towards the end of April, Montreal announced a plan to cut its expenditures to fill the deficit of $500 million.[67] The Conference Board suggested that economic activity in the Montreal region would decline by 3.6% in 2020, the result of a fall of 6.6% expected in the second quarter. It was estimated that the Montreal market should lose almost 55,000 jobs in 2020, with an unemployment rate of up to 8.9% (compared to 5.7% last year).[68] On May 7, Montreal deployed the Fonds de développement de l'économie sociale (FDES) program, which offers grants of up to $50,000 for \"startup, growth or consolidation projects.\"[69] On May 19, for the first time in almost two and a half months, Montreal gas stations sold a liter of regular fuel at a price greater than $1 per liter.[70] After a record year in 2019 with a tonnage of goods handled on its quays which exceeded 40 million tonnes, the CEO of the Montreal Port Authority announced on May 19 that she foresaw a 12% drop in traffic in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the pandemic.[71] On May 21, the city postponed for one month the presentation of its economic recovery plan linked to the COVID-19 crisis.[72] On June 2, Valérie Plante said that the city's economic recovery plan would be unveiled in \"the next few weeks\".[73] According to a survey by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec, Montreal was the region that was least economically affected by the pandemic in Quebec, with 35.6% of respondents claiming to have experienced a strong financial impact from COVID-19.[74] On June 2, a committee of experts chaired by the economist Luc Godbout (holder of the chair in taxation and public finance at the Université de Sherbrooke), Richard Sheamur (professor and director of the School of Urban Planning McGill University), and Raquel Fonseca (holder of the Research Chair on Intergenerational Economic Issues at UQAM) presented their report.[75] On June 3, Mayor Valérie Plante postponed the second payment of property taxes[76] On June 4, the Minister of Finance announced that the late deconfinement of Montreal would cause Quebec's GDP to drop by almost 6%[77] On June 5, with the rate reduction mainly affecting Bombardier's mid-range model, the Challenger, assembled in Montreal, the Montreal-based multinational announced the elimination of 2,500 jobs by the end of the year, including 1,500 in Quebec[78] On June 8, the federal and provincial governments provided $50 million in financial assistance to improve emergency assistance to small and medium-sized businesses in Montreal.[79] While the Suncor company was suffering a loss of more than $3.5 billion due to the coronavirus pandemic,[80] the company planned to lower its utilization rates in 2020 by almost 10%. In the East Montreal refinery, 137,000 barrels of gasoline and diesel are produced every day.[81] On June 17, the City of Montreal unveiled its $22 million plan for the economic revival of the metropolis over 6 months.[82] As of June 18: In his June 19 analysis, Gérard Fillion wrote that \"Montreal is in trouble. The city's deficit could be close to $500 million this year, or 9% of the planned budget of $6.2 billion\" and that \"shops, hotels, restaurants, culture, leisure, these are almost 20% of all the jobs in town.\"[84] On June 22, the Montreal company Frank And Oak went into court protection due to the pandemic. Sears, Aldo, Stokes, La Senza, SAIL, and Reitmans had to do the same because of the pandemic.[85] The closure of the Casino de Montréal, between March 12 and June 25, would have deprived Loto-Québec of approximately $2.5M per day, or $330M in total.[86] On Friday, March 13, the Premier of Quebec, François Legault, announced the closure of schools, CEGEPs, and universities until March 30.[87] On March 22, Quebec extended the school closing period until May 1.[88] On April 20, the Minister of Education and Higher Education of Quebec announced that the results of the 2020 winter session would not be counted in the calculation of the R score.[94] Many experts on May 6 fear a significant increase in high school dropout,[95] which before the pandemic was 15%.[96] On May 12, in a survey commissioned by the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) and the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), 77% of Canadian students said they were worried about their future, 70% among them feared not having a job this summer and 30% of them considered leaving their post-secondary studies.[97] On May 15, In a letter sent to Premier Legault, the ministries of health and education, and the mayoress of Montreal, the pediatric association noted a significant delay in the cognitive development of students in Greater Montreal is to be expected because of the prolonged course close.[98] According to Immigration and Citizenship Canada data, some 30,700 foreign students study in Quebec in 2019. About a third of McGill University students come from abroad and between 8% to 10% of Université de Montréal students. To make up for this possibility of losing a large number of students, the Université de Montréal has already indicated that all of its faculties will hold the fall 2020 session by online classes.[99] On May 14, it was Concordia University's turn to do the same.[100] Two days earlier, the 12 Cégeps de la Métropole had announced similar measures.[101] On May 15, the director of Ahuntsic College estimated that the only way school could return in the fall would be through distance education.[102] Five days later, UQAM announced that its fall 2020 session would be held remotely and online.[103] On May 26, the Quebec government allowed international students to start their courses this fall even if they are physically abroad.[104] The next day, it asked universities and Cégeps to prepare to welcome 30% of their students in person for the fall of 2020.[105] On June 1, Daniel Jutras succeeded Guy Breton as rector of UdeM. He delivered a message posted online because of the pandemic.[106] On July 29, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) released a guidance document on the COVID-19 pandemic for post-secondary educational institutions.[107] With 10 days before the start of the school year for CEGEPs in Montreal,[108] the Regroupement des cégeps de Montréal, which brings together 12 French-speaking and English-speaking establishments, could not say the exact percentage of students who will have to set foot in class this fall. For example, 3,500 of the 7,500 students at Collège Ahuntsic will have to show up at one point or another during the week.[109] For its part, the Center de services scolaire de Montréal had 500 teaching positions to fill, including 90 regular positions.[110] On August 10, Jean-François Roberge, Minister of Education, announced his revised plan for the start of the 2020 school year. In it, we learn that students in the third cycle of elementary school (fifth and sixth grade), as well as all high school students will be required to wear the mask in school, but not in classrooms. A week later, the Minister presented two new advertising campaign measures to help elementary and secondary school students who need support from the start of the school year.[111] In a letter sent on August 14 to the Minister of Education, the regional director of public health of Montreal and the national director of public health, the Alliance des professeures et professors de Montreal asked Quebec to revise downwards. teacher-student ratios[112] On August 27, back to school day in Quebec, the Pointe-de-l'Ile school service center in Montreal announced that three staff members from François La-Bernarde, Jules-Verne and Henri-Bourassa had tested positive for COVID-19.[113] The decrease in air traffic, the closure of factories, the increase in telework, and consequently a significant reduction in road vehicles on the road network, have had the effect of significantly reducing greenhouse gases (GHG).[114] According to data from the Réseau de la surveillance de la qualité de l'air,[115] in the east of the city, the average air quality index was 26.2. For the same period last year, the average was 32.6. Obviously, the better the air quality, the lower the index.[116] This index measures conventional gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO/NO2, O3 and H2S), particulate pollution, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).[117] In Montreal, nitrogen dioxide dropped more than 30% during the first two months of the pandemic.[118] Air pollution in Montreal in the spring of 2020 was the lowest since 1997.[119] Like metropolises around the world,[120] more wild animals were seen during the pandemic in Montreal.[121] On April 3, 2020, the chief scientist of Québec and QuébecOiseaux announced the creation of the Des oiseaux à la Maison.[122] As of May 3, 166 species had been sighted in Montreal.[123] From May 30, a humpback whale was staying near the Jacques-Cartier Bridge,[124] finding itself more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) from its natural habitat.[125] On May 31, the 3-4 year old calf would have made more than 50 jumps in the old port.[126] Between the end of March[127] and June 22, 2020, Quebec retailers were not obliged to return returnable containers.[128] It was in the 1990s that the selective collective of materials (cardboard, newspapers, paper, glass, plastic and metal) began.[129] According to Statistics Canada, in 2013\u20132014, Canadians avoided sending over 9 million recycled materials to the landfill. Of this number, more than half went to China.[130] In Quebec, the 27 sorting centres, no longer able to sell our \"recyclable\" materials, have asked for state aid to survive. In early 2018, the Plante administration injected $29.9 million into the Montreal sorting centre.[129] In January 2020, two of the three sorting centres in Montreal threatened to close, including one that had received the subsidy of nearly 30 million two years earlier.[131] Garbage and recyclable materials were recognized as an essential service during the pandemic.[132] Although not in the position of the City of Quebec where 80% of the contents of the recycling bins were stored by (and at the costs of the City of Quebec), a large significant quantity of materials normally recycled ended up in the dumps.[133] As for other materials such as household appliances, refrigerators, wood, sofas, tires, construction residues, dangerous household and green residues,[134] the 7 ecocentres of the agglomeration of Montreal remained open according to the usual schedule, although it was strongly recommended not to go.[135] On February 6, 2020, Mayor Valérie Plante announced the end of plastic bags in all merchants in Montreal by the end of 2020.[136] However, during the crisis, several companies, such as Loblaw or IGA decided to no longer accept reusable bags belonging to customers, the latter having to use plastic bags.[137] As a consequence, packaging manufacturers increased their production by 20%,[138] a phenomenon that was observed across Canada.[139] Saturday April 17, a first attendant to the beneficiary fell in coma against COVID-19.[140] Wednesday, April 29, a beneficiary attendant died after working with patients affected by COVID-19 from CHSLD Cartierville.[141] Thursday, May 21, a beneficiary attendant who came to lend a hand in CHSLDs died as a result of COVID-19.[142] On May 13, nearly 20% of the 19,875 COVID-19 positive cases were healthcare workers.[143] On May 21, a fourth beneficiary attendant in Montreal died as a result of COVID-19.[144] On May 27, health workers demonstrated in several cities in Quebec, including Montreal, to demand their right to vacation.[145] In a press conference on June 2, Premier François Legault stated that the majority of the 10,000 beneficiary attendant positions to be filled targeted the Montreal region.[146][147] On June 11, a sixth beneficiary attendant died from COVID-19 at the age of 48.[148] On June 15, a surgeon at the Sacré-Coeur hospital in Montreal was in intensive care because of COVID-19[149] On April 2, 480 cases were detected in Montreal, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 2,642.
