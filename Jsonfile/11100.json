{"Content: ":"National regulatory authorities have granted emergency use authorizations for thirty-four COVID-19 vaccines. Nine vaccines have been approved for emergency or full use by at least one stringent regulatory authority recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO): Pfizer\u2013BioNTech, Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca, Sinopharm BIBP, Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Novavax, and Convidecia. Eight others are under assessment by the WHO: Sputnik V, Sinopharm WIBP, Abdala, Zifivax, Corbevax, COVIran Barekat, Sanofi\u2013GSK, and SCB-2019.[1] Specific versions of six vaccines have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA): Pfizer\u2013BioNTech, Janssen, Novavax, Moderna, Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca, and Valneva.[2] Specific versions of another four vaccines are under evaluation by the EMA: Sputnik V, CoronaVac, Sanofi\u2013GSK, and PHH-1V.[3] Note that in some countries, vaccines may be authorized solely for travel purposes. They may not be approved for the general population. For example, the CoronaVac, Covishield, BBIBP-CorV and Covaxin vaccines are not part of Australia's national vaccination program; however, they are recognized for the purpose of travel to Australia.[4][5][6] The Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, sold under the brand names Vaxzevria[7] and Covishield,[8] is a viral vector vaccine[9] produced by the British University of Oxford, British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.[9][10][11] Finland, Denmark, and Norway suspended the use of the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine due to a small number of reports of a rare blood clot disorder.[12][13][14][15] Slovakia suspended its use after the death of a predisposed recipient.[16] South Africa suspended its use because a small trial found only minimal protection against mild to moderate disease from the locally predominant Beta variant.[17] Japan approved the vaccine for emergency use in May 2021, but did not plan to use them immediately because of rare cases of a blood clotting disorder reported overseas.[18] Later, Japan started to use the vaccine for people aged 40 or over to mitigate the surge of the Delta variant in August.[19] Finland ceased use of the vaccine as the last batch expired on 30 November 2021. Until then it was only offered for those aged 65 or more due to extremely rare coagulation disorders among younger recipients of the vaccine. After this Finland will not procure more of the vaccine.[20][21][22][23] The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most widely accepted internationally,[24] and the most popular in terms of total inoculated worldwide, over 1.3 billion.[25][26][27][28] The AstraZeneca vaccine is administered in more countries than any other vaccine.[29] EMA countries[7][140][141] CARPHA countries[142] Non-country entities The Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, sold under the brand name Comirnaty,[154] is an mRNA vaccine[155] produced by the German company BioNTech and the American company Pfizer.[155][156][157] In Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, Comirnaty is distributed by Fosun Pharma.[158][159][160][161][162][163] EMA countries[154][140][248] CARPHA countries[249][250] Non-country entities The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine[257] is a viral vector vaccine[258] produced by Janssen Pharmaceutica (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.[259][260] It is also known as Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine and as COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.[261] Three countries, Denmark, Finland, and Norway, discontinued the use of the Janssen vaccine in favor of other available vaccines due to a possible link between the vaccine and a rare blood clot disorder.[262][20][263] The use of the Janssen adenovirus vector vaccine began in Finland in October 2021. It is only offered for those aged 65 and over because of a very rare risk of thrombosis in younger age groups.[21][23][22] EMA countries[261][140][304] CARPHA countries[305] Non-country entities The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, also known as Spikevax,[311] is an mRNA vaccine[312] produced by the American company Moderna, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.[313][314] The Moderna vaccine is not offered for men under 30 years of age in Finland as a precaution to reduce a very rare risk of myocarditis.[315][23] EMA countries[311][140][359] CARPHA countries[249][305] Non-country entities The Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine produced by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and its Beijing Institute of Biological Products.[363][364] CARPHA countries[442] Non-country entities The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine[485] produced by the Russian Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.
