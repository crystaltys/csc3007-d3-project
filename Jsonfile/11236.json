The priority order for vaccination and scheduled time period for administering vaccine for each priority group is determined using a Vaccine Calendar in Denmark.[4] The 10 target groups in descending order of priority are as follows: As of June 2021, children younger than 12 years and pregnant women are not offered vaccination in Denmark.[5] Denmark uses Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Denmark was the first country in Europe to stop using Oxford-AstraZeneca as well as Janssen J&J vaccines by citing blood clots as side effects, despite the approval of these vaccines by the European Medicines Agency.[6][7] As of May 2021, it became possible for Danish citizens to opt-in to receive any of these vaccines, although these vaccines were not included in the Danish vaccination program.[8]","Title":"COVID-19 vaccination in Denmark - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11236","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Denmark"}
