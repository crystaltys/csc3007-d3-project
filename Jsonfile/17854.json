{"Content: ":"The Seventh Curse is a 1986 Hong Kong adventure film directed by Lam Ngai Kai[1] based on Ni Kuang's novel series Dr. Yuen Series and stars Chin Siu-ho as Dr. Yuen. The film also stars Chow Yun-fat as Wisely, the protagonist in Ni's Wisely Series who appears as a supporting character in the Dr Yuen Series, while Ni himself serves as the film's narrator and also making a brief appearance as himself. In this movie, Dr. Yuen (Chin Siu-ho) in the jungle of Thailand attempts to rescue a beautiful girl from being sacrificed to the \"Worm Tribe\" she belongs to. As a result, Yuen is damned with seven \"Blood Curses\" which burst through his leg periodically. When the seventh bursts, he will die, but Betsy, the beauty he saved, stops the curse with an antidote that lasts only one year, so on the advice of Wisely (Chow Yun-fat) he heads back to Thailand to find a permanent cure. Action ensues as Yuen and cohorts battle the evil sorcerer of the Worm Tribe, a hideous bloodthirsty baby-like creature, and \"Old Ancestor,\" a skeleton with glowing blue eyes that transforms into a monster that is a cross between Rodan and Alien. This film has at least three different endings for each of its official releases: One reviewer said, \"The Seventh Curse is weird and crude, gross and tasteless, silly and shocking, but God is it fun.\"[2]","Title":"The Seventh Curse - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17854","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Curse"}
