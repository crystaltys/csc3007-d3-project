{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the most significant disruption[1] to the worldwide sporting calendar since World War II. Across the world and to varying degrees, sports events have been cancelled or postponed.[2][3][4] The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were rescheduled to 2021.[1] At the time, spectators had no games to watch and players no games to play.[5] Only a few countries and territories, such as Hong Kong,[1] Turkmenistan,[6] Belarus, and Nicaragua, continued professional sporting matches as planned.[7] The 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were scheduled to take place in Tokyo starting 24 July and 25 August respectively. Although the Japanese government had taken extra precautions to help minimize the outbreak's impact in the country,[8][9] qualifying events were being canceled or postponed almost daily. According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Tokyo 2020 organizing-committee chief executive Toshiro Muto voiced concerns on 5 February, that COVID-19 might \"throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games.\"[10][11] The traditional Olympic flame lighting ceremony in Olympia, Greece, to mark the start of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was held on 12 March without spectators.[12] On 23 March, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain announced that they would withdraw from the Games unless they are postponed to 2021.[13] On 24 March 2020, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee announced that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be \"rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\", marking the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that an Olympiad has been postponed.[14][15][16] The opening ceremonies of the Games were officially rescheduled to 23 July 2021.[17] The cost of postponing the Olympics to 2021 was estimated to be US$5.8 billion, which included the cost of maintaining the unused venues.[18] The organizing committee published various planned safety protocols for athletes, spectators, and members of the press.[19][20] It was recommended that athletes be vaccinated, but they were not required to do so.[21] On 20 March 2021, citing international travel restrictions and the need to ensure the safety of athletes, it was announced that no spectators or guests from outside of Japan would be allowed to attend the Games. This included both ticketed spectators and the supporters of athletes.[22] While there were initially plans to allow venues to operate at half capacity (to a maximum of 10,000 spectators),[23] it was ultimately announced that nearly the entirety of the Games would be held behind closed doors.[24][25][26] Furthermore, the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics that are scheduled to be held in Paris, France on 26 July and 28 August 2024 respectively as onto the normal 4-year Olympic schedule, are also impacted due to shorter duration between the last Olympics. It is also unknown whether the above safety protocols still have to be applied again. Although the 2022 Winter Olympics hosted by Beijing, China kept their original start date of 4 February 2022 and went ahead as scheduled, the pandemic has already impacted qualifying in specific sports such as curling\u2014where the World Curling Federation announced a proposal to have qualification be dependent on performance in the 2021 world championships (whose top teams will automatically qualify) and a final qualification tournament, as opposed to the previous plan of having qualification determined by both the 2020 and 2021 world championships.[27] Qualification for the women's hockey tournament was to be determined by IIHF World Rankings after the 2020 Women's World Championship. As the tournament was cancelled, the existing rankings going into the tournament were used instead.[28] The World Games in Birmingham, Alabama, were scheduled for July 2021, but because of the rescheduling of the 2020 Summer Olympics, the eleventh World Games will be held in July 2022 instead.[29] The 2020 Arctic Winter Games were cancelled.[30] Additionally, the 2022 Arctic Winter Games was postponed to 2023. The 2020 ASEAN Para Games were cancelled and SEA Games 31 in Hanoi were postponed.[31] The 2021 Summer World University Games in Chengdu, China were postponed to 2022.[32] The 2021 Winter Universiade in Lucerne, Switzerland were first moved from 21 to 31 January to 11\u201321 December, then on 29 November, this event were cancelled. The 2021 World Masters Games, originally scheduled to be held in Japan on between May 14\u201330, were indefinitely postponed after 2022, the organisation announced on 28 October.[33][citation needed] On 12 January 2021, it was announced that the 2021 Games would scheduled for 13\u201329 May 2022.[34] It was postponed to 2026.[35] X Games Chongli 2020 was postponed.[36] X Games Minneapolis 2020 was cancelled.[37] U Sports curtailed its men's and women's ice hockey championships on 12 March 2020. On 8 June, U Sports announced that it had cancelled all national championships for the fall semester of the 2020\u201321 academic year, including Canadian football (the first time the Vanier Cup was not contested since its inception), cross-country, field hockey, women's rugby, and soccer.[38] On 15 October 2020, U Sports announced it would do the same thing for the winter 2021 portion of the 2020\u201321, once again cancelling all winter national championships as well. Atlantic University Sport, Canada West, and Ontario University Athletics followed suit, suspending all university athletics programs initially through to 31 December 2020, but was later extended through to 31 March 2021, as announced on 15 October 2020.[39][40][41][42][43] The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland had a significant impact on the conduct of sports, affecting both competitive sports leagues and tournaments and recreational sports. The Gaelic games of football, hurling, camogie, and ladies' football saw all competitions suspended from 12 March 2020. The National Hurling League, National Football League, National Camogie League and Ladies' National Football League were suspended, with competitions not intended to resume until 29 March at the earliest.[44] This proved to be an optimistic assumption. In the Philippines, NCAA Season 95 and UAAP Season 82 were both indefinitely suspended.[45][46] NCAA Season 95 was terminated on 19 March after the then community quarantine in Luzon was upgraded to an \"enhanced community quarantine\", in effect a lockdown.[47] UAAP Season 82 was canceled on 7 April, after the enhanced community quarantine was extended to 30 April.[48] On 1 May, the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. (CESAFI) have decided to cancel their 2020 season.[49] On 16 March 2020, British Universities and Colleges Sport, the UK organisation for university sport, announced that all fixtures from 17 March to 1 April would not take place. Some individual events, like the orienteering and windsurfing championships were canceled entirely, while others were postponed indefinitely.[50] On 6 March 2020, in the first round of the NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament, a game played at Johns Hopkins University between Yeshiva University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute became the first U.S. sporting event to be played without fans in attendance, after a student at Yeshiva University tested positive for COVID-19.[51] On 11 March 2020, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) \u2014 the main U.S.A. sanctioning body for college athletics \u2014 initially announced that its winter-semester championships and tournaments, including its popular \"March Madness\" men's basketball tournament and the women's basketball tournament, would be conducted behind closed doors with \"only essential staff and limited family attendance\".[52] The following day, in respect of the suspension of the NBA season and other professional sports leagues, the NCAA announced that all remaining championship events for the 2019\u201320 academic year would be canceled entirely, resulting in the first cancellation in the 81-year history of the NCAA basketball tournament.[53] This created a de facto mythical national championship situation.[54] Other American multi-sports organizations\u2014the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA),[55] National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA),[56] and California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA)[57]\u2014also canceled their seasons. Additionally the Community College level sports governing bodies restored the season of eligibility to athletes who had already participated in the 2020 spring season. On 12 May 2020, because the California State University system announced that in-person classes would remain suspended through the fall 2020 semester, the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA)\u2014a 12-member NCAA Division II conference consisting entirely of CSU campuses[a]\u2014announced that it would also suspend its fall athletics season.[59] The Patriot League, an NCAA Division I conference that competes in the second level of D1 Football, the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), initially announced on 22 June that while it would hold its fall sports seasons, its teams would not fly to any competitions, and overnight travel would only be allowed on a case-by-case basis.[60] Another FCS conference, the Ivy League, announced on 8 July that it was canceling all fall sports, and that winter sports (whose seasons normally begin during the fall academic term) would not begin play until after the end of the fall term. It left open the possibility of shifting its fall sports, including football, to the spring.[61] The Patriot League would later cancel its fall sports season entirely on 13 July, but gave the two federally operated service academies among its membership, Army and Navy, the option to play fall sports as they saw fit. While the academies are full members of the Patriot League, their football teams play outside the conference in the top-level Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).[62] The days following the Ivy League's cancellation of fall sports saw two of the major \"Power Five\" conferences of FBS announce that if fall sports were played, only in-conference matchups would take place. The Big Ten Conference made this announcement on 9 July,[63] with the Pac-12 Conference doing the same the next day.[64] Both conferences later chose to hold abbreviated conference-only football seasons, with the Big Ten starting play on the weekend of 24 October[65] and the Pac-12 on the weekend of 7 November.[66] In August, the NCAA announced that the Division II and Division III Presidents Councils decided to cancel national championships in all fall sports.[67][68] In September, it was announced that 2020 Division I championships administered by NCAA in fall sports (cross country, field hockey, football soccer, women's volleyball and men's water polo) would be rescheduled to spring 2021, and conducted with a 25% reduction in championship participants. Matches played in fall or spring would count toward qualification. The Football Bowl Subdivision was not included as it is not an NCAA-administered championship.[69] In December, the NCAA announced that 2021 Division II championship events in winter and spring sports would also have a 25% overall reduction in participants (individual sports varied from 17 to 34% based on logistics) to mitigate costs of testing and health protocols, as well as lost income.[70] Programs located in the state of New Mexico and in Santa Clara County, California had to relocate practices and games because of legislative bans on any competitive sport requiring physical contact. At the University of New Mexico, the football team moved its first two home games to the sites of their opponents and the last two to Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney, Nevada, in Clark County near Las Vegas; while the men's basketball team moved to Lubbock, Texas and played home games at Lubbock Christian University. New Mexico State moved its men's basketball program to Phoenix, Arizona and used Arizona Christian University as its home court. San Jose State University's football team played its regular-season finale and championship game at Sam Boyd, while the men's basketball team played home games at Kaiser Permanente Arena in Santa Cruz. The same venue hosted early-season home games of the Stanford University and Santa Clara University men's basketball teams.[citation needed] The financial fallout from the pandemic was specifically cited by the following schools in their decisions to drop certain sports programs: Additionally, the New York Institute of Technology suspended its entire athletic program for two seasons, after which it will reconsider the decision.[104] Similarly, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff announced that it was \"suspending\" its men's and women's tennis teams for the 2020\u201321 school year, citing the pandemic, but did not officially eliminate the tennis program.[105] UAH initially dropped men's ice hockey alongside both of its tennis teams, but a successful fundraising drive by alumni and team supporters led the school to reinstate hockey a week later.[106] Similarly, Bowling Green State University announced that it would drop its baseball team,[107] but also had a successful fundraising effort that led to the team being reinstated.[108] The University of Minnesota, which had announced plans to drop four men's sports effective in 2021\u201322, announced that one of these sports, namely outdoor track & field, would be spared discontinuation, pending a further review of the school's sports offerings in spring 2021.[100] The most extensive rollback of plans to drop sports came at the College of William & Mary. In early September 2020, W&M announced it would drop seven sports effective in 2021\u201322\u2014men's and women's gymnastics, men's and women's swimming & diving, men's indoor and outdoor track & field, and women's volleyball.[109] The fallout from this move led the school's athletic director to resign a month after this announcement.[110] W&M eventually reversed course completely, restoring the three women's sports on 19 October[111] and announcing on 5 November that the four men's sports would continue to be sponsored through at least 2021\u201322.[112] MacMurray College, Notre Dame de Namur University, and Urbana University announced that they would wind down operations and close due to economic issues brought upon or exacerbated by the pandemic\u2014effectively ending the entirety of their athletics programs.[113][114][115] In August 2020, officials at the University of California, Riverside, a Division I member, publicly announced that shutting down the school's entire athletic program was one possible option to address pandemic-related financial challenges. As of mid-October, no decision on the program's future had yet been reached.[116] The 2019\u201320 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup ended two weeks earlier after World Cup races in Sweden, Slovenia, and Italy scheduled for March were canceled.[117][118][119] An earlier February World Cup race was moved from China to Austria.[120] The 2020\u201321 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup also saw a number of races in January rescheduled from Wengen to Kitzbühel to Flachau. The opening three stages of the 2020 Archery World Cup were postponed. Other events postponed include the Pan American Archery Championships, which were scheduled to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, from 23 to 29 March, and the European Para-Archery Championships, which were scheduled to be held in Olbia, Italy, from 18 to 26 April.[121] On 15 July it was announced that the 2020 Archery World Cup would be cancelled.

The 2020 Boston Marathon, originally scheduled for 20 April, was postponed until 14 September before being canceled completely on 28 May.[125][126] On 28 October, organisers announced that the 2021 Boston Marathon would not be held on Patriots Day (19 April) as usual, to be rescheduled to sometime in the fall. Organisers cited an ongoing ban on road races in Massachusetts.[127] The race was finally held on 11 October, another fedearal holiday, Columbus Day. The race returned The 2020 London Marathon, scheduled to take place on 26 April, was postponed until 4 October and was restricted to elites only. The London Marathon eventually made a permanent move from April to October.[128] The 2020 Berlin Marathon was prohibited from being held on its originally scheduled dates.[129] It would be cancelled on 24 June. The 2020 New York City Marathon was cancelled.[130] The 2020 Tokyo Marathon was restricted to elite competitors only.[131] The 2021 Tokyo Marathon was postponed to 2022, and the 2022 Tokyo Marathon was cancelled.[132] The 2020 Chicago Marathon was cancelled.[133] The 2020 Rome Marathon was cancelled, as was the Toronto Waterfront Marathon.[134][135] The 2020 Grandma's Marathon, scheduled for 20 June, was canceled by the organizers more than 50 days before it was to begin. They announced on 31 March that the marathon, the half-marathon, and the 5K would all be canceled.[136] Two of the Standard Chartered 2020 marathon series, Hong Kong Marathon and Kuala Lumpur Marathon was cancelled by the organizer over uncertainty of the COVID-19 outbreak.[137][138] Both the 2020 and 2021 editions of the Big Sur International Marathon were cancelled.[139][140] On 2 November 2020, organisers moved the 2021 Publix Atlanta Marathon (typically held inside Fulton County with a primary emphasis of Centennial Olympic Park) 50 km south to the 840 acre Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia (Henry County) where it was held on access roads and campgrounds, finishing inside the speedway oval.[citation needed][k] The 2020 Two Oceans Marathon, scheduled for 8\u201311 April, has been cancelled.[141] The 2021 edition was also cancelled.[142] The 2020 and 2021 Comrades Marathons were cancelled.[143][144] The Atlanta Track Club originally moved the Peachtree Road Race from 4 July to 26 November, but the race was cancelled on 19 August 2020. Organisers then moved the PNC Atlanta 10 Miler, typically held in Atlantic Station, to Michelin Raceway in Hall County, a motorsport closed circuit within a 100 km radius of Atlanta. The race was renamed the PNC Atlanta 10 Miler: Extreme Hills Edition and run exclusively on the road course, pit lane, and driving school courses.[citation needed][k] The 2020 Three Peaks Race, originally scheduled for 25 April, has been postponed to 26 September.[145] At the conclusion of its first round of games (played from 19 to 22 March), the 2020 AFL season was suspended until 11 June, while the finals series of the 2020 AFL Women's season was cancelled after its semi-finals were played, with no premiership awarded.[146] Both the AFL Women's semi-finals and the first round of the AFL season were played in empty stadiums. The 2020 Australian Football International Cup, scheduled to be held between 21 July\u20138 August on the Sunshine Coast, was at first postponed until 2021 and then cancelled altogether.[147] The annual Australian Football Hall of Fame induction event was instead held over four nights as a series of television shows with pre-recorded vision and interviews with the inductees.[148] The AFL Women's best and fairest awards were also changed to be a television only event, with the players being live streamed from their homes.[149] At levels below the fully professional AFL, most leagues either cancelled their entire season[150] or significantly delayed their start.[151] Player payments were cut to zero in the South Australian National Football League.[152] The 2020 AFL season later resumed, however many games, particularly in the early rounds, were played without crowds. The league also reduced playing time by 20%, to four 16-minute quarters instead of 20-minute quarters. Other smaller changes have also been added due to the pandemic. On 28 June, officials in the state of Queensland announced a travel ban to and from the state of Victoria. The AFL then relocated all games scheduled for Victoria to other states for that week and the following week.[153] Then, on 15 July, the AFL announced that all teams based in Victoria would relocate to either Queensland or Western Australia for the rest of the season. This came due to Victoria ordering a six-week lockdown to deal with a surge in cases.[154] On 21 July, the AFL announced an accelerated schedule for Rounds 9 through 12, with games played daily from 29 July to 17 August. Two games were played on selected Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays during this period. In addition, matches were not played in New South Wales due to an increase in coronavirus cases in that state.[155] The remaining games of the 2020 season were played predominantly in Queensland and South Australia, as well as Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Crowd levels were capped, but by the conclusion of the season, crowds of over 20,000 were able to attend games. The 2020 Grand Final was held on 24 October, around a month later than usual, at the Gabba, in Brisbane, Queensland\u2014the first time the Grand Final was played outside of Victoria. In 2021, due to an outbreak of the virus in Victoria,[156] all games in the state in Round 11 had no crowds,[157] and all games were played outside of Victoria in Round 12.[158] Additionally, Round 7 of the VFL and Round 13 of the VFLW were postponed,[159] and in Round 8 of the VFL, only games between non-Victorian teams proceeded as scheduled.[160] As the season wore on, it was becoming increasingly clear that the 2021 Grand Final would not be able to take place in front of a crowd. For the second year in a row, it was relocated, this time to Optus Stadium in Perth. Originally, all scheduled Badminton World Federation tournaments were suspended until 12 April due to coronavirus concerns.[161] The affected tournaments are Swiss Open, India Open, Orléans Masters, Malaysia Open, and Singapore Open. Previously the body had suspended the German Open[162] and pushed the Lingshui China Masters from February to May 2020.[163] The 2020 Thomas & Uber Cup was originally scheduled for 15\u201323 August, but on 29 April was postponed to 3\u201311 October after Denmark extended a ban on \"larger gatherings\" to 31 August. On 15 September, it was again postponed, and on 21 December, it was announced that the tournament would take place on 9\u201317 October 2021. In the end, all tournaments through 11 October were suspended, and World Rankings were frozen from 17 March 2020 to 2 February 2021.

The World Cup final in Norway was cancelled as was the last day of the penultimate World Cup in Finland.[164] Before the races in Finland and Norway, the World Cup races in Nové Město, Czech Republic, 5\u20138 March, were held without spectators.[165][166] The 2020\u201321 Biathlon World Cup changed some locations to minimize travel between venues.[167] The 2020\u201321 IBU Junior Cup and some events of the 2020\u201321 IBU Cup were cancelled.[168] Several competitive events in international competitive bodybuilding on the amateur and professional levels have seen limitations, postponements, or even cancellations due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19.[citation needed] Due to these concerns Ohio governor Mike DeWine reduced the 2020 Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus, Ohio on 3 March, before any cases or deaths had been reported in the state. The cancellation was widely regarded as 'radical' at the time.[169][170] The Fitness Expo (under orders from the state government) held the bodybuilding and physique competitions, including the Arnold Classic, without spectators with exceptions for parents and guardians of minors participating in the competitions.[171] Similar Arnold Sports Festivals planned to be held in Africa, Australia, and South America were postponed for later in the year.[172] On 16 March 2020, Jim Manion, president of the IFBB Professional League and the National Physique Committee announced that competitions planned through to 10 May 2020 in the United States would be postponed for later in the year or canceled until the 2021 season.[173] The 2020 World Outdoor Bowls Championship, scheduled to be held on the Gold Coast from 23 May to 7 June 2020,[174][175] was postponed to 25 May to 6 June 2021 before being officially cancelled on 9 March 2021.[176] In response to the shutdown of extracurricular activities for children in Catalonia, the Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya (CCCC), the governing body for castells (Catalan human towers), issued a statement on 10 March 2020, recommending the suspension of all castells practices and performances.[177] Subsequently, the lockdown imposed throughout Spain shut down all castells activities throughout Catalonia as of 15 March.[178] The postponement to 2022 of the Tarragona Castells Contest, scheduled for 3 and 4 October 2020, was finally announced on 15 July 2020.[179] Another major castells festival, the Festes Decennals de la Mare de Déu de la Candela, held only once every ten years and scheduled for 29 January-7 February 2021, was also postponed. If it is held in 2022 as tentatively planned, it will be the first time since it was founded in 1791 that it will be held in a year not ending in 1.[180] According to the CCCC, the last April without any castells was in 1966.[181] The 44th Chess Olympiad scheduled to take place in Moscow, Russia, from 5\u201317 August 2020 was postponed and rescheduled for the summer of 2021.[182][183] The FIDE Candidates Tournament 2020, held in Yekaterinburg, Russia, was suspended at the mid-point of the tournament on 26 March. FIDE decided to postpone the second half of the tournament after Russia announced it would be interrupting air traffic with other countries starting on 27 March.[184] The 2020 Holmenkollen Ski Festival in Oslo, Norway, part of the 2019\u201320 FIS Cross-Country World Cup, was held on 7\u20138 March, without spectators in the stadium part of the Holmenkollen National Arena.[185] The final two events of the World Cup season, the 2020 Sprint Tour (14\u201317 March, in Quebec City, Canada and Minneapolis, United States) and the 2020 World Cup Finals (20\u201321 March, in Canmore, Canada), were cancelled on 12 and 13 March.[186][187][188] The Swedish Ski Association elected not to send a full squad of skiers and support staff for the first round of the 2020\u201321 FIS Cross-Country World Cup in Rukatunturi, Finland, 27\u201329 November.[189] The second round of the World Cup, to be held in Lillehammer, Norway, 4\u20136 December, was postponed on 12 November, due to the current status of COVID-19 prevention measures, with a new date to be announced later.[190] On 1 December, the Norwegian Ski Federation (NSF) announced that they would not send any skiers to take part in the World Cup events in Davos, Switzerland, and Dresden, Germany, in December, and possibly not take part in the Tour de Ski, which is planned to begin on 1 January 2021. Espen Bjervig, manager of the NSF's cross-country section said the decision was based on \"the risk of travelling, we have experienced that keeping distance and avoiding close contact in the World Cup arena is more demanding than we first assumed\", and that \"endurance athletes have their lungs as a tool, and we do not know the after-effects of COVID-19. Therefore, we must take precautions\".[191] On 2 December, the Swedish Ski Association and the Finnish Ski Association announced that they would mirror Norway's decision, and not send any skiers to the events in Davos and Dresden. International Ski Federation (FIS) marketing director Jürg Capol was critical of the three countries pulling out of the events and said \"We need solidarity. If it's not given it's going to be hard to find (competition) arrangers in the future\", and added that \"Of course all nations must make their own decisions. The problem is not that they can not get to the competitions, but that they themselves have chosen not to go there\".[192] On 4 December, the FIS cancelled the World Cup races in Beijing, China, citing travel restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, \"including a current mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international visitors\" in China. The races were supposed to be held 19\u201321 March, and would have acted as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The FIS said they would be looking for a replacement host for the races.[193] On 9 December, the NSF announced that it would not send any skiers to take part in the 2021 Tour de Ski.[194] The 2021 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, from 22 February to 7 March, in Oberstdorf, Germany, are planned to go ahead as scheduled. The organiser has set a limit of two thousand spectators around the cross-country trails.[195] The curling season typically ends in May but was cut short by the pandemic, effectively ending in early March. The World Curling Federation cancelled the last five championships scheduled for the 2019\u201320 curling season, most importantly the 2020 World Women's Curling Championship, 2020 World Men's Curling Championship, and 2020 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship.[196] The Grand Slam of Curling cancelled its two remaining events of the 2019\u201320 season, the Champions Cup and Players' Championship.[197] For the 2020\u201321 season, Curling Canada postponed the Canada Cup, and cancelled various other events such as the Continental Cup (due to international travel restrictions), Canadian Mixed Curling Championship, Canadian Curling Club Championships, Canadian Junior Curling Championships and Canadian U18 Curling Championships, among others.[198][199] In December 2020, Curling Canada re-located its remaining 2021 championships to a bubble in Calgary, including the 2021 World Men's Curling Championship.[200] On 2 December 2020, the World Curling Federation postponed the 2021 World Wheelchair-B Curling Championship, the inaugural 2021 World Wheelchair Mixed Doubles Curling Championship (although referring to it as a cancellation, World Curling stated that it was exploring rescheduling the event), and cancelled the 2021 World Senior Curling Championships for the second straight year, citing a need to prioritize events with implications on qualification for the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.[201] Due to the cancellation of the 2020 world championships, it was announced that the top six teams in the world men's, women's, and mixed doubles championships would qualify their respective National Olympic Committee for the Olympics (rather than the previous plan of using points earned during the 2020 and 2021 world championships), with a final qualification tournament held in December 2021 to fill the remaining spots.[27] The 2021 World Women's Curling Championship was originally scheduled for Switzerland. After local authorities withdrew their consent to host the tournament there, the World Curling Federation announced 8 February 2021 that the tournament had been cancelled.[202] However, in early-March, the tournament was reinstated after Curling Canada offered to host it within the Calgary bubble as well.[203][204] In between the men's and women's world championships, the Grand Slam of Curling would also hold their previously-cancelled Champions Cup and Players' Championship.[205] The World Curling Championships would present the first disruptions of competition within the bubble due to positive tests. During the men's championship, playoff matches on 10 April were postponed due to multiple positive tests being recorded, including one member of a playoff team (who was already vaccinated, and later rested negative),[206][207] and four among players from eliminated teams. The four tests were later deemed false positives, and play resumed the next day.[208][209][206] Due to positive tests among the host broadcast staff, the World Women's Curling Championship suspended all television coverage from 2\u20136 May, resuming in time for the playoff rounds.[210] Due to the second wave of cases nationwide, in December 2020 USA Curling cancelled its 2020 Seniors Championship, and delayed all of its other national championships to no earlier than May 2021. As this falls after the world championships, USA Curling announced that its berths would therefore be given to the teams that were to represent the United States in 2020.[211][212] The Arena National Championships were later cancelled, and the Junior and Mixed championships were postponed to later in the year.[213][214][215] The 2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials were held in Saskatchewan,[216] whose only restrictions on sporting events by November 2021 were a proof of vaccination requirement for attendees.[217] However, Omicron variant would begin to lead to the cancellations of other events, including the Continental Cup for the second season in a row,[218] as well as the Olympic mixed doubles trials,[219] most provincial playdowns for the 2022 Scotties Tournament of Hearts,[220][221][222] the Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, U Sports/Curling Canada University Curling Championships, Canadian Colleges Athletic Association Curling Championships, and Canadian Wheelchair Curling Championship.[223] The Scotties was held behind closed doors for the second season in a row due to Ontario restrictions,[224][225] with a limited audience of tournament volunteers and local junior curlers from the Thunder Bay area invited to attend the playoff rounds.[226] The 2020 UAE Tour was scheduled to run until 29 February, but was abandoned following stage five after two support staff tested positive for coronavirus. Of the following nineteen 2020 UCI World Tour races scheduled to take place up to 31 May, only Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Paris\u2013Nice, which also had the final day of racing removed, took place at the intended time, some with the stated hope of taking place at a later date. The postponed races in this block include the 2020 Giro d'Italia and four of the five annual monuments, and many lower category races were also cancelled or postponed. Also races of the 2020 UCI Women's World Tour were cancelled or postponed.[227][228][229][230][231][232][233][234][235][236][excessive citations] On 15 March, UCI requested to suspend all UCI-sanctioned events in affected territories until 3 April, and the qualification for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games to stop retroactively as of 3 March.[237] On 18 March, the suspension of events were extended at least until the end of April.[238] On 1 April, the suspension was extended until 1 June,[239] and on 15 April, it was extended until 1 July for the international races, and until 1 August for the UCI World Tour races.[240] On 14 April, the annual Tour de France, originally scheduled for 27 June \u2013 19 July, was postponed due to the country's strict measures with the coronavirus as the government extended a ban on mass gatherings until July.[241] The following day, ASO and UCI rescheduled the race for 29 August to 20 September, and it was ultimately held at that time.[240] A virtual race was conducted every weekend with bikers and teams racing against each other from their homes.[242] A revised calendar for both the men and the women was issued on 5 May, which was updated on 12 June. On 15 July, the first UCI-sanctioned race after the suspension, Dookoła Mazowsza was commenced.[243] The first UCI World Tour race after the suspension was Strade Bianche on 1 August, which was moved from its original schedule in March.[244] On 23 July, the GP de Québec and the GP de Montréal races scheduled for September in Quebec City and Montreal were cancelled.[245] On 9 October Paris-Roubaix, originally scheduled for 25 October, was added to the listed of cancelled races.[246] For the 2021 UCI World Tour, the tour's three events in Australia in January\u2013February (the Tour Down Under, Great Ocean Road Race, and Herald Sun Tour), and also Hamburg Cyclassics (August in Germany), Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec and Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal (September in Canada), Tour of Guangxi (October in China) were cancelled.[247][248][249][250] Paris\u2013Roubaix, originally scheduled in April, was postponed to October.[251] Many UCI ProSeries and continental circuit races were cancelled, some races such as Tour of Qinghai Lake (usually class 2.HC) and Tour of Japan (2.1) downgraded themselves to the class 2.2 and held with domestic teams only during the international travel restrictions. For the 2022 UCI World Tour, the tour's Australian events were once again cancelled due to local restrictions; although the possibility of holding the Great Ocean Road Race later in the season was suggested, it was ultimately cancelled in full due to a lack of available dates.[252][253] The Tour Down Under was replaced in both years by a \"Festival of Cycling\" headlined by races in Australia's National Road Series.[254][255] Race days of the 2020 UCI BMX Supercross World Cup were cancelled including 2 to 3 May in Papendal, the Netherlands.[256] The 2020 UCI BMX World Championships, scheduled to take place in Houston, United States on 26\u201331 May, are postponed.[257] The annual Cape Epic endurance race scheduled from 15 to 22 March was cancelled.[258] The Professional Darts Corporation's European Tour was impacted by the coronavirus; with the 2020 European Darts Grand Prix, the 2020 European Darts Open and the 2020 German Darts Grand Prix all being postponed following restrictions on gatherings implemented by federal governments in Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, respectively. The tournaments were officially cancelled on 29 May, with the PDC announcing the European Tour would downsize from the initial plan of thirteen events to five, including one from before the restrictions came in.[259] The two 2020 Premier League Darts rounds to be held in Rotterdam at the end of March were postponed to September following restrictions on gatherings in the Netherlands; and the round to be held in Newcastle a week earlier was subsequently postponed to October. The next five rounds, in Belfast, Sheffield, Manchester, Berlin and Birmingham were also postponed to later dates, with the Sheffield dates now serving as the Play-Off Round. All ProTour events from 16 March to the end of June were postponed.[260] On 15 July it was announced that the 2020 Premier League Darts rounds which were to be held in Rotterdam, Birmingham, Belfast, Leeds and Berlin would be cancelled, and instead be played at the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes. As well, the Play-offs were shifted back to London. On 17 August the rounds in Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle and Sheffield were cancelled, and instead would also be played at Milton Keynes. Finally on 30 September the Play-offs were moved to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. The 2020 World Matchplay was also relocated to Milton Keynes and held behind closed doors, rather than the usual venue of Blackpool. The 2020 Champions League of Darts was cancelled, and the PDC World Cup of Darts was postponed from June to November and moved from Hamburg, Germany originally to Graz, Austria, before being moved again to Salzburg.[259] The planned first event on the 2020 World Series of Darts, the US Darts Masters, was canceled for 2020, and the 2020 Nordic Darts Masters was originally postponed from June to October before being cancelled on 14 August. The three Australian events The PDC's North American affiliate, the Championship Darts Corporation, cancelled the first weekend of its season in Ontario, and the New Zealand affiliate DartPlayers tour was ended for 2019/20 following the cancellation of events in Queenstown.[259] The 2021 PDC World Darts Championship was initially able to host 1,000 spectators under English \"Tier 2\" restrictions. However, the event was moved behind closed doors after the government announced that London would be moved to Tier 3 restrictions that prohibited indoor gatherings.[261] Impact of the pandemic on esports have primarily affected events and leagues that host competitions in-person (typically to reduce latency between players that can impact games played over the internet, and to allow for an in-person audience in a similar fashion to traditional sporting events), which led to cancellations and postponements, and competitions being held behind closed doors\u2014either in the traditional sense, or with competition being conducted entirely over the internet rather than in-person, with streaming broadcasts (as are typical for esports).[262][263][264] Sportcal suggested that the esports industry had an opportunity to attract mainstream sports fans as a \"viable alternative\" to traditional sporting events.[265] Roundhill Investments CEO Will Hershey predicted that games that are straightforward for casual viewers to understand (such as sports games) could see particular interest among this new audience.[263] The suspension of sports competitions allowed professional athletes to increase their involvement in video game streaming as a means to engage with fans.[263] Esports organisations also invited professional athletes to compete in specific competitions (often alongside, or in competition with professional players); FaZe Clan organized a charity Call of Duty: Warzone pro-am entitled \"Fight 2 Fund\" in support of COVID-19-related charities, where professional players were partnered with celebrity participants (such as Ben Simmons, Chad Johnson, and JuJu Smith-Schuster),[263] and several sim racing competitions similarly invited professional race drivers.[266][267] Some sports teams took advantage of sports games in a similar manner, such as the Phoenix Suns holding NBA 2K20 streams with guest players, between the teams the Suns were scheduled to play that night if the NBA season had continued.[268][269] This culminated with a game being broadcast by the team's radio commentators on team flagship KMVP-FM.[269] The NFL canceled its 2021 Pro Bowl game and replaced it with a Madden NFL 21 event, featuring NFL players and other celebrities controlling the Pro Bowl roster (voted on by fans as normal) in a \"virtual\" Pro Bowl game.[270] Sports broadcasters also took advantage of esports as a form of replacement programming, with leagues partnering to hold televised tournaments in sports games featuring their players, or in some cases (such as ESPN2 simulcasting the 2020 League of Legends Championship Series) acquiring professional esports events to air on television.[271][272] The IndyCar Series and NASCAR announced partnerships with sim racing platform iRacing to hold online invitational events featuring series regulars.[273][274] The inaugural eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series event drew a television audience of 903,000 on Fox Sports 1\u2014making it the most-watched esports broadcast on U.S. linear television since a 2016 Mortal Kombat X tournament aired by The CW. This record was surpassed the following week with a Texas Motor Speedway race \u2014 also aired by the main Fox network \u2014 which attracted 1.339 million viewers.[275] After being well-received, a second, 10-event eNASCAR iRacing series was announced for 2021, mainly to fulfill television inventory with its media partners Fox and NBC (as NASCAR has continued its COVID-19 protocol of not holding practice or qualifying sessions at events). The series runs on selected Wednesday nights during the NASCAR season, primarily featuring existing tracks with a change to their surface or vehicle configuration.[276] On 3 March 2020, the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) issued its first bulletin on COVID-19 precautions.[277] On 10 March FIE strongly recommended that all participants in its competitions (athletes and other members of national delegations) fill and carry with them a questionnaire about their health status.[278] On 12 March a FIE circular reported the postponement of six World Cup or Grand Prix competitions and the World Junior/Cadet Championship.[279] Since the World Cup and Grand Prix events were part of the qualifications for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the circular warned on the need to postpone the zonal qualifications tournament for the Olympics. No news was given on other events, and their possible postponement or cancellation.[citation needed] FIE reported on its web site[280] the postponement of the Olympic Games, but hasn't yet given any information on the World Fencing Championships, which is supposed to happen in non-Olympic years, so there is a 2021 Championship planned (assigned to Cairo), but not a 2020 Championship.[citation needed] Individual countries had different decisions. For example, on 4 April the Federazione Italiana Scherma announced it was suspending all competitions until 31 August.[281] Many field hockey leagues in Europe have been suspended or curtailed, including in Spain,[282] England,[283] Germany,[284] and the Netherlands.[285] The 2019\u201320 Euro Hockey League Final 8 and 2020 Euro Hockey League Women seasons were suspended on 12 March.[286] The 2020 Men's EuroHockey Club Trophy I, 2020 Men's EuroHockey Club Trophy II, 2020 Boys' EuroHockey Youth Championships, and 2020 Girls' EuroHockey Youth Championships were cancelled.[287][288] In Asia, the 2020 Men's Hockey Junior Asia Cup, 2020 Women's Asian Champions Trophy, and 2020 Women's Hockey Junior Asia Cup were postponed.[289][290] The 2020 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup was originally postponed to 24 September.[291] But on 2 May the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup was officially cancelled.[292] The 2020 World Junior Championships, held on 2\u20138 March in Tallinn, Estonia, were the last major event to be held amid rising concerns about the pandemic. All remaining events on the season calendar, including the World Championships, were cancelled. The 2020 World Championships, originally scheduled for 16\u201322 March 2020 in Montreal, Canada, were first postponed on 11 March by the Quebec Health Ministry.[293] On 12 April 2020, ISU Vice-president for Figure Skating, Alexander Lakernik, told media that the chances of rescheduling the championship were slim, due to the ongoing pandemic.[294] The ISU confirmed a complete cancellation of the event, with no chance of postponement to a later date, on 16 April 2020.[295] The 2020\u201321 ISU Junior Grand Prix series was cancelled on 20 July 2020.[296] Over half of the events of the 2020\u201321 ISU Challenger Series were either also cancelled by the host federations or postponed to an unspecified later date. The Challenger Series events were held as individual events, and thus did not award prize money based on overall series rank. The 2020\u201321 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating events were heavily modified to accommodate ongoing travel restrictions and the series' culminating event, the 2020\u201321 Grand Prix Final, was postponed from its original date of 10\u201313 December in Beijing, China.[297] On 14 October 2020, the second event in the Grand Prix series, the 2020 Skate Canada International, was cancelled by the host federation.[298] On 19 October 2020, the fourth event in the series, the 2020 Internationaux de France, was also cancelled.[299] In November, the Grand Prix Final was first removed from being held in China altogether, before being definitively cancelled on 10 December 2020.[300][301] On 16 October 2020, the ISU announced the cancellation of the 2021 Four Continents Championships.[302] On 24 November 2020, the 2021 World Junior Championships were also cancelled.[303] On 10 December 2020, the 2021 European Championships became the third ISU Championships event of the season to be cancelled.[301] The 2021 World Championships were held as scheduled despite concerns from athletes, fans, and media, with COVID-19 protocols in place.[304] During the event, two athletes and an unknown third person tested positive for COVID-19, with at least one other athlete testing positive in the weeks following the competition.[305][306] Several countries postponed or cancelled their national championships. U.S. Figure Skating relocated the 2021 U.S. Championships to be able to create an isolated bubble environment similar to that of 2020 Skate America, both of which were held at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas.[307] Due to skaters' limited availability to travel to competitions, the ISU announced that ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking points would not be awarded at early season events, including the ISU Challenger Series and the ISU Grand Prix. Scores earned at the domestic Grand Prix events also did not count as official ISU scores for the purposes of achieving minimum TES requirements or as personal/season's bests.[308] The 2021\u201322 ISU Junior Grand Prix series was largely held as scheduled \u2013 the second event was relocated from Canada to France \u2013 but several countries were unable to attend certain stops due to travel restrictions, resulting in the creation of a reallocation process for quota spots on a case-by case basis.[309][310][311] Other federations, including the Japan Skating Federation and the Chinese Skating Association, chose to forego the series entirely.[312] Similarly, the 2021\u201322 ISU Challenger Series was also able to largely take place as scheduled, with the exception of the cancelled 2021 CS Nepela Memorial; however, several events were unable to attract a sufficient number of entries to qualify Challenger status. On 16 August 2021, the ISU announced the cancellation of 2021 Cup of China, citing the limited number of international flights to China and strict COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.[313] The ISU announced the 2021 Gran Premio d'Italia as the replacement event on 27 August after asking for applications from alternate hosts.[314] On 2 December, the ISU announced the postponement of the 2021\u201322 Grand Prix Final and Junior Grand Prix Final in Osaka, due to travel restrictions imposed by the Japanese government in response to the newly discovered Omicron variant. The ISU left open the possibility that the event could be rescheduled near the end of the season,[315] but ultimately announced on 17 December that the Grand Prix had been cancelled in full, as it was \"impossible to find a solution to maintain this Event\".[316] On 13 September 2021, the Chinese Skating Association withdrew from hosting the 2022 Four Continents Championships.[317] The proximity of the event in timing and location to the 2022 Winter Olympics raised questions over whether the Olympics could be safely held by China.[318] The ISU again asked for other ISU members to apply as alternative hosts. After receiving no applications from eligible members, the ISU relocated the event \u2013 intended for non-European skaters \u2013 to Tallinn, Estonia, the host of the 2022 European Championships, with the intent to hold Four Continents in the same venue on its original dates (a week after Europeans).[319] Several countries postponed or cancelled their national championships, including Australia and China, for a second consecutive season. On 9 March 2020, FIFA and AFC announced that the 2020 AFC Futsal Championship in Ashgabat was postponed to 5\u201316 August.[320][321][322] On 17 March, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) confirmed that the opening fixture of the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship\u2014due to have taken place at Gaelic Park in The Bronx on 3 May\u2014had been postponed.[323] Many elite golf tournaments, both professional and amateur, have either been postponed or canceled in response to the pandemic, including the major championships.[324] On 13 March, it was announced that the Masters Tournament (scheduled for 9\u201312 April) had been postponed.[325][326] The 2020 PGA Championship (scheduled for 11\u201317 May) was postponed the following week.[327] On 6 April, The R&A announced the cancellation of the 2020 Open Championship, the first cancellation since World War II.[328] This was soon followed by the USGA announcing the rescheduling of the 2020 U.S. Open from 18 to 21 June to 17\u201320 September (the week before the 2020 Ryder Cup, which itself was postponed for a year when organizers chose cancellation to playing the event behind closed doors[329]) and to 12\u201315 November for the Masters (the first ever iteration of the tournament to be played in November) and 6\u20139 August for the PGA Championship.[330] The ladies majors have been similarly affected, with the LPGA Tour postponing the ANA Inspiration until September.[331] On 12 March 2020, midway through the first round of the 2020 Players Championship, the PGA Tour announced that the remainder of the tournament and the next three events, the Valspar Championship, WGC Match Play, and the Valero Texas Open, would continue without fan attendance. Subsequently, after completion of the day's play, the tour decided to cancel the remainder of tournament and the three following events.[332][333] On 17 March, the tour announced the cancellation of all scheduled tournaments through 10 May.[334] The European Tour have also cancelled or postponed many tournaments, mostly those scheduled from mid-March through to the end of May,[335] including the Irish Open, a Rolex Series event.[336] The Ladies European Tour originally postponed the 2020 Evian Championship, originally scheduled for 23\u201326 July, to 6\u20139 August,[337] but on 9 June announced that the tournament (one of two women's majors outside of the United States) had been cancelled.[338] The Women's Open Championship was still played, despite the cancellation of its parent men's event.[339] Other leading professional tours have announced similar measures, as have the bodies responsible for organising leading amateur events.[324] On 1 April, the R&A and the USGA jointly announced that the Curtis Cup was being postponed until 2021, and the British men's and women's amateur championships were being rescheduled from June to August.[340] The LPGA Tour have canceled three tournaments and postponed five others including the ANA Inspiration,[331][324] and the Japan LPGA Tour cancelled twelve tournaments scheduled from March into May.[341] On 16 April 2020, the PGA Tour announced a condensed schedule for a proposed resumption of play on 11 June with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas. It aims to play most of the remaining tournaments of the 2019\u201320 season (preserving at least three quarters of the original schedule in total), concluding with the FedEx Cup Playoffs and the season-ending Tour Championship on Labor Day weekend, followed immediately by the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season (which will have a modified early-season schedule to accommodate the rescheduled majors) with the Safeway Open. Officials planned the events behind closed doors, although most events were held at courses with residences and/or rental units, and residents were allowed to \"attend\" the events from their yards on their property, or in the case of the RBC Heritage, from boats traveling the Calibogue Sound. Spectators were expected to return for the Memorial Tournament, but on 14 July it was announced that the remaining tournaments of the 2019\u201320 season would be played behind closed doors. The extra delay was intended to give the Tour more time for preparations, as well as take advantage of weeks opened by the cancellation and postponements of majors and the Summer Olympics; only one of the three remaining majors\u2014the PGA Championship\u2014fell within the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season's schedule.[342][343] The Sanford International in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a PGA Tour Champions event in September, became the first PGA Tour-sanctioned event to allow spectators since the pandemic. The Corales Puntacana Resort and Club Championship became the first tournament with a pro-am since the pandemic, the 2020 Bermuda Championship was the first tournament with spectators on the premier tour (500 spectators per day), and the Houston Astros Foundation's Vivint Houston Open was the first domestic tournament to allow spectators (2,000 per day). The PGA Tour then began allowing spectators at the Phoenix Open in February 2021, where by March all PGA Tour events were open to spectators. A charity skins game, TaylorMade Driving Relief, was held 17 May at Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach, Florida, featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff; simulcast by NBC, Golf Channel, and NBCSN, it was the first televised event at Seminole, and the first in the United States since the suspension of PGA Tour play.[344][345] A sequel to Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson's 2018 match play event The Match, The Match: Champions for Charity, was announced for 24 May in a simulcast across WarnerMedia Entertainment networks, with the two participating in a four-ball match at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida, with NFL quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady as their respective partners.[346] Fox Sports opted out of its 12-year contract to broadcast the championships of the USGA and sold the rights to NBC Sports, with reports suggesting that Fox did not want to work around programming conflicts with its NFL and college football coverage, and that the USGA vetoed a proposal to move the tournament entirely to pay television channel Fox Sports 1.[347][348] Recreational golf has also been affected, with many countries and regions ordering the closure of golf clubs and courses.[349][350][351] To enforce social distancing, regulations may require golf clubs to stagger tee times or restrict how services such as pro shops and golf carts are used. The game was played under no-touch rules. Ball washers and bunker rakes were decommissioned and \"pin in\" rules were placed on the green. To accommodate no-touch golf, holes were modified with an elevated rim or made shallow with a piece of foam (most often a cut pool noodle) or drain pipe or a safety plate. Some courses deployed a lift system that could be lifted with a putter head. If the edge of the hole was above the ground level, the ball is deemed to have been holed if the ball comes in contact with the raised rim or cylinder.[352][353][354] On 5 June 2021, after completion of the third round of the Memorial Tournament on the PGA Tour, Jon Rahm was notified that he had tested positive for COVID-19. Rahm was leading the Memorial Tournament by 6 strokes before having to withdraw due to Tour protocols. Rahm became the first positive, asymptomatic case as part of the tour's routine, contact-tracing protocols.[355] In 2022, the 2022 LPGA Tour cancelled the Buick LPGA Shanghai, while the WGC tour cancelled the HSBC Champions, both set for China in the autumn. The CJ Cup, originally planned for South Korea, will be moved to the Savannah, Georgia region for the 2023 tournament in October 2022. The Savannah areah already hosts the RBC Heritage in April, with a tournament in Gillisonville, which for the second consecutive year hosts a replacement tournament. (The Palmetto Championship was held in Gillisonville as a replacement for the RBC Canadian Open in 2021.) The 2020 English Greyhound Derby was postponed on 16 March.[356] The Arena Racing Company tracks announced a behind closed doors policy from 24 March[357] and racing in Ireland continued behind closed doors.[358] Subsequently, all racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland was postponed[359] until 1 June. On 12 June it was announced that the 2020 English Greyhound Derby will be run on 31 October. Multiple international artistic gymnastics competitions, many of which were Olympic qualifying events, were either canceled or postponed. On 13 March, after already having completed qualifications, the Baku World Cup canceled its event finals.[360] The Stuttgart, Birmingham, and Tokyo World Cups (scheduled to take place between 21 March \u2013 5 April) were all postponed to 2021.[361][362][363] The 2020 European Women's Championships (scheduled to take place 30 April \u2013 3 May in Paris, France) and the 2020 European Men's Championships (scheduled to take place 27\u201331 May in Baku, Azerbaijan) were both cancelled.[364] They were later both rescheduled to be held on 17\u201320 December and 9\u201313 December, respectively, in Mersin, Turkey after Baku considered hosting the replacement competitions.[365] Originally Olympic qualifying events, the competitions were undesignated as such in light of the ongoing pandemic, so as to avoid pressuring member federations to attend if they were not willing to do so.[366] The Pacific Rim Championships (scheduled to take place 17\u201319 April in Tauranga, New Zealand) was postponed until April 2021.[367] On 2 September 2020, Gymnastics New Zealand announced that it was withdrawing from hosting and cancelled the competition.[368] The 25\u201329 March, 2020 European Women's Handball Championship qualification matches in Rotterdam, the Netherlands were cancelled.[369] The 2021 World Men's Handball Championship took place as planned, albeit without spectators,[370] and was soon affected in that several teams withdrew before and during the championship.[371][372] Horse racing is one sport that has been less directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than most others; some countries and regions never stopped operating horse racing events, and racing was one of the first sports to be resumed in other regions. In the early stages of the outbreak, most horse racing events remained scheduled as normal, but with restricted attendance at racecourses. This included Hong Kong, France,[373] Japan,[374] United Arab Emirates,[375] United States, Australia,[376] Ireland,[377] United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, and Singapore. The Macau Jockey Club suspended racing events from 31 January to 15 February and resumed racing from 22 February. The Korea Racing Authority suspended horse racing from 8 March. Sunland Park Racetrack in the United States canceled its race meeting from 16 March, which included the Sunland Derby, part of the 2020 Road to the Kentucky Derby.[378] Many tracks in North America followed suit over the following weeks, although some remained open depending on state-by-state decisions. In Britain, although the Cheltenham Festival proceeded as normal in mid-March,[379] the Grand National meeting at Aintree in April was cancelled.[380] By mid-March Ireland had become the only major horse racing country in Europe where the sport continued, albeit strictly regulated and behind closed doors.[381] Ireland finally closed down racing on 25 March.[382] Churchill Downs announced that the 2020 Kentucky Derby, normally the first leg of the American Triple Crown, would be delayed to 5 September.[383][384] They had hoped to run the rescheduled race before a live (though reduced) crowd \u2013 this plan was eventually abandoned due to an increase in cases in the Louisville area.[385] The change in dates for the Derby caused a cascading effect through the 2020 racing schedule, with the Maryland Jockey Club delaying the 2020 Preakness Stakes to 3 October. The Belmont Stakes, normally the third leg of the Triple Crown, was run at a shortened distance of 1+1\u20448 miles on 20 June as the first leg.[386] On 22 March, it was announced that the Dubai World Cup, due to celebrate its 25th anniversary running on 28 March, had been cancelled.[387] On 7 April, Jockey Club Racecourses announced that the first four Classics of the British flat racing season \u2013 the 2000 and 1000 Guineas, scheduled to be held on 2\u20133 May, and the Epsom Oaks and Derby, scheduled to be held on 5\u20136 June \u2013 would be postponed until later in the season. Ascot Racecourse also announced that Royal Ascot, scheduled to be held from 16 to 20 June, would take place behind closed doors if it gets the go-ahead.[388][389] To reduce the risk of transmission, horsemen may be limited from traveling to some racecourses or other horse racing facilities.[390] Hong Kong-based jockey Keith Yeung felt unwell on 22 March night, but his test for COVID-19 PCR was negative.[391] On 26 March, jockey Javier Castellano was the first American-based jockey to announce that he had tested positive.[392] In July, fifteen jockeys in the Del Mar riding colony tested positive, forcing a brief closure of the Del Mar meeting.[393] Some stakes races' prize money were reduced.
