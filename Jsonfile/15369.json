{"Content: ":"As of July 2022,[update] the global COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, but the disease may shift from a pandemic stage to an endemic stage in the future.[1][2] COVID-19 has been declared endemic by the prime ministers of Mexico[3] and Vietnam.[4] On 14 April 2022, the World Health Organization said that COVID-19 is far from becoming an endemic disease and could still trigger large outbreaks around the globe.[1] In June 2022, an article in Human Genomics said that the pandemic was \"still raging\" but \"now is the time to explore the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase. The latter will require worldwide vigilance and cooperation, especially in emerging countries\", and suggested that developed countries should assist in boosting vaccination rates worldwide.[2] At a media conference on 22 December 2021, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said that \"we are living with this virus. This is the next stage of the pandemic.\" She noted that only one person was hospitalized with COVID-19 in Queensland and encouraged continued masking and booster shots for those eligible.[5] Queensland's Chief Health Officer John Gerrard said that spreading COVID-19 is \"necessary\" to transition from the \"pandemic stage to an endemic stage\", noting that people can develop immunity by being vaccinated or getting infected.[5] In early March 2022, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said that the country is looking to downgrade COVID-19 to the status of an endemic.[6] In September 2021, Malaysian Minister of Health Khairy Jamaluddin announced that the government would transition to treating COVID-19 as if it was in an \"endemic phase\" by the end of October 2021, after vaccinating 80% of the population.[7][8] Movement controls in the country were lifted in October.[9] In March 2022, Khairy said that Malaysians could start \"to live with COVID-19\", while maintaining some public health measures.[10] On April 26 2022, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that COVID-19 was \"retreating almost completely\" and had moved on to an endemic stage.[3] In February 2022, the Philippines Department of Health began shifting toward the endemic phase of COVID-19, despite caution from the WHO that it may be too early to declare. During a media briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the \"transition to an endemic state for COVID-19 does not mean that the government would stop its interventions or even remove minimum health protocols such as masking, physical distancing, and hand sanitation.\" WHO Acting Philippine Representative Rajendra Yadav said that while the continued drop in the number of new cases is \"encouraging,\" the country should be careful in moving from the \"acute phase\" of the pandemic.[11] In June 2021, Gan Kim Yong, Ong Ye Kung and Lawrence Wong\u2014chairs of Singapore's COVID-19 task force\u2014stated that \"COVID-19 may never go away\", but that due to high vaccination rates, a roadmap was being developed for how the city state could eventually live \"normally with [COVID-19] in our midst\", and manage it as an endemic disease, which would include:[12][13] They stated that \"Science and human ingenuity will eventually prevail over COVID-19. Cohesion and social consciousness will get us there faster. We must all do our part.\"[12][13] Shortly after the plans were revealed, however, outbreaks tied to the Delta variant began to emerge, leading the Singapore government to reintroduce restrictions on gatherings. In October 2021, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong admitted that it would take at least six months to reach a \"new normal\", but that Singapore's high vaccination rates and low mortality meant that COVID-19 \"has become a treatable, mild disease for most of us\", the impact of COVID-19 variants had made a COVID-Zero strategy less feasible, and that maintaining restrictions would impact the economy and mental health of the country.[15][16] On 17 January 2022, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish government was exploring how and when the management of the COVID-19 pandemic would shift to the management of the coronavirus as an endemic illness, saying that \"the virus is no longer so deadly\".[17] The following day, Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO stated that the pandemic was \"nowhere near over\", warning that new variants were still \"likely to emerge\".[18] In a preview of his policy changes in early February 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom said that the state of California would embrace an endemic response, elaborating that \"In that endemic plan, we will be able to answer a lot of questions you have about what world are we living in, where are we going with this virus\".[19] On 17 February 2022, he announced a formal shift in the state's management of COVID-19, saying, \"we are moving past the crisis phase into a phase where we will work to live with this virus\". This change was described as the first endemic management policy in the US. Most remaining state mask mandates were lifted by April 2022,[20] and a federal mask mandate for public transport was struck down by the District Court for the Middle District of Florida for exceeding the authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[21] On 26 April 2022, Chief Medical Advisor to the President and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAD) Anthony Fauci argued that the United States was \"out of the pandemic phase\".[22] The following day, Fauci stated that the country was in a \"transitional phase\" into \"hopefully a more controlled phase and endemicity\", but that \"the world is still in a pandemic\", and the United States could still see new waves of infection. Fauci's comments followed a report from the CDC indicating that the United States had a much higher level of collective immunity due to the Omicron variant.[23] On 16 May 2022, Joseph Wendelken, a spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Health, observed that COVID-19 was \"an endemic disease\" and said, \"we should expect moderate increases and decreases in our COVID-19 levels over the coming months.\"[24] On 31 May 2022, Albert Bryan, governor of the United States Virgin Islands, similarly stated that COVID-19 had entered an endemic phase, as \"we now have the tools and information necessary to protect ourselves from a serious illness.\"[25] On June 14, 2022, Vermont's Health Commissioner Mark Levine described COVID-19 as endemic and stated that \"COVID-19 is still with us and will continue to evolve, but so has our knowledge of the virus and how to respond,\" and went on to encourage the use of at-home tests. Acknowledging declining positivity rates, the state's Governor Phil Scott stressed the importance of socialization and strengthening communities.[26][27] In March 2022, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính said COVID-19 was \"endemic\" and considered ending daily reporting of new cases.[4]","Title":"Endemic phase of COVID-19 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15369","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_phase_of_COVID-19"}
