The total area is 29.14 km² which gives a population density of 898 inhabitants per km². Inhabitants consider their hometown to be a \"Weireldstad\" (metropolis), which also led to a monthly \"Harelbekedag\" amongst the students of Harelbeke studying in Ghent.[citation needed] In Harelbeke a museum remembers the life and work of musician and composer Peter Benoit, called the Peter Benoit Huis.[2] This cemetery is located just outside the downtown of Harelbeke and was designed by Willian Harrison Cowlishaw[3] and contains the graves of 1126 Commonwealth soldiers who died during WWI (1055 from the UK, 26 from Canada, 7 from Australia, 4 from South Africa and 3 from Newfoundland). In addition 10 British soldiers who died during WWII are buried here.
