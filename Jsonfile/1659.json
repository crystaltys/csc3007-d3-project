{"Content: ":"Crinozoa is a subphylum of mostly sessile echinoderms, of which the crinoids, or sea lilies, are the only extant members. Crinozoans have an extremely extensive fossil history, which may or may not extend into the Precambrian (provided the enigmatic Ediacaran Arkarua can be positively identified as an edrioasteroid). The classes currently contained within Crinozoa include Crinoidea, Cystoidea, Edrioasteroidea, and Rhombifera.  This echinoderm-related article is a stub.
