{"Content: ":"The NHS Nightingale Hospital Birmingham was the second of the temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals set up by NHS England to help to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. It was constructed inside the National Exhibition Centre, Solihull, and opened on 16 April 2020.[1] As of 30 August it had not treated any patients.[2] On 1 April 2021 the hospital was closed without ever treating a patient.[3] To add extra critical care capacity during the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK, and to treat those with COVID-19, plans were made to create further temporary hospital spaces for those in need of treatment and care.[4][5] They have been named \"Nightingale Hospitals\", after Florence Nightingale who came to prominence for nursing soldiers during the Crimean War and is regarded as the founder of modern nursing.[6] The hospital was announced as operational on 10 April 2020,[7] and was scheduled to receive its first patients on 12 April, to help Midlands hospitals cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.[8][9] It will support 23 Midlands hospitals by taking patients who are convalescing from having COVID-19, patients who are require less intensive treatment, and patients who need palliative care.[8] It is intended to relieve pressure on conventional hospitals where the most seriously ill patients are treated.[8] It is the second temporary 'Nightingale Hospital' to be built in England,[8] following NHS Nightingale London, that opened on 3 April 2020 in the ExCeL London exhibition and convention centre.[10] It falls under the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust.[8] The hospital occupies halls 8-12 and 16 of the NEC, connected via the Atrium.[11] It had 496 beds divided into four wards from day one, with the option to expand to 800 immediately if needed.[12] Should things worsen a phase two is envisaged that would bring the number of beds in use up to 2,000.[12] In the worst-case scenario 4,000 beds would be available.[12] The hospital was formally opened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, via remote video link, on 16 April.[13] It will include a new Tesco store exclusively for the use of its staff.[14] The following have been involved in the creation of the hospital:","Title":"NHS Nightingale Hospital Birmingham - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11320","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Nightingale_Hospital_Birmingham"}
