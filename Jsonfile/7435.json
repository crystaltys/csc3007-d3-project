{"Content: ":"Golden Age of Russian Poetry (or Age of Pushkin) is the name traditionally applied by philologists to the first half of the 19th century.[1] The most significant Russian poet Pushkin (in Nabokov's words, the greatest poet this world was blessed with since the time of Shakespeare[2]) and other famous poets worked during this time. Mikhail Lermontov and Fyodor Tyutchev are generally regarded as two most important Romantic poets after Pushkin.[3] Other poets include Pyotr Vyazemsky, Anton Delvig, Kondraty Ryleyev. The best-regarded of Pushkin's precursor Vasily Zhukovsky and Konstantin Batyushkov may be also included. Pushkin himself, however, considered Evgeny Baratynsky to be the finest poet of his day.[citation needed] Vasily Zhukovsky Alexander Pushkin Evgeny Baratynsky Mikhail Lermontov This Russia-related article is a stub.
