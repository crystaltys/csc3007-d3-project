{"Content: ":"Hygiene theater is the practice of taking hygiene measures that are intended to give the illusion of improved safety while doing little to actually reduce any risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hygiene theater has often been performed by retail businesses in an effort to ameliorate concerns of potential customers, while actually doing little to mitigate the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] One of the first written uses of the term was in a March 6, 2020, blog post by Bob Cooney, a recreational virtual-reality consultant,[8] in which he said that VR-arcade operators should \"practice hygiene theater\" for customers as the COVID-19 pandemic began.[9] Even earlier written use was in a listener's comment on April 29, 2020, on radio personality Tom Leykis's website.[10] On July 27, 2020, Derek Thompson, a staff writer for The Atlantic, used the term when referring to hygiene measures being taken during the COVID-19 pandemic that have done little to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and have provided a false sense of security.[1][3] Measures taken against COVID-19 that have been referred to as hygiene theater include deep cleaning (aside from in hospitals), temperature checks, plexiglass barriers, and the spraying of disinfectants by humans and robots.[1][2][3][5] Cleaning and disinfection measures have persisted despite widespread recognition that SARS-CoV-2 rarely, if ever, spreads through surface contact.[7][11] In the United States, many forms of hygiene theater were still in use in some establishments in June 2021.[12] Organizations such as the Kennedy Center continued to deploy temperature checks, even while acknowledging that the benefits were psychological, not medicinal.[12] However, amidst the general reopening of the US, the specifics of what practices were done were varied enormously, as companies updated rules and continued to adapt to customer behavior.[12] This article about the COVID-19 pandemic is a stub.
