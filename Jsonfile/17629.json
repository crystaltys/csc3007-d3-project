{"Content: ":"The Governor of the Cayman Islands is the representative of the British monarch in the United Kingdom's overseas territory of the Cayman Islands. The Governor, a civil servant who has in modern times typically been a British subject normally resident in the United Kingdom, is appointed by the monarch from the staff of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on the advice of the British government. The role of the Governor is to act as the de facto head of state, and is responsible for appointing the Premier, who is the leader of the party with a majority of seats in the Legislature. The Governorship is held by Martyn Roper since October 2018.[1] The Governor has his own flag, the Union Flag defaced with the territory's coat of arms. The official residence of the Governor is Government House in Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman. Until 1962, the Cayman Islands were administered as a dependency of Jamaica. When Jamaica gained independence, the Islands were split and became a separate Crown colony. An Administrator was appointed to the Islands from 1959. After 1971, the British Government appointed a Governor.","Title":"Governor of the Cayman Islands - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17629","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_the_Cayman_Islands"}
