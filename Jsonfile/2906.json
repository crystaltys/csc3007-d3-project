{"Content: ":"Sugarland is an American country music duo founded in Atlanta, Georgia. The duo consists of singer-songwriters Jennifer Nettles (lead vocals) and Kristian Bush (vocals, guitar, mandolin). They were founded in 2002, at which point Kristen Hall (vocals, guitar) was also a member. All three had experience in folk rock: Nettles had recorded in the groups Soul Miner's Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band, Bush had recorded two albums as one-half of the duo Billy Pilgrim, and Hall had recorded two solo albums. After Hall left in 2006, Nettles and Bush continued as a duo. Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2004, Sugarland recorded four studio albums, one Christmas album, and one live album for that label between then and 2010. These albums accounted for fifteen singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the number-one singles \"Want To\", \"Settlin'\", \"All I Want to Do\", \"Already Gone\", and \"It Happens\". Nettles was also a featured vocalist on rock band Bon Jovi's late 2005-early 2006 single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which also topped the country music charts. Their four studio albums for this label \u2014 Twice the Speed of Life, Enjoy the Ride, Love on the Inside, and The Incredible Machine \u2014 are all certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The duo went on hiatus in 2012, during which time both Nettles and Bush recorded solo albums. They reunited officially in 2017 for Bigger, a studio album issued on Big Machine Records. Nettles, Bush, and Hall were regulars in Atlanta's folk-rock scene in the 1990s and early 2000s before Sugarland was formed, playing frequently at Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia, which Nettles' ex-husband owned for a time. Sugarland's debut album, Twice the Speed of Life, was released October 26, 2004. Serving as its lead-off single was the song \"Baby Girl,\" which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts and set a record for the longest chart run since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990; it was also the highest-peaking debut single for a group in 13 years. Also released from the album were the singles \"Something More\", \"Just Might (Make Me Believe),\" and \"Down in Mississippi (Up to No Good),\" which peaked on the country charts at No. 2, No. 7, and No. 17, respectively. The album received Multi-Platinum certification for sales of three million copies, becoming their first album to achieve that status. In late 2005, the trio performed with Bon Jovi on Country Music Television's musical fusion show, Crossroads. Nettles sang with Bon Jovi on their single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home.\" The song later went on to become a No. 1 hit on the country charts.
