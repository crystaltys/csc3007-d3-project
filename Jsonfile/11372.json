He recommended that Malaysia need a minimum of six weeks for the virus containment to work.[3] On April 9, he also said that the MCO should be extended due to the low level of public understanding and compliance of Malaysia in the fight against COVID-19.[4] On April 12, Awang Bulgiba also said that the MCO could be ended if the number of new cases continues to decline and the numbers of recovered exceeds those of new cases.[5]","Title":"Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11372","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awang_Bulgiba_Awang_Mahmud"}
