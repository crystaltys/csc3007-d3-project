{"Content: ":"The following is a timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Notes:  On 30 January, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Rome. A Chinese couple, originally from Wuhan, who had arrived in Italy on 23 January via Milan Malpensa Airport, travelled from the airport to Verona, then to Parma, arriving in Rome on 28 January. The next afternoon, they developed a cough, and by evening the man had a fever; the couple were taken to the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases where they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised.[2][3] On 2 February, a team from the same institute composed of scientists Maria Rosaria Capobianchi, Francesca Colavita, and Concetta Castilletti isolated the genomic sequence of the virus and uploaded it to GenBank.[4][5] On 30 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency with the duration of six months. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was the first EU country to take this kind of precautionary measure.[6] The government also introduced thermal scanners and temperature checks on international passengers arriving at Italian airports.[7] On 6 February, an Italian man evacuated from Wuhan tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in Italy to three.[8] On 22 February, the evacuated Italian man recovered and was discharged from the hospital.[9] On 22 and 26 February, the two previously infected Chinese tourists tested negative for COVID-19 at Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute in Rome.[10] Lombardy is a densely inhabited area with a population of about 10 million. The outbreak there came to light when a 38-year-old Italian tested positive in Codogno, a comune in the province of Lodi. On 14 February, he felt unwell and went to see a doctor in Castiglione d'Adda. He was prescribed treatments for influenza.[11] On 16 February, as the man's condition worsened, he went to Codogno Hospital, reporting respiratory problems.[11] Initially there was no suspicion of COVID-19, so no additional precautionary measures were taken, and the virus was able to infect other patients and health workers.[12] Later, the patient, his pregnant wife and a friend tested positive.[11] On 20 February, three more cases were confirmed after the patients reported symptoms of pneumonia.[13] Thereafter, extensive screenings and checks were performed on everyone that had possibly been in contact with or near the infected subjects.[14] It was subsequently reported that the origin of these cases had a possible connection to the first European local transmission that occurred in Munich, Germany, on 19 January 2020.[15] Doctors in Codogno stated that the 38-year-old patient led an active social life in the weeks before his illness and potentially interacted with dozens of people before spreading the virus at their Hospital.[11][12] Afterward, he was transferred to Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia,[16] and his wife to Sacco Hospital in Milan.[17][18] On 21 February 16 more cases were confirmed \u2013 14 in Lombardy, including the doctor who prescribed treatments to the 38-year-old Codogno man,[11] and two in Veneto. On 22 February, a 77-year-old woman from Casalpusterlengo, who had pneumonia and had visited the same emergency room as the 38-year-old from Codogno, died in Lombardy.[19] Including the 78-year-old man who died in Veneto, the number of cases in Italy rose to 79.[20][21] Of the 76 newly discovered cases, 54 were found in Lombardy, including one patient in San Raffaele Hospital in Milan[22] and eight patients in Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia,[23] 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two in Lazio and one in Piedmont.[24] A secondary cluster of infections occurred in the region of Veneto, which was initially thought to be the result of a farmer being infected when visiting the primary source in Codogno.[12] The farmer was tested, and the following day, the test was confirmed negative.[25] On 21 February 2020, two people tested positive in Veneto. The next day, one of them, a 78-year-old man, died at the Schiavonia Hospital in Monselice, making him the first fatality in Italy.
