It was built in the 17th Century Colonial style with Georgian architecture and extensive gardens. The residence is not open to the public. An early Government House was burnt to the ground in 1710, when the unpopular Governor of the Leeward Islands, Colonel Daniel Parke, was killed.[1] Later Governors resided in rented homes, though Thomas Pitt (Governor 1728-1729) proposed a new permanent residence.[2] The current Government House was built in the early 1800s.[3] The stately home fell into disrepair, but a private society (along the government) raised funds to have the building restored.[when?]","Title":"Government House, Antigua and Barbuda - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3967","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Antigua_and_Barbuda"}
