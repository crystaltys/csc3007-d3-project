{"Content: ":"Dead on arrival (DOA), also dead in the field and brought in dead (BID), are terms which indicate that a patient was found to be already clinically dead upon the arrival of professional medical assistance, often in the form of first responders such as emergency medical technicians, paramedics, firefighters, or police.

Dead on arrival can also mean that a person is said by a doctor to be dead upon their arrival at a hospital, emergency room, clinic, or ward. A person can be pronounced dead on arrival if cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is found to be futile.
