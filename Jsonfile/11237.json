From 18 January 2021, people aged 75 and over who do not reside in ESMS or nursing homes can be vaccinated. This phase will last until the end of February and concerns 5 million people. From the end of February, the vaccination will be open to people aged 65 to 74. This phase concerns people who are more vulnerable than the general population. It will take place in the spring and include the following people. Phases 4 and 5 will allow vaccination to be widely opened to those over 18.
