{"Content: ":"The Frankfurt Christmas Market (in German: Frankfurter Weihnachtsmarkt[1]) is an annual outdoor Christmas market in central Frankfurt, Hessen, Germany.[2] The Christmas market opens in late November and continues until just before Christmas (normally 22 December) during Advent. It occupies a large area in central Frankfurt, including Friedrich-Stoltze-Platz, Hauptwache (to the north), Mainkai, Paulsplatz, and Römerberg (to the south).[1] The market is one of the oldest such \"Weihnachtsmärkte\" in Germany.[3] Its origins date back to 1393.[4] There are a number of affiliated markets, including in Birmingham, England.[3] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, the city of Frankfurt canceled the 2020 Christmas market planned from November 23 to December 22 on October 24, 2020.[5] The organiser, Tourismus+Congress GmbH Frankfurt am Main, made a range of digital content available as an online Christmas market on the Internet.[6]   This culture-related article is a stub.
