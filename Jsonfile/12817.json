{"Content: ":"Mount Wellington is a suburb in East Auckland, New Zealand, located 10 kilometres southeast of the city centre. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Stonefields, Tamaki, Panmure, Penrose, and Ellerslie, and by the Tamaki River. The suburb is named after the volcanic peak of Maungarei / Mount Wellington. Sylvia Park is a large business park and shopping centre located in the suburb. Maungarei / Mount Wellington is a 135-metre[3] volcanic peak of the Auckland volcanic field. It is the youngest onshore volcano of the Auckland volcanic field, having been formed by an eruption around 10,000 years ago. It is the largest of Auckland's scoria cones.[4] Prior to European settlement, the area around Maungarei was bracken scrub and not densely forested.[5] The southern section, closer to Mount Richmond, was primarily broadleaf and podocarp forest with patches of clear scrubland.[6] The isthmus south of the mountain was traditionally settled by Ngāi Tāhuhu, descendants of Tāhuhunui-o-te-rangi, captain of the Moekākara waka and namesake of Ōtāhuhu.[7][8] Four archaeological sites near Carbine Road/Panama Road near the Tamaki River were occupied in the mid to late 1500s.[8] A large number of storage pits for root vegetables (such as kūmara) were found at the sites, suggesting the area was extensively gardened by Māori, as well as an area where toki (adze) were created.[6][8] South of Mutukaroa / Hamlins Hill was Karetu, a 2 km portage between the Waitematā Harbour/Tāmaki River and the Manukau Harbour.[8] Mount Wellington covers 10.36 km2 (4.00 sq mi)[1] and had an estimated population of 27,440 as of June 2021,[2] with a population density of 2,649 people per km2. While most of the suburb is residential, Sylvia Park is almost entirely commercial, and the central area of Mount Wellington Industrial is almost entirely industrial.
