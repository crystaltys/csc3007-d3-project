Sutherland was born near Kirkwood, Missouri.[1] He lived in Missouri until the age of 25, attending St. Louis public schools and Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. He was a newspaper editor in Fulton from 1889 to 1890. In 1890 he moved to Washington, D.C. where he studied law at Columbian University (now The George Washington University) and worked for the Census office. In 1893, Sutherland moved to Elkins, West Virginia where he participated in the mining, railroad and timber businesses. In 1908, he entered politics and was elected to the West Virginia State Senate. He was a state senator until 1912 when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected in 1914 and served in the House until 1917.
