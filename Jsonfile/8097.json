{"Content: ":"Capromorelin (INN) (developmental code name CP-424,391) is an medication developed by the Pfizer drug company.[2][3] It is FDA approved for veterinary use, but remains investigational for human use. It functions to stimulate the secretion of growth hormone and as a ghrelin mimetic which causes the body to secrete human growth hormone in a way usually seen at puberty and in young adulthood. Initial studies have shown the drug to directly raise insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone levels.[4] The drug is being considered for its therapeutic value in aging adults because elderly people have much lower levels of growth hormone and less lean muscle mass, which can result in weakness and frailty.[5] In a one-year treatment trial (starting 1999) with 395 seniors between 65 and 84 years old, patients who received the drug gained an average of 3 lb (1.4 kg) in lean body mass in the first six months and also were better able to walk in a straight line in a test of balance, strength and coordination. After 12 months, patients receiving capromorelin also had an improved ability to climb stairs, however the results were not good enough to continue the trial for the 2nd planned year.[6] As of 2017, Capromorelin studies in humans had been discontinued.[7][8] In October of 2020, capromorelin was FDA approved, under the brand name Elura for use in cats with chronic kidney disease. It is also marketed under the brand name Entyce for use in dogs.[9][10]","Title":"Capromorelin - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8097","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capromorelin"}
