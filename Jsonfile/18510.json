After playing college football at Pacific University and being drafted by the National Football League without playing a down, Funston became a wide receiver for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers from 1959 to 1966.[1][2] For all those years, Ken Ploen was his quarterback. Together, they were major factors in Winnipeg's four Grey Cup appearances (1959, 1961, 1962, 1965), including three victories: 1959, 1961, 1962, and one loss: 1965. His highest totals as a receiver were the two years he was voted as a western conference all-star: 1961 (47 catches for 892 yards, 19.0 yards per catch, 8 touchdowns) and 1963 (60 catches for 835 yards, 13.9 yards per catch, 9 touchdowns).
