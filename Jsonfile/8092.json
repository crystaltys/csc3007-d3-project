{"Content: ":"Relamorelin (INN, USAN) (developmental code names RM-131, BIM-28131, BIM-28163) is a synthetic peptide, centrally penetrant, selective agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) which is under development by Allergan pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis, chronic idiopathic constipation, and anorexia nervosa.[1][2][3] It is a pentapeptide and an analogue of ghrelin with improved potency and pharmacokinetics.[1][2] In humans, relamorelin produces increases in plasma growth hormone, prolactin, and cortisol levels,[2][4] and, like other GHSR agonists, increases appetite.[3] As of June 2015, relamorelin is in phase II clinical trials for diabetic gastroparesis and constipation.[5] The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis.[6] This hormonal preparation article is a stub.
