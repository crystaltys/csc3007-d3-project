{"Content: ":"In historical linguistics, cognates, also called lexical cognates, are sets of words in different languages that have been inherited in direct descent from an etymological ancestor in a common parent language.[1] Because language change can have very radical effects on both the sound and the meaning of a word, cognates may not be obvious, and often it takes rigorous study of historical sources and the application of the comparative method to establish whether lexemes are cognate or not. The term cognate derives from the Latin noun cognatus, which means \"blood relative\".[2] Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which may have changed as the languages developed separately. For example English starve and Dutch sterven or German sterben (\"to die\") all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, *sterbaną (\"die\"). Also, cognates do not need to have similar forms: English father, French père, and Armenian հայր (hayr) all descend directly from Proto-Indo-European *ph\u2082tḗr. An extreme case is Armenian երկու (erku) and English two, which descend from Proto-Indo-European *dwóh\u2081 (note that the sound change *dw > erk in Armenian is regular). An example of cognates in Indo-European languages are the words night (English), nicht (Scots), Nacht (German), nacht (Dutch, Frisian), nag (Afrikaans), Naach (Colognian), natt (Swedish, Norwegian), nat (Danish), nátt (Faroese), nótt (Icelandic), noc (Czech, Slovak, Polish), ночь, noch (Russian), ноќ, noć (Macedonian), нощ, nosht (Bulgarian), nishi (Bengali), ніч, nich (Ukrainian), ноч, noch/noč (Belarusian), noč (Slovene), noć (Serbo-Croatian), nakts (Latvian), naktis (Lithuanian), νύξ, nyx (Ancient Greek), νύχτα / nychta (Modern Greek), nakt- (Sanskrit), natë (Albanian), nos (Welsh, Cornish), noz (Breton), nox/nocte (Latin), nuit (French), noche (Spanish), nueche (Asturian), noite (Portuguese and Galician), notte (Italian), nit (Catalan), nuet/nit/nueit (Aragonese), nuèch / nuèit (Occitan) and noapte (Romanian), all meaning \"night\" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European *nókʷts \"night\". The Indo-European languages have many hundreds of such sets of cognates, though not all are as neat as the cognates of night. The Arabic سلام salām, the Hebrew שלום\u200e shalom, the Assyrian Neo-Aramaic shlama and the Amharic selam (\"peace\") are also cognates, derived from the Proto-Semitic *šalām- \"peace\". Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word milk is clearly a cognate of German Milch, Dutch and Afrikaans melk, Russian молоко (moloko), Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian mleko/mlijeko.[3] On the other hand, French lait, Catalan llet, Italian latte, Romanian lapte, Spanish leche and leite (Portuguese and Galician) (all meaning \"milk\") are less-obvious cognates of Ancient Greek γάλακτος gálaktos (genitive singular of γάλα gála, \"milk\"), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin lac \"milk\" as well as the English word lactic and other terms borrowed from Latin. Some cognates are semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word חוצפה\u200e chutzpah means \"impudence\", its Classical Arabic cognate حصافة ḥaṣāfah means \"sound judgment.\"[4] False cognates are words that are believed to have a common origin, but which in fact do not. For example, Latin habēre and German haben both mean 'to have' and are phonetically similar. However, the words evolved from different Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots: haben, like English have, comes from PIE *kh\u2082pyé- 'to grasp', and has the Latin cognate capere 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Habēre, on the other hand, is from PIE *gʰabʰ 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English give and German geben.[5] Likewise, English much and Spanish mucho look similar and have a similar meaning, but are not cognates: much is from Proto-Germanic *mikilaz < PIE *meǵ- and mucho is from Latin multum < PIE *mel-; a true cognate is Spanish maño 'big' (archaic).[6] Cognates are distinguished from other kinds of relationships.","Title":"Cognate - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1206","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"}
