Every year there, as well as in the village of Sortobe, the holiday \u201cDay of the Dungan Ethnos\u201d is held.[9] With the support of the Dungan Association of Kazakhstan (ADK), a monument dedicated to Bai Yanhu was unveiled in the village in 2001.[10] The conflict began in the village of Sortobe because of the incident with the fight between the elderly Dungan Ersmane Yunhu and his son Marat Yunhu with the aqsaqal Tölegen Qūdaşpaev and his two sons. 80 year old Tölegen was beaten and the Qūdaşpaev family of three people were heading to the hospital until their road was blocked by a Dungan driver driving from the yard onto the highway. This resulted in a scuffle taking place, which lead to the hospitalization of two members of the Qūdaşpaev family. Tölegen was later taken by sanitary aviation to Almaty for a surgery on the hip joint.[11] At approximately around 14:15 in Sortobe, near the village of Masanchi, a passenger car was stopped by the patrolmen due to non-compliance with the license plate standard. When checking documents, other administrative offenses were also found out.[12] While in the process, the driver tried to flee, but was overtaken in the courtyard of his home where the policemen were completely attacked.[12] According to unofficial data, the cause of the conflict was a domestic conflict between residents of several villages.[13] On 9 February, information appeared that the cause of the riots was the distribution of video material on social networks and messengers which were filmed on 5 February due to a conflict between two drivers on the road.[14][15] The police department of the Jambyl Region sent out a press release with a refutation after messages began to spread on social media that an interethnic conflict broke out in two villages of Sortobe and Masanchi.[16] According to unofficial data, the public outrage then spread to the villages of Bulan Batyr and Aukhatty.[17] On the same day, in the evening at Masanchi, a mass brawl broke out between 70 people, which eventually to a number of 300 when provocateurs and eyewitnesses to the conflict began to film what was happening and called upon others to participate through SMS messages and social media.[18][19][20] Additional forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were sent to Korday.[20] In the early morning of 8 February, the National Guard troops were brought in from Almaty.[13] Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on 8 February 2020 made an address to the public, stating that the provocateurs had taken advantage of the situation.[21] Information and Social Development Minister Dauren Abaev, commenting on the events, saying that it was a domestic conflict.[22] Deputy Prosecutor General Bolat Dembaev made a statement about the situation in two villages, urging the public to remain calm and not to succumb to provocations.[23] Eight deaths were reported that day.[18] Almaty markets \"İalian\", \"Baisat\" and \"Alatau\" where Dungans worked in the Northern Ring area were closed that day.

As a result of the conflict, the authorities announced that 11 people were killed, 192 were injured, including 19 police officers; 168 homes were damaged and burned, and 122 vehicles were damaged.[24] Nearly 8,000 Dungans temporarily fled their homes.

Mostly women and children crossed the border.[25] The press service of the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health reported that in Tokmok, a city bordering Kazakhstan, 17 citizens of Kazakhstan and 1 citizen of Kyrgyzstan whom were injured during the pogroms applied for medical help, 10 of them (all citizens of Kazakhstan) were hospitalized (8 people in the traumatology department Tokmok city hospital, and 2 people to the eye microsurgery department of the National Hospital in Bishkek).[26] Kazakh officials on 8 February denied reports of a mass exodus of the population from Korday to neighboring Kyrgyzstan, then the following day on 9 February, it was officially recognized that 12,000 residents of the Korday had left Kazakhstan. They were urged to return to the country as soon as possible by the Kazakh border guards.
