{"Content: ":"Sporting Club JuveCaserta (sometimes spelled Juve Caserta), also known as Dec√≤ Caserta after its title sponsor, is an Italian professional basketball team based in Caserta, Campania. The team currently plays in the Serie A2, the second tier of Italian basketball. For past club sponsorship names, see sponsorship names. JuveCaserta was founded by a group of local enthusiasts in 1951.[1] The name Sporting Club Juventus was chosen by Santino Piccolo, a fan of the homonymous Turin football team. The team started playing on the clay courts of the Liceo Classico Pietro Giannone. The side played in the 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387 finals of the first division Serie A before finally winning the competition in 1990\u201391, the first team from the south of Italy to do so. They had earlier won the Italian Cup in 1988 and reached the European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1989. Following the 1997\u201398 season, the club went bankrupt. In 2004, two lower-level Caserta-based teams merged under the name of JuveCaserta. That side returned to the Serie A in 2008 after winning the LegaDue promotion playoffs. Finishing in second-place in the league during the 2009\u201310 season, Caserta reached the playoff semi-finals but lost the series against Armani Jeans Milano 2-3. The next season saw the side lose in the EuroLeague first qualifying round to Russian team Khimki, playing instead in the Eurocup where they reached the quarterfinals where they narrowly lost to UNICS. In July 2017, Juvecaserta Basket was excluded by CONI from the 2017\u201318 LBA season, due to financial issues.[2] Vanoli Cremona was reprieved and took the place of Juvecaserta.[3] In the 2017\u201318 season, the team would play in the Serie D, the fifth tier.
