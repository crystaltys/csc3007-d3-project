Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on March 10. Mayor Marty Walsh declared a public health emergency on March 15.[4] By March 21, more than a hundred people in Boston had tested positive for COVID-19. Most early cases were traceable to a company meeting held in late February by the biotechnology firm Biogen in Boston. In May, Boston was first in Massachusetts for overall number of cases and eighteenth for cases per capita citywide.[5] New cases per day peaked on April 24, 2020, at 659, and began to decline after.[6][7] As of October 14, 2020[update], Boston has the highest number of cases in Massachusetts and the 38th-highest number of cases per capita.[8] As of March 8, 2021[update], there were 59,953 cumulative cases and 1,286 deaths due to COVID-19 in Boston. 11.4% of cases required hospitalization, 2.7% of cases resulted in death, and 84.6% of cases have recovered.[note 1] 9.8% of cases were healthcare workers,[note 1] and 46% of deaths were in long-term care facilities.[3] As of October 12[update], Boston had completed 308,851 molecular tests, 4.5% of which came back positive in the preceding week.

The individual, a male in his 20s, had recently returned from Wuhan, China and began experiencing symptoms. He sought medical care but did not require hospitalization, and was therefore able to self-isolate and recover at home.[1][4] 175 executives of Biogen, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, held a two-day leadership conference from February 26\u201328 at the Boston Marriott Long Wharf hotel.[9] On February 29, a Biogen executive began to develop symptoms and sought treatment at a Boston area hospital. Suspecting COVID-19 was the cause of the illness, the executive requested a test, but was told by hospital staff that it was not necessary.[9][10][11] On March 4, staff from Biogen contacted the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to report two executives who had attended the February employee meeting had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon returning home from Europe.

When restrictions were originally announced in mid-March, they were to end at noon on April 7; later their projected end date was pushed to May 4. Baker said it was unlikely restrictions would be lifted by then because the surge of cases had hit later than expected \u2013 May 4 presumed a surge in early April. Baker said the process of reopening will begin when hospitalizations start to decline consistently, and when there is \"some evidence that we are in fact over the hump ... with respect to the surge.\"[25] On April 27, Boston Public Health Commission extended the public health emergency declaration until further notice.[4] On April 28, Governor Baker extended the stay-at-home advisory and non-essential business closure to May 18.

Governor Baker advised residents to still keep precautions as the virus was still not eradicated.[44] Although Governor Baker was still looking at the data in the state, he announced his plan for Phase 3 of reopening in the state on June 30. Phase 3 was to allow museums, fitness centers, moderate-size movie theaters, overnight youth camps, sports for all ages, and indoor recreational facilities to open with restrictions remaining in place. Governor Baker announced that Massachusetts may move into Phase 3 as early as July 6.[46] On July 2, the state confirmed that Step 1 of Phase 3 of reopening was allowed to start on July 6, in all of Massachusetts except for Boston, which was to start Phase 3 one week later, on July 13.[48] On July 13, the City of Boston decided to include the casino Encore Boston Harbor for reopening during Phase 3, with temperature screening upon entry and masks being mandatory.[50] On August 7, Massachusetts Governor Baker took steps to slow and pause reopening in the state. He reduced the outdoor gathering limit from 100 to 50 people, started requiring masks at private gatherings of 10 or more people from different households, authorized state police to start issuing fines to event hosts, and created the COVID Enforcement and Intervention Team for operations in high-risk communities. The state was to postpone Step 2 of Phase 3 of reopening indefinitely, which would have allowed higher-contact sports and small theater and music venues to operate indoors. To prevent \"bars masquerading as restaurants\" he required that alcoholic beverages be accompanied by food in restaurants.[56] On September 29, Governor Baker announced that communities in the state classified by the state as \"lower risk\" would be allowed to move into Step 2 of Phase 3 of the state's reopening plan beginning on October 5. This step was to include allowing both indoor and outdoor performance venues to open at 50% capacity (up to 250 people); fitting rooms to open in retail stores; and gyms, museums, libraries, and driving and flight schools to increase capacity to 50%.[64] At the time, Boston had been considered a \"red zone\" community, meaning they were to remain at Step 1 of Phase 3 of reopening. Mayor Walsh warned the public in late September that Boston was approaching red zone in terms of COVID-19. Not long after, the state classified Boston as a red zone community.[65] On May 28, Mayor Walsh announced a new \"healthy streets\" program to promote social distancing in the roads of Boston. The buses and MBTA trains would not accept as many passengers. Many bus and train stops would relocate or close down altogether. Mayor Walsh announced that bike lanes would be built fast, to allow social distancing for bikes. The city would also be supporting small businesses in Boston. The city will help move some restaurants outdoors, to further allow social distancing. This would be implemented with transportation barriers, to allow more space.[34] On May 29, the Mayor Walsh released a \"return to workplace framework\" to safely reopen businesses and workplaces. Social distancing of 6 feet was to be enforced. Workplaces were to reduce capacity to 25% of their original capacity before COVID-19. All workplaces were required to ensure access to handwashing facilities on site, including soap and running water. Workplaces were to avoid sharing office materials. Cleaning and disinfecting frequently were to be enforced in all workplaces and businesses in Boston. In businesses, customers were to social distance inside the business as well as outside. Masks were to be required from all employees and customers, in all workplaces and businesses in Boston.[35] Panic buying, especially since March 11, led to shortages of some products, as well as causing crowds at grocery stores as early in the day as 7:00 a.m.[77] Pandemic supplies like sanitizing supplies and masks remained difficult to get for weeks. Grocery retailers, as required by state law, offered older and more vulnerable people a time in the early morning when they could shop separately.[78] Later, emergency orders required grocery stores to implement stricter measures, including limiting the number of people allowed inside stores at a time, and marking queues to maintain social distancing.[79] They installed plastic guards to reduce contact between customers and cashiers, and designated some aisles one-way. By the end of May, grocery stores started expanding hours, with toilet paper back on shelves, but home baking supplies like yeast and flour in low quantity. The Greater Boston Food Bank said that it experienced double the normal demand for food, distributing more food per month than it ever had before. It also said that because food donations from restaurants and grocery stores plummeted, it was spending about 50 times as much money to buy food, though the Massachusetts government provided cash assistance, and the federal government provided surplus food purchased from farmers (the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program).[80] School closures began in early March, when Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced on March 9 that it was moving to online-only classes for the remainder of the spring semester.[81] Northeastern University, which had already closed their satellite campuses in San Francisco and Seattle, hesitated to close their main campus for fear of international students losing their F visa status. On March 6 the university publicly called on the Department of Homeland Security to grant clemency for international students so the university could close.[82] On March 10, Harvard University announced that its classes would be online-only for the rest of the spring semester.[83][84][85] The University of Massachusetts Boston informed faculty that they should prepare to teach remotely.[86] On March 11, Northeastern University and Boston University moved all classes online.[87][88] On March 14, Northeastern University informed students they would need to vacate their dormitories by 5:00 p.m. on March 17.[89][90] Up to this point students were taking online classes but allowed to remain on university property.[91] Boston College moved all classes online, and all students were told to vacate their dorms by March 15.[92] On March 13, Boston Mayor Walsh announced that Boston Public Schools would be closed starting on March 17 until April 27.[4] On March 15, Governor Baker ordered all schools in Massachusetts closed for three weeks from March 17 through April 7.[4] On March 25, he extended the closing through May 4.[93] On April 21, he extended it to the remainder of the school year.[94] On August 1, Mayor Walsh announced that Boston Public Schools would not return to 100% in-person learning even if in-class learning would resume in the fall. He stated that students would participate in a hybrid of in-school and remote learning. He also gave parents the option to have their children learn 100% remotely.[55] On August 21, Mayor Walsh announced that Boston Public Schools would begin the school year 100% remotely before transitioning into a hybrid model. \"On September 21st \u2014 one month from today \u2014 all students will begin with remote learning,\" he said. \"The first students will not return to our classrooms until October 1st.\" The BPS superintendent and Mayor Walsh formed a 4-phase return to a hybrid model. On October 1, the students with the highest needs were to return. On October 15 and 19, K0, K1, and K2 students were to return. On October 22 and 26, grades 1\u20133 were to go back to the classroom. On November 5 and 9, grades 4\u20138 were to return to the classroom. On November 16 and 19, grades 9\u201312 were to return.[59] On October 7, Boston delayed the next phase of in-person learning to October 22 in Boston Public Schools, in response to an uptick in cases. The positive test rate in the city had increased to 4.1%, prompting city officials to put a pause on moving forward with in-person learning. High-needs students were to continue in-person learning. Both Boston officials and the Boston Teachers Union agreed with this decision. They plan to keep the remainder of the phases the same, over the course of October and November.[67] On October 16, in-person learning was further delayed to October 29.[70] Some colleges in Boston began moving students in to dorms in mid-August. By late-August, students were beginning to move in to on-campus housing at Boston University in Boston.[95] On September 10, Governor Baker said he \"couldn't imagine a reason\" to not go back to in-person or hybrid learning in the state's green and white communities in terms of spread in COVID-19. However, he has been encouraging communities in the yellow and red zones to stick with remote learning. He noted that not all cities and towns were following that guidance. Communities in the red zone, such as Chatham, had begun or were planning to resume in-person learning. Governor Baker instructed the town to continue remote learning.[60] By mid-September, Boston College began seeing a significant spike in COVID-19 cases. About a dozen cases in August had turned into an outbreak in the swimming teams at the college. Mayor Walsh said this outbreak is a \"serious matter\" and that he had been communicating with state officials. Also, Boston officials asked BC to begin contact tracing. The college was reported to have agreed.[62] Several leagues began postponing or suspending their sports seasons starting March 12, and Major League Baseball canceled the remainder of spring training. On March 16, after the CDC recommended restricting events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, the major league baseball season was postponed indefinitely.[96] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days.[97] The National Hockey League season was suspended indefinitely.[98] Boston Celtics player Marcus Smart announced on March 18 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, having been tested five days prior.[99] In college sports, the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled all winter and spring tournaments, most notably the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, affecting colleges and universities statewide.[100] The Boston Athletic Association canceled the 2020 Boston Marathon on May 28. In March they had postponed the race, which usually takes place in April, until September. However, Boston Mayor Walsh said on May 28, \"There's no way to hold this usual race format without bringing large numbers of people into close proximity. While our goal and our hope was to make progress in containing the virus and recovering our economy, this kind of event would not be responsible or realistic on September 14 or any time this year.\" 2020 was the first year in the race's 124-year history that the event was postponed or canceled. Runners will still be able to participate \"virtually\" in September, and will receive a medal and other items if they send proof that they complete the race in under six hours. Those who qualified for the 2020 marathon will be eligible to compete in the 2021 race.[33] On June 12, the Boston Bruins team announced that one of their players had tested positive for COVID-19. Phase 2 of the reopening plan required all Bruins players to be tested before using any team facilities. The team was told that the player, whose identity remains confidential, was asymptomatic so far.[101] On July 21, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association's Board of Directors voted to delay the start of the fall sports season until September 14. This decision was made in compliance with state guidelines for K-12 sports in the state.[52] On October 8, Boston College announced that they were cancelling 5 field hockey games after a player contracted the virus. This prompted all other team players to go through a process of contact tracing. Once done, they were ordered to quarantine for 14 days.[102] On October 11, a New England Patriots facility was shut down after a player tested positive for the virus. The team was supposed to play Denver on Monday, but the game was postponed. ESPN reported that this was the team's fourth case within 8 days.[103] The sudden surge of cases in Boston during the week of March 9 led many organizations to ask employees to work from home, and prompted museums and libraries to close. This led to a noticeable decline in Boston's rush hour traffic; in some cases, drive times for major highways dropped by 30 to 50 percent.[104] Following the beginning of reopening Massachusetts on May 18, the Greater Boston Area began to see the return of severe traffic congestion during rush hour, especially seen on the Southeast Expressway.[105] Concerns were raised with the MBTA's response to coronavirus, with worsening traffic congestion.[106] 14 miles of bus lanes was added for MBTA buses in late 2020, with the statement that the pandemic has helped move things along.[107] The possibility of significant, permanent, service cuts and fare hikes on the MBTA was raised, with a significant shortfall of revenue due to COVID-19 and uncertainty of state and federal relief, and its impact on low income riders and rush hour traffic. A need to look at route by route and surveying employers would be used in determining service changes after COVID-19.[108] In October, various proposals of service cuts across the transit system was presented to the agency's governing board, which public transit advocates warned of devastation.[109] Various proposals included ending subway and commuter rail service earlier in the evening at 9pm, closure of various stations, and elimination of midday and weekend transit service. These service cuts would affect two thirds of bus service, all rail service, and ferries. The changes would go into effect in spring 2021. The data in these charts are recorded by the date the test result was recorded, not the day the test was administered. This may result in backlog in the charts on a few days.
