{"Content: ":"Inconclusive Sudan SRF Sudanese Armed Forces SLA SPLM-N 600\u2013650 killed 179 confirmed captured 405 vehicles destroyed 746 vehicles captured[12][better source needed] The Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile is an armed conflict in the Sudanese southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile between the Sudanese Army (SAF) and Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), a northern affiliate of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) in South Sudan. After some years of relative calm following the 2005 agreement which ended the second Sudanese civil war between the Sudanese government and SPLM rebels, fighting broke out again in the lead-up to South Sudan independence on 9 July 2011, starting in South Kordofan on 5 June and spreading to the neighboring Blue Nile state in September. SPLM-N, splitting from newly independent SPLM, took up arms against the inclusion of the two southern states in Sudan with no popular consultation and against the lack of democratic elections.[17] The conflict is intertwined with the War in Darfur, since in November 2011 SPLM-N established a loose alliance with Darfuri rebels, called Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF).[18] As of October 2014, some two million people have been affected by the conflict, with more than 500,000 having been displaced and about 250,000 of them fleeing to South Sudan and Ethiopia.[19][20] In January 2015, fighting intensified as Omar al-Bashir's government tried to regain control of rebel-held territory ahead of April 2015 general elections.[21][22] With the overthrow of al-Bashir in April 2019 following months of protests, the SRF announced a three-month ceasefire, hoping to facilitate a Sudanese transition to democracy.[23] This led to the beginning of peace negotiations between the rebels and the new interim government. The Sudanese peace process was formalised with the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the Sudanese Revolution, that mandates that a peace agreement be made in South Kordofan and Blue Nile (and in Darfur) within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government.[24][25] On 31 August 2020, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed in Juba, South Sudan, between the Sudan's transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Abdul Wahid al Nur refused to sign the agreement.[26] An agreement was reached between the transitional government and the SPLM-North al-Hilu rebel faction on 3 September 2020 in Addis Ababa to separate religion and state and not discriminate against anyone's ethnicity in order to secure the equal treatment of all citizens of Sudan. The declaration of principles stated that \u201cSudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.\u201d[27] Although South Kordofan and Blue Nile are north of the international border separating Sudan and South Sudan, many of their residents (particularly in the Nuba Mountains) identify with the South. Many residents fought on the side of southern rebels during the long civil war.[28] South Kordofan and Blue Nile were not allowed to participate in the January 2011 referendum to create South Sudan, and the \"popular consultation\" process they were promised also failed to take place.[29] According to satellite imagery, during early Spring 2011, Sudan elevated dirt roads needed for tank transportation in the areas they are not traditionally elevated,[30][31] and in March 2011 it started deploying police and military installations in the area.[32] In May 2011, ahead of South Sudan's scheduled independence, tensions rose around the status of the Abyei Area, an oil-rich region that was statutorily part of both South Kordofan and Northern Bahr el Ghazal states. As South Kordofan was slated to remain with the North while Northern Bahr el Ghazal was seceding together with the rest of what was then Southern Sudan Autonomous Region, the status of Abyei was unclear, and both Khartoum and Juba claimed the area as their own. On 19 May 2011, militants reportedly affiliated with the Sudan People's Liberation Army attacked a convoy of mixed Sudanese Army and UNMIS vehicles 10 km north of Abyei town as they withdrew from the area's administrative centre,[33] drawing sharp condemnation from both the Sudanese government and the United Nations.[34] At least 15 Sudanese tanks entered Abyei town on 20 May, beginning large-scale fighting in Abyei. By 22 May, the Sudanese military had seized control of the town, and most of Abyei's residents had fled south toward Bahr el Ghazal. Both the Sudanese government and the government of Southern Sudan accused one another of violating the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.[35] In June 2011, an African Union panel headed by former South African president Thabo Mbeki tried to de-escalate the situation through north\u2013south talks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.[36] On 20 June, the parties agreed to demilitarize the contested area of Abyei, and UN peacekeepers were deployed as part of United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei on 27 June.[37] The agreement details the mechanism by which the Abyei administration council to replace the one dissolved by president Omer Hassan al-Bashir in May 2011. Its chief shall be picked by the SPLM but must be approved by the Northern National Congress Party (NCP). The deputy however, would be nominated by the NCP and endorsed by SPLM. Three of the five heads of the departments of the administrative council would be nominated by the SPLM and the remaining two by the NCP. A police service would be established for the region, with the size and composition determined by a joint committee co-chaired by northern and southern officials. The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon welcomed the accord but said the real test would be how both sides would implement the deal.[38] On 21 June, a statement was attributed to the NCP's official in charge of Abyei file, Didiri Mohamed Ahmed, as saying that there was an understanding reached at the Addis Ababa meeting between the two parties that South Sudan would concede future ownership of Abyei to the North. However, the spokesman of SPLA, Philip Aguer, told the press that the statement from the NCP senior official was incorrect.[39] On 5 June 2011, armed conflict broke out between the government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement (northern sector) in broader South Kordofan state, ahead of the scheduled independence of the South on 9 July.[40][41] The Northern army said that SPLA launched an attack on a police station and stole weapons prompting a response. The SPLA claimed that the Northern army attempted to disarm their units by force.[36] That day JEM rebels claimed to have destroyed an army camp in the area of Jama, South Kordofan, killing 38 soldiers and wounding other 27.[42] On 14 June, the UN accused the Sudanese government of carrying out an \"intensive bombing campaign\" near the north\u2013south border which has led to \"huge suffering\" for civilians in South Kordofan. Some 140,000 people have fled the fighting. Aid agency offices have been looted, churches have been ransacked and buildings destroyed. Aid workers say that ethnic Nubans are being targeted by the northern military and Arab militias. This was denied by Rabbie Abdelattif Ebaid, an adviser to Sudan's information minister, who said that only rebel fighters were being targeted.[28] On 15 June, US President Barack Obama called for a ceasefire urging both the North and South to \"live up to their responsibilities\" to prevent a return to civil war. The head of the worldwide Anglican church, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said: \"The humanitarian challenge is already great, and the risk of another Darfur situation, with civilian populations at the mercy of government-supported terror, is a real one\".[41] On 19 June, Sudanese president Omer Hassan al-Bashir accused the SPLM-N of \"betrayal\" in South Kordofan. \"If they want war...we will show them practically like what happened in Abyei and South Kordofan\" Bashir said. \"It is better that they [SPLM-N] come to us in good terms and we will be better than them,\" he added. The Northern Army said that it would continue its military campaign in South Kordofan, which included aerial bombardment, until it crushes the rebellion led by former deputy governor and leading SPLM-N figure Abdelaziz al-Hilu. Fighting intensified around the state capital of Kadugli.[36] On 6 July JEM field commander announced that his forces were able to defeat an army battalion in a field near Heglieg, comprising fifty four members, arranged a trap for the army battalion, which was composed of nine Land Cruiser cars. The head of the battalion was killed, along with two other soldiers.[43] On 11 July, clashes were reported in Fula, South Kordofan. Sudanese Federal National Front claimed that their forces killed 20 government troops, and destroyed four of the seven Landcruisers, that carried the government troops. Their spokesman said that they also seized fire arms and ammunition. The remainder of the government troops fled.[44] Fighting continued after South Sudan gained independence on 9 July, though the Sudanese government insisted that order had been restored in South Kordofan proper. A UN report leaked on 18 July documented alleged war crimes in South Kordofan, blaming both sides but reserving many of its heaviest accusations for the Sudanese government. The following day, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos called for an independent investigation into atrocities possibly committed during the conflict. Amos said the government of Sudan should lift its restrictions on access to the region.[45] The alleged human rights abuses include \"forced disappearances, targeting of UN staff and summary executions.\"[46] Joint SPLM-N and JEM forces defeated government forces from 10 to 17 July in the Nuba Mountains. An army garrison in Al-Tais was captured by rebels. By the end, 150 government soldiers and 1 rebel were killed, considerable numbers of weaponry including light and heavy machine guns and artilleries, RBJ, AK47 and anti air craft missiles were captured by rebels. Also 3 rebels were captured.[47] However, a JEM leader among the militants captured was later sentenced to death by hanging, state-run media reported on 27 August.[48] Around the same time, the Sudan Tribune reported that the SPLM-N, the JEM, and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) had formed a tentative alliance to resist the federal government in Khartoum.[49] On 1 September, SPLM-N rebels in South Kordofan claimed the military was deliberately destroying crops and farms belonging to the Nuba people in an attempt to starve the state into submission.[50] Meanwhile, state-run media claimed SPLM-N guerrillas killed 17 civilians, including children, and wounded 14 in the Kalugi region of South Kordofan the same day.[51] On 7 September, clashes between Abdel Wahid's Sudan Liberation Army and Sudanese army were reported in Jebel Marra, rebels claimed to have killed 40 government soldiers and captured six of their vehicles. Three rebels were killed and another four were wounded.[52] A spokesman for the Sudanese military said that SPLM-N militants attacked army positions in Ad-Damazin, the capital of Blue Nile state, late on 1 September. Governor Malik Agar disputed this account, saying the army attacked Blue Nile state institutions first, including his official residence.[53] The military quickly took control of Ad-Damazin, and Khartoum sacked Agar and replaced him with a military governor. Agar and his allies regrouped in southern Blue Nile. On 2 September, the federal government declared a state of emergency in the state. The Sudanese Air Force reportedly carried out strike missions, bombing SPLM-N villages and towns.[54] The SPLM-N claimed four civilians were killed in an aerial bombing of Kormok.[55] By 22 September, the SPLM-N claimed victory in several battlefields (in the areas of Ibri, locality of Dlami; Angrto, locality of Talodi and Abolhassan, in the locality of Cdarno) killing 25 soldiers and militias belonging to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and captured several soldiers and weapons. Some degree of notoriety was accorded to the SPLM-N's use of Rick Derringer's \"Rock 'n' Roll Hoochie Koo\" as something of a battle anthem during the 2011 violence.[56] The SPLM-N's Darfuri allies, the JEM and the SLM, issued a joint statement on 4 September condemning the Sudanese military's use of force against the SPLM-N in Blue Nile, calling it a plot to spread \"chaos and killing\" across the country. They also called on the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Blue Nile, Darfur, and South Kordofan.[57] The Sudanese military claimed on 10 September to have broken an SPLM-N \"siege\" of Qiessan, near the Ethiopian border, and evacuated its wounded from the town, though it was unclear whether they took control of Qiessan outright or just escaped from the area. Both Agar and Yahia Mohamed Kheir, the military governor appointed by Bashir, claimed control of 80 percent of Blue Nile state. Meanwhile, the Sudanese government said 5,000 people had fled their homes in Blue Nile as a result of the fighting, and Information Minister Sana Hamad al-Awad claimed it had proof the South Sudanese government was paying the salaries of SPLM-N fighters across the border.[58] By 3 October, SPLM-N forces clashed with Sudanese army in South Kordofan killing 47 army members, including three well-known militia leaders and conjuring 23 more.[59] On 9 October, SPLM-N rebels ambushed government soldiers in Khor Adrak in Blue Nile, killing 30 of them and destroying three army vehicles and capturing another one.[60] The Sudanese military seized control of Kurmuk, the former stronghold of the SPLM-N in Blue Nile state, on 2 November. President Omar al-Bashir visited the town four days later to declare it \"liberated\". He also threatened South Sudan with war, accusing it of supporting the SPLM-N in its anti-government activities.[61][62] On 10 November, it was reported that the Sudanese government bombed Yida camp in South Sudan's Unity state soon after 12:00 GMT the same day. Two Antonov makeshift bombers were seen leaving the area. They were said to have dropped five bombs, four detonating. The local official Miabek Lang said at least 12 people had been killed and 20 wounded during the strike. The Sudanese government has denied the claims.[63] Darfuri factions and the SPLM-N in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states announced the formation of an alliance called the Sudanese Revolutionary Front on 12 November.

The Sudan People's Liberation Movement however strongly denied this happening, and asserted in return that it had destroyed a whole unit of militias affiliated to the National Congress Party and its armed forces near the city Toroj, killing 60 of the Sudanese army and militia and destroying 3 armored vehicles.

Army spokesman Ahmed Khalifa al-Shami stated that the ceasefire was intended \"to give the armed groups a chance to join the peace process and to surrender their arms.[246] The ceasefire was later extended in October to the end of the year [247] and then on December 31, it was extended again by a whole month [248] On January 16, 2017, Omar Al-Bashir extended the ceasefire by 6 months [247] On February 21, 2017, Sudan attacked SPLM-N positions in the area of the town of Kadugli, violating the ceasefire.[249] On 11 April 2019, amid weeks of demonstrations and ongoing protests in the capital of Khartoum, Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir was removed from power in a coup d'état by the Sudanese Armed Forces after nearly 30 years in office.[250] Vice president and defense minister Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf dissolved the government of al-Bashir and formed a military council to run the country.[251] On 17 April 2019, SPLM-N announced a suspension of hostilities in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state.[252] The leader of SPLM-N, Abdulaziz al-Hilu, said in a statement released by the armed group, \u201cAs a goodwill gesture \u2026 to give a chance for an immediate transfer of power to civilians, I, commander of SPLM-N announce the suspending of hostilities for three months in all areas under its control until July 31, 2019.\u201d[253] Two weeks after the ouster of Sudan's Omar Al Bashir, Uganda's foreign minister Okello Oryem, has announced that his country may offer Bashir refuge.[23] On 31 August 2020, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed in Juba, South Sudan, between the Sudan's transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), except for Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM\u2013N) led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM) led by Abdul Wahid al Nur.[26] An agreement was reached between the transitional government and the SPLM-North al-Hilu rebel faction on 3 September 2020 in Addis Ababa to separate religion and state and not discriminate against anyone's ethnicity in order to secure the equal treatment of all citizens of Sudan. The declaration of principles stated that 'Sudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.'[27] On 3 October 2020, another peace deal was signed by the SRF, SPLM\u2013N led by Malik Agar, SLM led by Minni Minnawi and the Sudanese government,[254] with the absence of both al Nur and al-Hilu.[255] On 28 March 2021, Al-Hilu signed a peace agreement with the Sudanese government in Juba, South Sudan, to establish of a civil, democratic federal state, which would guarantee freedom of religion and have a single army to protect national security.[256] Al-Nur continued to refuse to attend any peace negotiations with the government.[257] Sometime during March an undated video emerged of the Governor of South Kordofan Ahmed Haroun telling Sudanese soldiers: \"You must hand over the place clean. Rub it, crush it and sweep it. Don't bring them [Rebels] back alive. We have no space for them\". An army commander standing near Haroun then says: \"Don't bring them back, eat them alive\" amid laughter by the group in the video. Haroun follows with \"Don't create an administrative burden for us [by bringing back prisoners alive]\".[258][259] The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the comments by the Governor could amount to \"violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states\". She followed with \"Such comments are extremely worrying in this context and could amount to incitement.\".[260] The Sudanese Government has since claimed that Mr. Haroun, who has already been indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his alleged role in the previous conflict in Darfur,[261] was simply trying to boost the soldiers' morale. Mr Haron however, has called the video a fabrication, accusing al-Jazeera of editing the video to distort what he had said and vowed to sue the news channel.[262] Ms. Pillay said that witnesses who have visited the Nuba mountain region, mainly inhabited by the Nuba people and located in Southern Kordofan, have been reporting the burning of villages and killing of civilians in \"an apparent scorched-earth policy.\" \"We know very little about the scale of the military operation in Southern Kordofan, as we have been denied access to the area,\" she said. \"But as far back as August last year, we found that human rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes have taken place in Southern Kordofan.\".[263] Following what Yasir Arman, leader of SPLA-N[264] and the UN[260] have described as a \"scorched earth policy\" more than 105,000 Sudanese refugees from the states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile have sought refuge in South Sudan. An additional 30,000 refugees fled Blue Nile into nearby Ethiopia.[265] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partners started providing basic assistance to more than 16,000 refugees who settled in Yida, South Sudan, after fleeing violence in the Nuba Mountains region, located in Sudan's Southern Kordofan state.[266] Another 2,300 refugees have so far moved southwards to safer sites in Nyeel and Pariang to another UNHCR camps. Meanwhile, in South Sudan's Upper Nile state, where an influx of refugees from Sudan's Blue Nile state is continuing, relocation from border zones has been ongoing. About 86,000 Sudanese refugees fleeing attacks in Blue Nile state have relocated to the safety of formal sites in Doro and Jammam, Ms. Fleming said.[265] However, since the beginning of Sudanese border conflict in 2012 the UNHCR now considers the Yida refugee settlement as not safe for long-term stay due to its proximity to the volatile border zone. South Sudan authorities at central and local level are also urging refugee leaders to relocate, in line with the provisions of the 1969 OAU (now AU) Convention on Refugees. Article 2 stipulates that \"for reasons of security, countries of asylum shall, as far as possible, settle refugees at a reasonable distance from the frontier of their country of origin\".[266] On 23 August 2011, President Omar al-Bashir announced a two-week unilateral ceasefire in the conflict while on a surprise visit to South Kordofan state. He said the government would continue to embargo foreign aid directed toward South Kordofan, and the only humanitarian access would be through the Sudanese Red Crescent. He said that after the two-week ceasefire, \"the situation will be assessed on the ground\".[267] Groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have expressed concern about the humanitarian situation. In May 2012, researchers from the Humanitarian Policy Group at the Overseas Development Institute highlighted that the situation in South Kordofan was approaching crisis levels and called for stronger leadership and engagement from humanitarian actors, as well as a redoubling of diplomatic efforts to restart political dialogue in the hope of securing a lasting and peaceful resolution.[284]","Title":"Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16694","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_conflict_in_South_Kordofan_and_Blue_Nile"}
