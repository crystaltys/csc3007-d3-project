{"Content: ":"The Barbara Dex Award was a fan-voted accolade for the artists with the \"most striking look\" in the annual Eurovision Song Contest. Awarded from 1997 from 2021, the award originally highlighted the worst-dressed artists in the competition, until this criterion was changed in 2019. The Barbara Dex Award created by Edwin van Thillo and Rob Paardekam, the founders of the Dutch Eurovision fansite The House of Eurovision, in 1997.[1][2] It was named after Belgian singer Barbara Dex, who represented Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 wearing a self-made, semi-transparent dress, which William Lee Adams of Wiwibloggs described her \"looking like a lampshade\".[2] The Barbara Dex Award was initially awarded to the worst-dressed contestants.[3] Malta's Eurovision Song Contest 1997 entrant, Debbie Scerri, was the first recipient.[4] After two years of deciding the recipient internally, The House of Eurovision opened the award to public voting in 1999.[5] The House of Eurovision shut down after the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 and handed the Barbara Dex Award to the Belgian website Songfestival.be and its founder, Jasper van Biesen. Van Biesen hoped that this transition would broaden the award's reach.[2] Starting with the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, the award criterion was changed to the \"most notable outfit\", refined to \"most striking look\" for the 2021 contest.[3][6] Songfestival.be noted that \"this prize for the most striking outfit does not intend to say what is ugly and what is not and does not want to place the Song Contest in a bad light\".[3] On 13 March 2022, Songfestival.be announced that they would be ending the Barbara Dex Award, citing the negative connotation associated with it. Instead, the website would organise a new, replacement award for the \"most notable outfit\".[7] Following an online vote, Songfestival.be announced on 29 April that the new award would be named the \"You're a Vision Award\", adding that the new name would serve the purpose of promoting creativity, diversity and positivity in Eurovision on-stage fashion.[8] Australia's Eurovision Song Contest 2022 entrant, Sheldon Riley, was the first recipient of the new award.[9] In a January 2006 interview with ESCToday staff writer Sietse Bakker, Dex stated that there was \"nothing wrong\" with the Barbara Dex Award.[10] A 2015 poll by Wiwibloggs found Guildo Horn, Germany's 1998 Eurovision act, to be considered the worst-dressed of the previous award recipients.[11]","Title":"Barbara Dex Award - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7321","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Dex_Award"}
