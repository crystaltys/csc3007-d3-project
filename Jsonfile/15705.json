On 4 April 2022, Ukrainian authorities stated that the Russian military had left Chernihiv Oblast.[2] On 24 February 2022, at 03:27 EET (UTC+2), a captain and a corporal from the Russian 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade surrendered to elements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU) near Chernihiv.[7] On the same day, Ukraine claimed a reconnaissance platoon of the Russian 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade had surrendered.[6] Five hours later, the Ukrainian military repelled a Russian attack in Chernihiv and seized Russian equipment and documents.[19] According to the British Ministry of Defence, Russian forces had failed to capture the city and instead opted to bypass the city through an alternative route to Kyiv.[20][21] Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian forces were heading towards the nearby towns of Sedniv and Semenivka.[22] On 25 February 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Russian forces had surrounded Chernihiv and were laying siege to the city.[23] The next day, Ukrainian forces claimed the defeat of a Russian military unit that attempted to capture the city.

The woman stated that nearly all of a \"tank brigade\", part of the 35th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade which is based in Aleysk, had been killed in battle near Chernihiv; only 18 soldiers of the original 150 survived. The woman described the dead soldiers as \"mostly very young men\".

The total civilian casualty count is unknown; however, the city's mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko told reporters that he estimated 350\u2013400 civilians had been killed with up to 100 people being buried a day. Humanitarian workers claimed the same numbers, but mostly Ukrainian and Russian soldiers. Chernihiv's governor, Vyacheslav Chaus, said that secure evacuation corridors were being hastily established before an anticipated return of Russian forces to the city. Residents of the outlying town of Lukashivka reported Russian forces performed beatings and mock executions, as well as confiscating phones, passports, household items such as carpets and pillows, and executing livestock to harass the locals before the town was recaptured by Ukrainian forces on 1 April.[71] Despite fully withdrawing from the region in late March, Russian shelling of Chernihiv continued throughout April and May.
