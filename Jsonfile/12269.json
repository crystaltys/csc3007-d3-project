{"Content: ":"In medicine, dysthanasia means \"bad death\"[1] and is considered a common fault of modern medicine.[2] Dysthanasia is a term generally used when a person is kept alive artificially, in a condition where otherwise they cannot survive; sometimes for some sort of ulterior motive.[citation needed] Dysthanasia occurs when a person who is dying has their biological life extended through technological means without regard to the person's quality of life.[3] Technologies such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,[4] artificial ventilation, ventricular assist devices, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can extend the dying process. In some cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be considered a form of dysthanasia.[5][6] The term was used frequently in the investigation into the death of Formula One driver Ayrton Senna in 1994.[citation needed] The etymology of the term is from the Greek language: δυσ, dus; \"bad, difficult\" + θάνατος, thanatos; \"death\".","Title":"Dysthanasia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12269","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthanasia"}
