Before 15 January 1262/14 January 1263, Keran married Prince Leo of Armenia, eldest son and heir of King Hethum I, who became in King after his father's abdication in 1270. Born Anna, she was called Kir-Anna (Lady Anna) after her husband took the throne. This name was later shortened to Keran, or Guerane. Many words of praise were made about Queen Keran by her contemporaries. Her son Hethum claimed that \"she had a wonderful soul and a beautiful body.\" The chronicler and scribe Avetis, described her as \"a good friend to her husband in trouble and joy.\" After the birth of her last son, Keran became a nun and entered the Monastery of Trazarg, assuming the name of Theophania.
