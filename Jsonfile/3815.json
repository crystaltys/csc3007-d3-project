{"Content: ":"The Vietnam Women's Memorial is a memorial dedicated to the nurses and women of the United States who served in the Vietnam War.[1][2] It depicts three uniformed women with a wounded soldier[2] and serves as a reminder of the important support and caregiving roles that women played in the war as nurses, air traffic controllers, communication specialists, etc.[3] It is part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and is located in National Mall in Washington D.C., a short distance south of The Wall and north of the Reflecting Pool.[1] Diane Carlson Evans, RN, a former Army nurse, founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project (now the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation) in 1984.[1][2] The monument was designed by Glenna Goodacre[4] and dedicated as part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on November 11, 1993.[1][5] The memorial has been criticized for inaccuracy in that it depicts nurses giving medical care in the field. Such primary care was only given by medics and corpsmen, with nurses working in military hospitals behind the front lines.[6] Coordinates: 38°53\u203225\u2033N 77°02\u203249\u2033W﻿ / ﻿38.8904°N 77.0469°W﻿ / 38.8904; -77.0469  This District of Columbia related article is a stub.
