{"Content: ":"The sixth cholera pandemic (1899\u20131923) was a major outbreak of cholera beginning in India, where it killed more than 800,000 people, and spreading to the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe and Russia.[1] According to Leonard Rogers, following an outbreak of cholera at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, the epidemic spread to Europe via Punjab, Afghanistan, Persia, and southern Russia.[2][3] The last cholera outbreak in the United States was in 1910\u20131911 when the steamship Moltke brought infected people to New York City from Naples. Vigilant health authorities isolated the infected on Swinburne Island, built in the nineteenth century as a quarantine facility. Eleven people died, including a health care worker at the island hospital.[4][5][6] In 1913, the Romanian Army, while invading Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War, suffered a cholera outbreak that provoked 1,600 deaths.[7][8][9]","Title":"1899\u20131923 cholera pandemic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10091","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899%E2%80%931923_cholera_pandemic"}
