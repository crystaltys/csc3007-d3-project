{"Content: ":"The Keeper of the Register (more formally known as the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places) is a National Park Service (NPS) official, responsible for deciding on the eligibility of historic properties for inclusion on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).[1][2] The first to hold the office was William J. Murtagh, whose term ran from 1967 through 1979. The Keeper's authority may be delegated as they see fit.[2] The State Historic Preservation Officer for each state submits nominations to the Keeper. Upon receipt, the Keeper has 45 days to decide whether to add the property to the NRHP.[2][3][4] The Keeper of the Register role is supported by several regional reviewers, who review submissions for inclusion on the NHRP.[5] This team also is supported by several archaeologists, archivists, and historians.[5]  This National Register of Historic Places-related article is a stub.
