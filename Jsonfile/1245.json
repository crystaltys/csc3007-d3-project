{"Content: ":"In zoological nomenclature, the valid name of a taxon is the sole correct scientific name. The valid name should be used for that taxon, instead of any other name that may currently be being used, or may previously have been used. A name is valid when, and only when, it is in harmony with all the relevant rules listed in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).[1] A valid name is the correct zoological name of a taxon.[2] In contrast, a name which violates the rules of the ICZN is known as an invalid name. An invalid name is not considered to be the correct scientific name for a taxon.[3] There are numerous different kinds of invalid names. Subjectively invalid names are names that have been rendered invalid by individual scientific judgement or opinion. Taxonomists may differ in their opinion, and names considered invalid by one researcher may be considered valid by another; thus these are still potentially valid names. They include: Objectively invalid names are names that have been rendered invalid for factual reasons. These names are universally accepted as invalid, and are not merely a matter of individual opinion, as is the case with subjectively invalid names. They include: Under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the term validly published name has a different meaning that corresponds to zoology's available name.[5] The botanical equivalent of zoology's term \"valid name\" is correct name.","Title":"Valid name (zoology) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"1245","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valid_name_(zoology)"}
