{"Content: ":"The Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic are Russian puppet states in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Both declared independence from Ukraine following an illegal and internationally unrecognized status referendum in 2014. The government of Ukraine regards the entities as being under terrorist control. The DPR and the LPR attempted to enter into a union in 2014, namely \"Novorossiya\", although the project was abandoned by 2015. In 2014, South Ossetia\u2014itself a breakaway quasi-state supported by Russia; claimed by Georgia\u2014recognized the independence of both quasi-states. The two quasi-states were recognized as sovereign states by Russia on 21 February 2022, followed by Abkhazia\u2014another breakaway quasi-state supported by Russia; claimed by Georgia\u2014four days later.[1][2] The two quasi-states were later recognized by two more United Nations-recognized countries; Syria on 29 June 2022,[3][4] and North Korea on 13 July 2022.[5] In November 2014, representatives of Novorossiya sent a request of diplomatic recognition to several Latin American states, including Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.[7] None of the states answered the request. In May 2015, the confederation of Novorossiya was \"frozen\" due to its \"incompatibility with the Normandy Format plan of peace settlement\", promoting for DPR and LPR becoming autonomous regions within the Ukrainian borders.[8][9] The territory controlled by the two republics is recognized by almost all countries in the world as parts of Ukraine, except by Russia and by other countries showing their support for Russia's stance for recognition. The Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics have only received international recognition from each other (between Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic, respectively), from Russia, Abkhazia and from South Ossetia. On 15 February 2022, the Russian State Duma voted to ask President Vladimir Putin to recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in Ukraine as independent states. The bill was proposed by the Communist Party.[10][11][12][13] On 21 February 2022, the State Duma of Russia passed a bill to officially recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in Eastern Ukraine as independent states. The bill was approved by President Vladimir Putin.[14] On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, and also signed agreements on friendship, cooperation, and assistance with the republics.[15] On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, part of which including troops in the two territories. While, this recognition just fully followed by Abkhazia on 25 February 2022, with President Decree that signed by Aslan Bzhania to support Russia stance in recognize Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic. A poll released by the independent Levada Center found that 45% of Russians backed Russia's recognition of the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.[16] State Duma deputy Mikhail Matveev voted in favor of the recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk but later denounced the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating \"I voted for peace, not for war. I wanted Russia to become a shield so that Donbas would not be bombed, not for Kyiv to be bombed.\"[17] As a response to the recognition, Ukraine ruptured all of its diplomatic relations with Syria, and Syria did the same towards Ukraine on 20 July 2022.[25] Prior to relations being ruptured, the embassies of the two countries were closed in 2016 and 2018 respectively during the Syrian civil war. As a result of the recognition, Ukraine has ruptured its diplomatic relations with North Korea.[28] An OSCE report on war crimes implies that they are not \"independent States\" nor \"simply co-belligerents of Russia\", refers to their status as \"self-proclaimed 'republics'\", Russia's \"proxies\", and \"under overall control of Russia\", and states that therefore Russia is responsible for their conduct in the commission of crimes against international humanitarian law.[120]","Title":"International recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16092","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_Donetsk_People%27s_Republic_and_the_Luhansk_People%27s_Republic"}
