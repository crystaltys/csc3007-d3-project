Till date, West Bengal has the capacity of testing little more than 9000 samples in a day whereas Rajasthan has built the capacity of testing ~12000 samples per day. The West Bengal state government has identified 7 hotspots as of 7 April 2020. The names of hotspots are not officially disclosed. There are rumours that Kolkata, Howrah, Belgharia, Haldia, Egra, Tehatta and Kalimpong are the 7 hotspots. People living here have been asked to stay inside.[21][22] 14 March: Government on Saturday announced that all schools, colleges and universities in the state will remain closed till 31 March, in the view of evolving situation on the spread of COVID-19.[23] 17 March: State government stepped up its defence with chief minister Mamata Banerjee announcing the closure of educational institutions till 15 April.

On 1 April, Banerjee claimed that the West Bengal Government have already traced 54 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering during the COVID-19 Outbreak, and 44 of them are foreigners. Although according to a report by central security agencies, 232 people had attended the Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat event from West Bengal. Of this, 123 are Indian nationals and 109 are foreigners.[31][32] Sooner she clarified that her government has acted swiftly after the Nizamuddin area was declared as a hotspot where nearly 2,300 people were staying despite the lockdown. She further added that the government has quarantined 177 people, including 108 foreigners, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz.[33][34][35] The West Bengal Government has been also criticised for not sending enough samples to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) for testing.[36][37] West Bengal test numbers saw some rise after talks between government and NICED. According to them, this will be scaled up further in coming days.[38] The West Bengal Government has also been recommended to ensure transparency, genuine and verifiable data of COVID-19 by the West Bengal Doctors Forum (WBDF), as doctors cannot afford to send wrong signals to the world. The doctors also hit out at the idea of the bureaucratic system to identify the death of COVID-19 patients. Their spokesperson claimed that every doctor is qualified enough and does not need a committee for such certification.[39] On April 25, 2020, The WB Govt admitted that 57 COVID-19 patients died but also said that 39 from comorbidities, after Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) seeks report. The IMCT also pointed out flaws of the Govt in their letter to the Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, in which the letter read: There were a large number of patients in the isolation wards of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) as well as MR Bangur hospitals awaiting COVID test results for five days or longer. Specifically at CNCI, there were four patients awaiting test result since April 16, 2020, two patients awaiting test result since April 17, 2020, and three since April 18, 2020. Some of the patients have tested negative. It is not clear why the test results should take such a long time and there is a danger of COVID-19 negative patient acquiring the infection in the hospital while awaiting test result[40] On February 18, 2021, News18 published an article on their site by the headline \"West Bengal Health Dept Left Over 1 Lakh Covid-19 Reports Exposed to Public Search\". According to the article by News18, Sourajeet Majumder an independent security researcher discovered that the official Government site of West Bengal Health & Family Welfare Department was leaking over 1 Lakh reports of COVID-19 tests done in the state. These reports contained sensitive information in them like patient's name, age, residence address, address of referring hospital (in some cases) and the exact date and time of testing which according to Sourajeet could be easily accessed by anyone and could contribute significantly to identity scams, cyber blackmail efforts and identity thefts. The article further stated that Majumder reached out to CERT-In, who acknowledged the breach to Majumder. Sourajeet also claimed that he had reached out to the system coordinator, who manages the West Bengal State Health Department website. However, as per February 18, 2021, the concerned person issued no response. News18 independently verified Majumder's claims. In the wake of the pandemic situation, the West Bengal Government appealed to contribute in the West Bengal State Emergency Relief Fund and assist the State in prevention and control of COVID-19 situation. The details of how to contribute could be found here: https://wb.gov.in/COVID-19.aspx Many Non Government Organizations, Clubs, Religious Organizations, Political Parties, Persons and NRIs take part in COVID-19 Pandemic control besides Government Efforts.[41] Baranagore Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama High School was continuing the relief services to the families affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic during first wave of COVID-19.[42] Ex-students of this school organised a COVID relief fund and delivered much-needed oxygen, food, and necessary things to COVID-19 affected patients and their families of Baranagar and neighborhood areas of North Kolkata during second wave of COVID-19.[43] Red Volunteers are providing ground level helps to COVID-19 affected citizens.[44] West Bengal Doctors Forum, a non-government organization of doctors joined hands with SwitchON to provide free telemedicine services.[45] In light of increased oxygen demand in second wave of COVID-19, a Kolkata-based non-government organization liver foundation in collaboration with the West Bengal government's health department started a project called 'Oxygen on Wheels' to provide free oxygen to those in need.[46] Doctors from R.G. Kar Medical College developed People Care Network App to organize COVID-19 related leads and resources to help citizens.[47] An NGO from West Bengal, working for underprivileged started locating people with COVID-19 Symptoms and providing medical help.[48] The centre has identified 170 COVID-19 hotspot districts in 25 states across India. The states have been asked to classify hotspot areas as red zones and focus on converting the red zones to orange and then green zones. The West Bengal government on Monday released a list, saying four districts, including Kolkata, have been declared as red zones in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, and 348 areas as containment zones, out of which Kolkata has 227. There are some districts in Orange & Green zones. The lockdown process will be strict in those Red Zone Containment areas. Some relaxation will be given to Orange zones and Most relaxation will be given to Green Zones. The West Bengal government has been sharing regular updates of the lists of containment zones from 4 May 2020.[51][52][53][54]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in West Bengal - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10429","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_West_Bengal"}
