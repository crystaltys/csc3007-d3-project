Created in 1989, it succeeded GPPFV (Portuguese group of producers of Phonograms and videograms) and UNEVA (Union of audio and video editors). The AFP is the Portuguese group of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The AFP gathers the main record publishers that operate in the Portuguese market and its affiliates represent more than 95% of the market. The AFP has two official charts:[1] The weekly album chart includes the best-selling albums based on physical sales. Starting in 2021, it started including digital sales, with streaming still not accounting for the chart. A Portuguese singles chart existed from July 2000 until March 2, 2004. Previously a singles chart was published pre-1994 by the AFP. The chart was based on retail data compiled by the local arm of ACNielsen.[2] Starting in 2016, AFP started publishing the top 100 best-selling singles every week based on sales and streaming. In 2020, the list was upgraded to include the 200 best-selling singles.
