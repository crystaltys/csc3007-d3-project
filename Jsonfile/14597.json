It is headed by a director, who was of a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Grade. However, since the late 1970s, the position of Deputy Inspector General of Police - CID (DIG/CID) was established. The CID handles cases of a very serious nature that require specialist skills and complex detection. While the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) has taken over most counter-terrorist investigations in the police when directed by Inspector General of Police or the Secretary of Defence to investigate a specific incidence the CID takes over the investigation from the relevant jurisdictional Police Station and cooperates with other intelligence agencies in the investigation.[1]","Title":"Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14597","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Investigation_Department_(Sri_Lanka)"}
