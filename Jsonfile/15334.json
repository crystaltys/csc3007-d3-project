The simulated raid on the region was a test case of neutralizing Russian missile systems.[19] Altogether, in August-September 2020, American nuclear weapons carriers flew over international waters in the vicinity of the Norwegian Sea.[20] In 2021, NATO expected to conduct 95 NATO exercises and NATO countries were expected to conduct 220 other national and multinational exercises.[12] The NATO exercises were to include 24 land-focused exercises, 24 air exercises, 9 maritime exercises and 20 multi-domain exercises.
