{"Content: ":"The first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was announced by the state of Washington on January 21, 2020. Washington made the first announcement of a death from the disease in the U.S. on February 29 and later announced that two deaths there on February 26 were also due to COVID-19. Until mid-March, Washington had the highest absolute number of confirmed cases and the highest number per capita of any state in the country,[1] until it was surpassed by New York state on April 10, 2020. Many of the deceased were residents of a nursing home in Kirkland, an Eastside suburb of Seattle in King County. Governor Jay Inslee issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020, to last at least two weeks.[2][3] Washington had 1,726,045 confirmed cases and a total of 13,561 confirmed deaths as of July 25, 2022. Public health experts agree that the true number of cases in the state is much greater than the number that have been confirmed by laboratory tests. It is very difficult to know the true number since most people experience only mild illness and testing is not widely available.[4] As of May 28, 2021[update], Washington has administered 7,452,579 COVID-19 vaccine doses, and has fully vaccinated 3,143,910 people, equivalent to 42.46 percent of the population.[5] On June 30, 2021, the state plans to re-open fully, allowing all business to operate at full capacity. Full reopening may occur sooner if 70% of the state's population get their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination.[6] On January 21, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first U.S. case in a 35-year-old man living in Snohomish County. He had returned from Wuhan, China after visiting his family there, to the U.S., landing at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport on January 15, without any symptoms. He reported to an urgent care clinic with symptoms of pneumonia on January 19 and was transported to Everett's Providence Regional Medical Center the following day.[43][44][45] He was released from the hospital on February 3 after two weeks of treatment, including the use of the anti-viral drug remdesivir,[46][47] and went into isolation at home.[47][48] Some earlier cases, not confirmed by PCR, have also been reported as far back as December 2019.[49] On February 19, 2020, a resident of a Life Care Centers of America nursing home in Kirkland, an Eastside King County suburb of Seattle, was transferred to a local hospital and later tested positive for COVID-19.[50] On February 24, a 54-year-old man was transferred from the Life Care Center of Kirkland to Harborview Medical Center and died there on February 26. Also on the 26th, a woman in her 80s from the center died at her family home. Both were found to have had COVID-19 and in one case this was discovered in post-mortem testing.[51] The two deaths were announced on March 3.[52] On February 28, a high school student at Henry M. Jackson High School in Mill Creek, Washington was confirmed as having the virus causing the school to be closed immediately; Mariner High School in Everett was also closed because a student's parent had the virus.[53] The following day, researchers confirmed the coronavirus strain in the student's case may be related to the coronavirus strain in the first confirmed U.S. case from January 19, suggesting that the virus may have been spreading in the area for up to six weeks.[54][55] Also on February 28, a woman in her 50s who had recently returned from South Korea and who was an employee of the United States Postal Service at its Network Distribution Center facility in Federal Way, King County, tested positive.[56][57] On February 29, Washington health officials made the first announcement of a death from COVID-19 in the United States (it was later discovered that a COVID-19 death occurred in California at least as early as February 6[58]). A man in his late 50s with pre-existing chronic illness died at EvergreenHealth's hospital in Kirkland. He was not associated with the Life Care Center and although patients from the center were also in the hospital, it was not believed that any patients contracted the virus at the hospital. Officials said there was no evidence he contracted the virus through travel and they suspected community spread of the disease in King County.[59][60] The man had not been tested for the virus until February 28, partly because the lab in Washington was not ready to conduct tests, and partly because until late February the CDC had been recommending testing only for those with COVID-19 symptoms who had recently traveled to China.[61] Public health officials also reported two confirmed cases in the Life Care Center nursing home, including a woman in her 40s who was a health care worker at the facility.[62] On March 1, state public health officials confirmed two new cases in King County, both men in their 60s. One was hospitalized in critical condition at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle; the other was hospitalized in \"critical but stable\" condition at the Valley Medical Center in Renton.[63] Those two cases were not linked to the cases in the nursing facility that were reported on February 29.[64][65] Later the same day, officials reported four new cases associated with the Life Care long-term care facility: a woman in her 80s, a woman in her 90s, a man aged 70s who had died, and a man in his 70s in critical condition. Washington reported one additional case: a man in his 40s in critical condition, bringing the state's total to seven new cases reported on this day. The second death from coronavirus in the U.S. was reported at EvergreenHealth Kirkland.[66] On March 2, officials announced another four deaths in the state, bringing the U.S. death toll to six.

This will lead to more permanent closures and end more dreams. What makes it frustrating is we believe we could have worked together to make good decisions.\"[280] Restaurant owners have been pushing back on the claims made by Jay Inslee that data supports the decision to close indoor dining. The CEO of Fire and Vine Hospitality, which owns a group of restaurants in the Seattle area, Chad Mackay, says the data doesn't support such strict measures on restaurants, and that the government has not been consistent in the use and application of that data. He stated on a local talk radio station, \"...The contact tracing that was done showed that less than half a percent of infections were contact traced back to restaurants. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been arguing, saying why are we not looking at that data. And now they say that data is wrong. I think the great line was \u2018an absence of evidence doesn\u2019t mean an evidence of absence,\u2019 which means we don't know.\" He claims that the Governor is citing a study done by Stanford about the spread of COVID-19 in restaurants and notes that the study does not argue for shutdowns, but rather capacity restrictions.[281]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Washington (state) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10809","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Washington_(state)"}
