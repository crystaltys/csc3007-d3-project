Underwood said of the event, \"I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out.\"[11] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball.[12] Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian.[9] She chose not to pursue singing after graduation.
