Underwood said of the event, \"I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out.\"[11] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball.[12] Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian.[9] She chose not to pursue singing after graduation.

I had reached a point in my life where I had to be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'\".[12] She attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, graduating magna cum laude, in 2006, with a bachelor's degree in mass communication and an emphasis in journalism.[13] She spent part of one of her summers as a page for Oklahoma State Representative Bobby Frame.[14] She also waited tables at a pizzeria, worked at a zoo, and at a veterinary clinic.[12] Underwood is an alumna of the Alpha Iota chapter of Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority.[15] For two summers, she performed in Northeastern State University's Downtown Country show in Tahlequah.
