{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Nigeria was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian national in Lagos tested positive for the virus.[4][5] On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, a Nigerian citizen who came into contact with the Italian national.[6][7] The effect of the virus in Nigeria has become notable worldwide for being extremely understated, as there have been just under 255,000 confirmed cases in a country of 200 million+; however, there has been far less testing for the virus in Nigeria than other countries.[8] Deaths however have been minimal (3,143). This has been credited to a warmer climate, far younger populations (less people in care homes), faster government responses, and, crucially, experience in dealing with recent epidemics, such as the Ebola virus, that most Western countries lacked.[9][10] On 28 January 2020, the Federal government of Nigeria assured citizens of the country of its readiness to strengthen surveillance at five international airports in the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus.[11] The government announced the airports as Enugu, Lagos, Rivers, Kano and the FCT.[12] The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control also announced same day that they had already set up coronavirus group and was ready to activate its incident system if any case emerged in Nigeria.[13] On 31 January, following the developments of COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China and other countries worldwide, the federal government of Nigeria set up a Coronavirus Preparedness Group to mitigate the impact of the virus if it eventually spreads to the country.[14][15] On the same day, the World Health Organization listed Nigeria among other 13 African countries identified as high-risk for the spread of the virus.[16] On 26 February, a Chinese citizen presented himself to the Lagos State government on suspicion of being infected with coronavirus. He was admitted at Reddington Hospital and was released the following day after testing negative.[17][18][19]  On 27 February, Nigeria confirmed its first case in Lagos State, an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria had returned on 25 February from Milan, Italy through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, fell ill on 26 February and was transferred to Lagos State biosecurity facilities for isolation and testing.[20][21] On 9 March, the second case was confirmed, a Nigerian citizen in Ewekoro, Ogun State who had contact with the Italian citizen.[22][23][24] On 13 March, Nigeria confirmed that the second case no longer had the virus in his system and thus tested negative.[25] By 31 March 139 cases and 2 deaths had been confirmed.[26] The suspected cases that Nigeria were tracing, rose to 6,000.[27] There were 1,793 cases in April, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,932. 56 deaths were confirmed, bringing the death toll to 58.[28] There were 8,230 confirmed cases in May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 10,162. 229 deaths were confirmed, bringing the death toll to 287.[29] There were 15,532 confirmed cases in June, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 25,694. 303 deaths were confirmed, bringing the death toll to 590.[30] 17,457 cases were reported in July, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 43,151. 289 deaths were reported, bringing the death toll to 879.[31] 10,857 cases were reported in August, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 54,008. 134 deaths were reported, bringing the death toll to 1,013.[32] 4,840 cases and 99 deaths were reported in September, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 58,848 and 1,112 respectively. There were 50,358 recoveries as of 30 September, leaving 7,378 active cases.[33] During the significant drop of the cases recorded between September and November 2020 that lead to the relaxation of the lockdowns and re-opening of the economy to prevent the second phase of economic meltdown, the isolation centres in most states were partially closed, and the country relaxed the usage of face-masks in public places such as markets, public offices, event centers, restaurants, and bars.[34] There were 4,005 new cases in October, bringing the total number of cases from the start of the outbreak to 62,853. The death toll rose by 32 to 1,144. There were 3,034 active cases at the end of the month.[35] Model-based simulations indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t was close to 1.0 in October.[36] There were 4,704 new cases in November, bringing the total number of cases to 67,557. The death toll rose to 1,173. There were 3,102 active cases at the end of the month.[37] On 10 December, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, the Health Minister said that the second wave is imminent because of the rising number of cases; he added that the rise in cases was mostly driven by an increase in infections within communities and, to a lesser extent, travelers entering Nigeria.[38] On the same day, Secretary to the Government of the Federation and chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha said that the second wave of the pandemic has begun, following the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases detected in the country.[39] Nigeria recorded its highest daily number of COVID-19 cases on 17 December with 1,145 new infections. The Presidential Task Force said that this increase in cases showed that the country entered the second wave of the pandemic.[40][41][42] On 24 December, John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told an online news conference from Addis Ababa that another new coronavirus variant has been found in Nigeria. Nkengasong announced \u201cIt\u2019s a separate lineage from the UK and the South African lineages.\u201d[43] There were 19,953 new cases in December, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 87,510.
