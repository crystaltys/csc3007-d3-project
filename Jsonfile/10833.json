The virus was confirmed to have reached Tuvalu on 20 May 2022.[1][2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] Circa 26 March 2020, the acting governor general declared a state of emergency.[8] As of 24 August 2021 in reporting to the WHO, there have been zero confirmed COVID-19 cases; and as of 15 August, 4,772 vaccines doses have been administered.[9] On 2 November, a traveller from Tuvalu tested positive when arriving to New Zealand, suggesting possible spread of the virus in the country, but no cases have been officially reported by the local authorities of the country.[10] Acting Prime Minister Minute Alapati Taupo on 20 May 2022 announced that three cases were detected in quarantine, while other three cases are suspicious.[1][2] This article about the COVID-19 pandemic is a stub.
