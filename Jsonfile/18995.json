{"Content: ":"The Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Nobel Peace Prize annually \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and awarded by a committee of five people elected by the Parliament of Norway.[2] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma, and a monetary award prize (that has varied throughout the years).[3] It is one of the five prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[4] The Peace Prize is presented annually in Oslo, in the presence of the King of Norway, on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death, and is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm.[5] Unlike the other prizes, the Peace Prize is occasionally awarded to an organisation (such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, a three-time recipient) rather than an individual. The Nobel Peace Prize was first awarded in 1901 to Frédéric Passy and Henry Dunant \u2014 who shared a Prize of 150,782 Swedish kronor (equal to 7,731,004 kronor in 2008) \u2014 and, Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov most recently, in 2021. As of 2021[update], the Peace Prize has been awarded to 109 individuals and 25 organizations. Eighteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize, more than any other Nobel Prize.[7] Only two recipients have won multiple Peace Prizes: the International Committee of the Red Cross has won three times (1917, 1944 and 1963) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won twice (1954 and 1981).[6] There have been 19 years in which the Peace Prize was not awarded.
