{"Content: ":"Meduza (Russian: Медуза, lit. 'jellyfish')[2][3] is a Russian- and English-language news website focusing on news in Russia and across the former Soviet Union[4], based in Latvia. It was founded in 2014 by a group of former employees of the Russian Lenta.ru news website.[5][6][7] Free mobile applications for iOS, Windows Phone and Android became the basis of the media.[8] In 2014, Galina Timchenko was fired from her job as chief editor at Lenta.ru and launched the new webpage Meduza in October 2014.[6] Several former journalists of Lenta.ru joined the new online site.[9] Timchenko told Forbes that the decision to base Meduza in Latvia was made since \"right now, establishing an independent Russian language publishing house in Latvia is possible, while in Russia it is not\".[10] Moreover, Timchenko stated: \"We understood that in Russia, most likely, they would not let us work.\"[11] Russian businessman and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and telecommunications magnate Boris Zimin had been considered as passive investors, but they parted ways \"for strategic and operational reasons\".[10] For financial reasons, Timchenko and her partner at Amond & Smith Ltd, Sergey Nazarkin, based Meduza in Latvia.[12] In February 2015, the website also launched an English-language version. In January 2016, founder and CEO Galina Timchenko handed over the role of chief editor to her deputy Ivan Kolpakov.[13] In November 2018, Kolpakov announced his resignation due to a sexual harassment scandal.[14] He was reinstated as chief editor on March 11, 2019.[1] In August 2017, Meduza started a partnership with the American news website BuzzFeed News.[15] The partnership included publishing each other\u2019s materials, sharing experiences, and carrying out and publishing joint investigations.[16] In 2019, Meduza started the English podcast The Naked Pravda, which highlights how Meduza's top reporting intersects with the wider research and expertise that exists about Russia.[17] Meduza condemned the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine;[18] as a reaction, the site has been blocked on the territory of Russia by Roskomnadzor.[19] On March 11, Reporters Without Borders announced a mirror site[20] has been set up.[21] Meduza is run by a team of around 20 journalists[citation needed] who resigned from their jobs at Lenta.ru following Galina Timchenko's unexpected removal from her post by the website's owner and Vladimir Putin supporter,[22] the oligarch Alexander Mamut. There are no Latvian journalists in the project. Since March 2015, Meduza has published daily news called \u201cEvening Meduza\u201d.[11] Three months after opening, Meduza had 1.3 million monthly readers of its Internet publication.[23] In 2017, Meduza had 7.5 million readers per month and 2 million followers on social media.[24] In 2020, Meduza was the leader in social media citations in the rating compiled by Medialogia [Wikidata], a company that monitors and analyzes media and social networks.[25] On October 20, at the outlet\u2019s annual celebration, Meduza chief editor and co-founder Ivan Kolpakov groped the buttocks of an employee\u2019s wife, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one at this party I can harass and get away with it.\u201d.[26] Kolpakov was suspended for the investigation. After reviewing the facts, Meduza\u2019s board of directors on November 6 formally censured Kopakov's behavior at the anniversary party, but reinstated him as chief editor.[26] This triggered massive social media backfire.[27] On November 9 Kolpakov announced his resignation saying that \"it is the only way to stop the crisis engulfing the website and minimize the damage to its reputation\".[28] At the beginning of 2019, it became known that, despite the dismissal, Kolpakov continues to cooperate with the editorial office and may soon officially return to a leadership position (presumably as a publisher). This information was confirmed by Galina Timchenko.[29] Kolpakov was re-appointed editor-in-chief of Meduza on March 11, 2019.[30] According to Timchenko, Meduza will not only serve as an aggregator but will also produce its own content. So it aims to fill a market niche that exists due to \"a long list of forbidden topics which Russian media do not raise for various reasons\u2014due to direct and indirect censorship\".[10] The day after it was launched, Meduza was blocked in Kazakhstan, probably due to an article about the city of Oskemen (Ust-Kamenogorsk).[31][32] Access to the site has also been blocked in Uzbekistan.[32] The reasons for this are unclear.[citation needed] Meduza has installed technical measures to circumvent censorship with their mobile apps.[33] In June 2019, Meduza journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested by Russian police for claimed drug offences.[34] Colleagues and friends of Golunov said they believed the charges to be fabricated, motivated by his investigations into corruption.[35] Following a public outcry, Golunov was released, and five police officers were fired and later arrested.[36] On April 23, 2021, the Russian Ministry of Justice designated Meduza as a \"foreign agent\".[37][38] In response, the European Union rejected the decision, saying this restriction \"goes against Russia's international obligations and human rights commitments\".[39][40][41][42] Meduza condemned the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine;[18] as a reaction, the site has been blocked on the territory of Russia by Roskomnadzor.[19] Russian journalist Ilya Krasilshchik, the former publisher of Meduza, was charged under the \"fake news\" law for denouncing the war in Ukraine.[43]","Title":"Meduza - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16041","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meduza"}
