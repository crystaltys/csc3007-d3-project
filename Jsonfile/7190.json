{"Content: ":"The Eurovision Song Contest 1996 was the 41st edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Oslo, Norway, following the country's victory at the 1995 contest with the song \"Nocturne\" by Secret Garden. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK), the contest was held at Oslo Spektrum 18 May 1996. The contest was presented by Norwegian journalist Ingvild Bryn and lead singer of a-ha Morten Harket. Twenty-three countries participated in the contest. Prior to the event, a non-televised audio-only qualification round was organised by the EBU, in order to shortlist the number of participating nations that would compete in the televised final from twenty-nine, to a more manageable twenty-three.[1] Germany, Israel, Denmark, Hungary, Russia, Macedonia, and Romania all failed to qualify. That means that 1996 remains the only year when Germany did not participate in the contest. The winner was yet again Ireland with the song \"The Voice\", performed by Eimear Quinn and written by Brendan Graham. This was the country's fourth win in just five years, having also won three years in a row between 1992\u20131994. This win cemented Ireland as the country with the most wins in Eurovision history (they already broke the record for most wins in 1994). Norway, Sweden, Croatia and Estonia rounded out the top five, with the last of those countries achieving their first top five placing in their participation. Further down the table, Portugal also achieved their best result to date, finishing sixth. The 1996 contest took place in Oslo, Norway, following the country's victory at the 1995 contest with the song \"Nocturne\", performed by Secret Garden. It was the second time that Norway had hosted the contest, following the 1986 contest staged in Bergen.[2] The chosen venue was the Oslo Spektrum, an indoor arena opened in 1990 and located in the Sentrum district of the city, which has hosted music concerts, ice hockey matches and the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert.[3][4] The arena's maximum capacity of 11,500 was reduced to around 6,000 for the contest.[5] The Eurovision Song Contest 1996 was produced by the Norwegian public broadcaster Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK). Odd Arvid Strømstad served as executive producer, Pål Veiglum served as director, Bjarte Ulfstein served as designer, and Frode Thingnæs served as musical director, leading the Norwegian Radio Orchestra.[1][6] The presenters were Morten Harket and Ingvild Bryn. Harket, lead singer of a-ha, opened the show with a performance of his single \"Heaven's Not for Saints\", which was a hit in Norway at the time. The 1996 contest also introduced three novelties which failed to become traditions in the contest. Firstly a short 'good luck message' for each entry, recorded by a political leader or official from their country. The seniority of the figure who delivered the message varied wildly from country to country, ranging from Presidents and Prime Ministers on one end of the spectrum to junior ministers or ambassadors on the other, but a few very significant European political figures did appear, including long-serving Swedish premier Göran Persson, President Alija Izetbegović of Bosnia and Herzegovina and future UN Secretary-General António Guterres, then Prime Minister of Portugal. But of course the only good luck wish that was fully rewarded in the end was that of Irish Taoiseach John Bruton, who introduced the song that took his country to a fourth win in five years.[1] Secondly, the voting section was conducted using chroma key virtual reality technology provided by Silicon Graphics. The host Ingvild Bryn introduced the viewers to the \"blue room\", upon which a 3D scoreboard, views of the green room, the jury spokespersons and country graphics appeared. The only physical aspects were Ingvild herself and two podiums. For the first time in the contest's history, a jury spokesperson came to stage to deliver the scores rather than via telephone or video link. The Norwegian spokesperson Ragnhild Sælthun Fjørtoft joined Ingvild Bryn in the blue screen set to announce Norway's scores.[1] The virtual scoreboard only listed the name of the country and their total score, omitting the nation's flags for the first time since 1984. Prior to 1985, flags had only appeared on the scoreboard in 1977 and 1982. Scoreboard flags returned in 1997 and have appeared regularly on most scoreboards since; the only exceptions being 2000 and 2001. Finally, the name itself of the Eurovision Song Contest was changed this year, re-branded and referred to this year as Eurosong '96. The name was quickly dropped and reverted back to the Eurovision Song Contest the following year.[7] In 1996 all contestants were wished good luck by a politician from their own country in their own language.[8] These pre-recorded messages were shown right before their performance. This was the only year in Eurovision with such wishes. The individuals who provided messages are shown below, alongside the position which they held at the time of the contest and the language in which they recorded their message. The European Broadcasting Union continued to experiment in their efforts to find a broadly acceptable method of whittling down the large number of potential participating countries to a more realistic figure.[1] This year, they reverted to including a qualifying round that had been used for the 1993 contest, but this time with just one country exempt from the process \u2013 the host Norway. The audio-only qualification round, which was never televised or broadcast on radio, was used by the EBU in order to shortlist the number of participating nations that would compete in the televised final.[1] With exception to the hosts Norway, audio entries from twenty-nine countries were played to national juries, of which only twenty-two proceeded to the televised final in Oslo.[1] Countries listed below submitted entries for the audio-only qualification round, which was not televised.[9] Countries were ordered alphabetically by ISO two-letter country code. Planned entries from Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine have been reported which ultimately did not materialise, with Bulgaria's name still appearing on the qualifier jury voting sheets. All three countries would eventually make their debut in the 2000s.[10][8] Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Macedonia, Romania and Russia all failed to qualify. As a result, Macedonia's submission was never classified as a debut entry by the EBU, with the nation eventually going on to make their official televised debut in 1998.[1][11] The full results of the qualifying round were not made public at the time, but have since become available. Hungary and Finland tied on the same score for the final qualification place, however Finland qualified for the final due to them having received the highest individual score (8 points) compared to Hungary (7 points).[8] It rapidly became evident that this system was no more sustainable than any other the EBU had tried, as it meant that several countries had gone through their traditional full-blown national selection procedure to come up with an entry, only to suffer the anti-climax of having their challenge quietly extinguished without even having had the opportunity of presenting the song to an international audience. As a leading financial contributor to the contest, Germany were particularly aggrieved that their entry was one of the seven cast aside. It was the only year in the history of the ESC in which Germany did not participate in the final.[1] Each performance had a conductor who led the orchestra.[14][8] This marked the final year in which every song featured the orchestra to some extent, although some more minimally than others (such as Austria or the United Kingdom); from 1997 full backing tracks were permitted, and from 1999 the orchestra was abolished in its entirety. Each country had a jury that awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) for their top ten songs. One year later, televoting would be introduced in only some countries, such as Sweden and the United Kingdom. When Belén Fernández de Henestrosa, the Spanish spokesperson, announced the votes of the Spanish jury, she awarded two points to \"Czechoslovakia\" (while meaning 'Slovakia'). Furthermore, she awarded six points to \"Holland\" (the Netherlands), which host Ingvild Bryn misheard as \"Poland\". The official results table corrected this error, and the Netherlands' seventh-place result was restored at the expense of the United Kingdom, who ultimately finished eighth. Because originally Poland was awarded six points from Spain, Greece was placed 14th over Poland after the official results table corrected this error.[1] Norway's entry, \"I evighet\", is notable for being the only runner-up not to receive a single \"12 points\" score in a Eurovision final since this voting method was introduced in 1975. Below is a summary of all 12 points in the qualifying round. Below is a summary of all 12 point in the final:[17] The spokespersons announced the score from their respective country's national jury in running order. Most countries sent commentators to Oslo or commented from their own country, in order to provide coverage of the contest, such as add insight to the participants.","Title":"Eurovision Song Contest 1996 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7190","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1996"}
