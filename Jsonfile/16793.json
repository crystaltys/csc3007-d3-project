{"Content: ":"Putin's Plan (Russian: план Путина) is an informal reference for a political and economic program of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Neither Putin nor his team officially released any comprehensive program.[1] Slogans supporting \"Putin's Plan\" were a staple of the election campaign of the United Russia in the 2007 parliamentary election and the 2008 presidential election. Putin himself stated that the term is nothing but a pre-election slogan based on the excerpts from 7 years of his State of the Nation address to the Federal Assembly related to the long-term development of various spheres in the life of the country.[2] The term \"Putin's Plan\" was introduced by the chairman of the Supreme Council of United Russia Boris Gryzlov. Conceptual framework of \"Putin's Plan\" was first revealed by Director General of APEC D. Orlov in May 2007.[1] In the electoral program of the party \"United Russia\" in the parliamentary elections in 2007, \"Putin's Plan\" is stated as follows:[3] Almost immediately the expression was reinterpreted based on the Russian slang meaning of the term \"план\" for \"marijuana\", i.e., reading it as \"Putin's Weed\". A little-known band \"Корейские LЁDчики\" from Vladivostok gained in its popularity with the songs Putin and Putin's \"Plan\" [ru]).[4] the Moscow section of the Union of Right Forces sent a written request to Federal Drug Control Service of Russia to check whether \"Putin's Plan\" is a narcotic or psychotropic substance and carried out a rally against legalisation of controlled substances during which they gave out badges with various pun texts, such as \"Putin's High Rating is Due to Putin's Plan.\" [5]","Title":"Putin's Plan - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16793","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putin%27s_Plan"}
