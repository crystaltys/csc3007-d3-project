In parallel, a leftist Iranian Kurdish rebel group PJAK resumed military activities against Iran in 2016, following a long period of stalemate. The 2016 clashes came following a background of what PDKI described as \"growing discontent in Rojhelat\".[35] The commander of the PAK military wing described their engagement and declaration of hostilities against the Iranian government were due to the fact that \"the situation in eastern Kurdistan (Iranian Kurdistan) has become unbearable, especially with the daily arbitrary executions against the Kurds [in Iran]\".[36] Iran has a significant 8 million strong Kurdish minority, concentrated in the West of the country, many of whom are Sunni. The Kurds spread across the Iranian provinces of West Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Ilam. Kurdish separatism is a theme in several Middle Eastern nations, and Kurdish movements have engaged in conflicts also in Syria (Kurds in Syria), Iraq (Kurds in Iraq), and Turkey (Kurds in Turkey) to promote national ambitions.[37] The PDKI had announced the \"restart [of] armed resistance against the Islamic Republic of Iran\" on 25 February.[38] The PDKI explained that their return to arms was due to \"growing discontent in Rojhelat\".[35] According to Al-Monitor analysis, since March 2015, the PDKI has dispatched several teams of its fighters and political cadets into Iranian Kurdistan.[39] The PDKI announced in March 2016 that it was giving up a two-decade ceasefire with the Iranian government and returning its guerrilla fighters to Iran, but vowed not to initiate hostilities unless attacked.[12] In September 2016, PDKI released a statement that their return to militancy was also motivated by Iran's nuclear deal.[33] Commander of the PAK military wing described their engagement and declaration of hostilities against Iranian government due to the fact that \"the situation in eastern Kurdistan (Iranian Kurdistan) has become unbearable, especially with the daily arbitrary executions against the Kurds\".[36] On 19 April 2016, PAK's armed Peshmerga units, named Kurdistan Freedom Eagles for East Kurdistan (HAK-R), attacked Iranian government security forces in Sanandaj during annual Army Day Parade of Iran, claiming to have resumed the armed Kurdish national struggle.[40] On 4 May 2016, the PDKI Peshmerga engaged the Iranian security forces in Sardasht area, killing 8[6]-10[3] soldiers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

Saudi Arabia may have been providing financial support to all three Kurdish insurgent groups through its consulate in the Iraqi Kurdistan, which is newly opened.[77]","Title":"Western Iran clashes (2016\u2013present) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16728","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Iran_clashes_(2016%E2%80%93present)"}
