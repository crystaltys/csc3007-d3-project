{"Content: ":"Trianon is a 45-story, 186 m (610 ft) skyscraper in the Westend-SÃ¼d district of Frankfurt, Germany, completed in 1993. It is the headquarters for DekaBank; other tenants are Deutsche Bundesbank and Franklin Templeton. Atop the building is an inverted pyramid suspended from the three corners. The Trianon's layout is roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, the corners of which are formed by three-sided towers. The end is an inverted three-sided pyramid on the roof. It is the first structure in Germany to use high-strength concrete. In 2007, DekaBank sold the building to the Morgan Stanley European Office Fund (MSEOF).[5] A 57% interest in the building was later transferred to the real estate investment fund Morgan Stanley P2 Value. In June 2015, Morgan Stanley and Madison Real Estate sold the building to the US investor NorthStar Reality Europe for the equivalent of US$540 million.[6] In November 2018 NorthStar Reality Europe sold Trianon to the South Korean financial consortium IGIS and Hana Financial Investment for US$758 million.[7] Trianon as seen from Main Tower View from the base","Title":"Trianon (Frankfurt am Main) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6523","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trianon_(Frankfurt_am_Main)"}
