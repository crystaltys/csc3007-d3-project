{"Content: ":"The Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE, Chinese: 中国工程院; pinyin: Zhōngguó Gōngchéng Yuàn) is the national academy of the People's Republic of China for engineering. It was established in 1994 and is an institution of the State Council of China. The CAE and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are often referred to together as the \"Two Academies\". Its current president is Li Xiaohong. Since the establishment of CAE, entrusted by the relevant ministries and commissions, the Academy has offered consultancy to the State on major programs, planning, guidelines, and policies. With the incitation by various ministries of the central government as well as local governments, the Academy has organized its members to make surveys on the forefront, and to put forward strategic opinions and proposals. These entrusted projects have played an important role in maximizing the participation of the members in the macro decision-making of the State. In the meantime, the members, based on their own experiences and perspectives accumulated in a long term and in combination with international trends of the development of engineering science and technology, have regularly and actively put forward their opinions and suggestions. The CAE is composed of elected members with the highest honor in the community of engineering and technological sciences of the nation. The General Assembly of the CAE is the highest decision-making body of the Academy and is held during the first week of June biennially. Membership of Chinese Academy of Engineering is the highest academic title in engineering science and technology in China. It is a lifelong honor and must be elected by existing members. The Academy consists of members, senior members and foreign members, who are distinguished and recognized for their respective field of engineering.
