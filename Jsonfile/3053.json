The standard edition of the album contains ten tracks, including the singles \"Lay Me Down\" and \"Money on My Mind\".[6] In an interview with Digital Spy, Smith described the overarching theme of their album as \"sad\". Talking about the name of the album they said: \"People are saying, 'Oh but it's too sad', but that's what it's about. I was sad, heartbroken, and I wrote about being sad. Hopefully I'll be happier soon and I'll write about that.\"[7] Smith also said in an interview with The Line of Best Fit that the most personal song in this album is \"Good Thing\".[8] In another interview with Digital Spy, when asked to describe the album, they said: \"My debut album is just a diary from a lonely 21-year-old. That's what it is. It was my way of talking about the only real issue in my life. I don't have that many sad things going on in my life and it was the only thing that was really affecting me last year: I fell in love with someone who didn't love me back, and it made me get into this head space of, 'Will I find a man to love? When will I find love?' This album is my 'fuck off' to everyone and basically say, 'No, I have been in love with a man and, if anything, it was much more painful than your version', because I'm not getting what I want with a man and it's so close I can almost taste him. So, it's my way of defining what is love, and how unrequited love is just as painful, just as powerful, as what we call 'normal' love.\"[9] \"Lay Me Down\" was released as the lead single from the album on 15 February 2013. In January 2014, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 134 after Smith won the BBC Sound of 2014.

Club felt most of the songs are monotonous and lack depth, writing that they are instead showcases for Smith's \"rich\" voice on an album that is not as good as its singles.[26] Q was more critical, especially of the album's second half, writing that it \"declines into self-pity, windy balladry and squeaky-strings-as-authenticity cliché\",[21] while Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph was unimpressed by most of the songwriting and the music, calling it a watered-down version of soul.[16] Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic in his blog for Vice, writing that Smith's charmingly catchy pop songs cohere into a portrait of a man whose insecurity about love is expressed more sincerely than most other artists without indulging in self-pity: \"Both vocally and verbally, they offer the kind of emotional complexity about sexual romance's ins and outs that good pop captures better than good literature, where cynicism is such a folkway.\"[24] Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times was impressed by the variety in which Smith and their producers use their voice throughout In the Lonely Hour, which she viewed as a sign of promise with songs \"so understated yet so vibrant and accomplished\".[18] In the Lonely Hour appeared in many critics' lists of best albums of 2014, including those of Digital Spy,[27] The Daily Telegraph,[28] Time Out[29] and HuffPost.[30] The album was nominated for Best Album at the 2014 MOBO Awards, whilst Smith was also up for Best Male and Best R&B/Soul Act, and \"Stay with Me\" was nominated for Best Song.[31] Smith scooped all four awards at the ceremony on 22 October 2014.[32] On 6 December 2014, it was announced that Smith had been nominated for six awards at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for In the Lonely Hour, and Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Stay with Me\".[33] At the Grammys on 8 February 2015, Smith walked away with four awards, with In the Lonely Hour winning Best Pop Vocal Album and \"Stay with Me\" winning Song of the Year.
