{"Content: ":"The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was a federal Canadian organization that administered foreign aid programs in developing countries. The agency was merged into the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2013 by the federal government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. CIDA was formed in 1968 by the Canadian government under Lester B. Pearson. CIDA reported to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister for International Cooperation. Its mandate was to \"support sustainable development in developing countries in order to reduce poverty and contribute to a more secure, equitable, and prosperous world.\"[1] CIDA had its headquarters at 200 Promenade du Portage in Gatineau, Quebec.[2] CIDA funding was the subject of intense debate, and the Conservative government made major revisions to the funding process, including reductions to NGOs described as supporting \"left-leaning causes\", such as Montreal-based Alternatives.[3] In March 2013, the Conservative government announced that CIDA would be folded into the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the organizations renamed as the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development,[4] later renamed as Global Affairs Canada.[5] Critics said the merger would give insufficient attention to fighting poverty, but the Conservative government, and later the Liberal government that also kept CIDA programs under the same department, said the merger would lead to a more coherent international agenda.[6][7] An internal report by the agency said that it would take up to 10 years for ex-CIDA employees to get used to the merger.[6]","Title":"Canadian International Development Agency - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12954","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_International_Development_Agency"}
