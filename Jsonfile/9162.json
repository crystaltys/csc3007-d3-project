In 2021, Plan International reached 26.2 million girls and 24.1 million boys through its programming.[citation needed][2] Plan International focuses on child protection, education, child participation, economic security, emergencies, health, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and water and sanitation. Plan International provides training in disaster preparedness, response and recovery, and has worked on relief efforts in countries including Haiti,[3] Colombia[4] and Japan.[5] Plan International sponsors Girls Get Equal, a global campaign demanding power, freedom and representation for girls and young women. Plan International also led the Because I Am a Girl campaign, a global movement to ensure that girls everywhere can learn, lead, decide and thrive, which ran from 2012 to 2018.[6] Plan International was founded in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War by British journalist John Langdon-Davies and aid worker Eric Muggeridge. The organization was founded with the aim to provide food, accommodation and education to children whose lives had been disrupted by the Spanish Civil War.[citation needed] Plan International's income comes from supporters who sponsor children and the remainder is raised through donations and grants. An average of 80% of this money goes directly to supporting Plan International\u2019s development and humanitarian work.[8] The remainder is spent on fundraising initiatives and maintaining an international network of support staff. Plan International publishes annual reports detailing its fundraising and spending activity.[9] The organization receives funding to implement grants from a range of multilateral institutions, such as the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other multilateral agencies.[10] Plan International adheres to several international standards and quality assurance mechanisms including the International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGO) Commitment to Accountability Charter[11] and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief.[12] Notable people endorsers associated with Plan International include Jacqueline Kennedy, David Elliot, Beau Bridges, Dina Eastwood, Scott Bakula,[13] and Nicholas D. Kristof, also a child sponsor.[14] In 2015 Mo'ne Davis teamed up with the brand M4D3 (Make A Difference Everyday) to design a line of sneakers for girls, with some of the proceeds going toward the Plan International\u2019s Because I Am a Girl campaign.[15] Suman Pokhrel worked for Plan International Nepal as an employee joining the organization in 1998.[16] Anil Kapoor, who starred in Danny Boyle's film Slumdog Millionaire, is an ambassador for Plan India.[17] He donated his entire fee for the movie to the NGO's Universal Birth Registration campaign.[18] Slumdog Millionaire stars Dev Patel and Freida Pinto were among cast members who attended a screening of the film at Somerset House in London,[19] where over Â£2,000 was raised for Plan\u2019s work in Mumbai, the setting of the film. The organization was featured in the 2002 film About Schmidt.
