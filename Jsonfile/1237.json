{"Content: ":"Everglades virus (EVEV) is an alphavirus included in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus complex. The virus circulates among rodents and vector mosquitoes and sometimes infects humans, causing a febrile illness with occasional neurological manifestations.[2][3] Although it is said to be rare in humans it is still debated if this is the case because of the possibility of underdiagnosing as well as being a unrecognized cause of other illnesses.[4] The virus is named after the Everglades, a region of subtropical wetlands in southern Florida. The virus is endemic to the U.S. state of Florida, where its geographic range mirrors that of the mosquito species Culex cedecei.[2] Hispid cotton rat and cotton mouse are considered important reservoir hosts of Everglades virus. Most clinical cases of infection occur in and around the city of Miami.[3] The abundance in clinical cases in certain parts of Florida comes from many factors such as population density and proximity to the hosts and their ecosystem.[5] Symptoms of infection include:[6] The virus is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes of the genus Culex,[7] specifically Culex cedecei.[2][8]  This virus-related article is a stub.
