She is known for her distinctive raspy voice and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday.[3] Gray has released ten studio albums, and received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one. She has appeared in a number of films, including Training Day, Spider-Man, Scary Movie 3, Lackawanna Blues, Idlewild, For Colored Girls, and The Paperboy. Gray is best known for her international hit single \"I Try\", taken from her multi-platinum debut album On How Life Is.[4] Natalie McIntyre was born in Canton, Ohio,[5][6] the daughter of Laura McIntyre, a math schoolteacher,[7] and Otis Jones .[8] Her stepfather was a steelworker, and her sister is a biology teacher.[8] She has a younger brother, Nate, who owns a gym in West Philadelphia and was featured on the season five finale of Queer Eye.[9] She began piano lessons at age seven.[10] A childhood bicycle mishap resulted in her noticing a mailbox of a man named Macy Gray; she used the name in stories she wrote and later decided to use it as her stage name. She was late developing and did not learn to hold conversation until just before her tenth birthday.[8] Gray attended school with Brian Warner (later known as musician Marilyn Manson) although they did not know each other.[10] She attended more than one high school, including a boarding school which asked her to leave due to her behavior.[10] She attended the University of Southern California and studied scriptwriting.[8][4] While attending the University of Southern California, she agreed to write songs for a friend.[11] A demo session was scheduled for the songs to be recorded by another singer, but the vocalist failed to appear, so Gray recorded them herself. I started forming bands and writing songs just for fun and then I really got into it and got attached to it. Then a friend of mine asked me to be a singer in his jazz band. He gave me all these jazz CDs and I studied all these different singers and I kind of taught myself how to sing for a gig, but I didn't take it seriously until later.[10] She then met writer-producer Joe Solo while working as a cashier in Beverly Hills.[12] Together, they wrote a collection of songs and recorded them in Solo's studio. The demo tape gave Gray the opportunity to sing at jazz cafés in Los Angeles.[11] Although Gray did not consider her unusual voice desirable for singing,[10] Atlantic Records signed her. She began recording her debut record but was dropped from the label upon the departure of A&R man Tom Carolan, who had signed her to the label.[13] Macy returned to Ohio but in 1997 Los Angeles based Zomba Label Group Senior VP A&R man Jeff Blue, convinced her to return to music and signed her to a development deal, recording new songs based on her life experiences, with a new sound, and began shopping her to record labels.[14][15] In 1998, she landed a record deal with Epic Records.[16] She performed on \"Love Won't Wait,\" a song on the Black Eyed Peas' debut album Behind the Front.[17] Gray worked on her debut album in 1999 with producer Darryl Swann.[18] Released in the summer of 1999, On How Life Is became a worldwide smash.[19] The first single, \"Do Something,\" stalled on the charts, but the second single, \"I Try,\" made the album a success.[20] \"I Try\" (which was originally featured in Love Jones and the Jennifer Aniston-starring romantic-comedy Picture Perfect in 1997)[21] was one of the biggest singles of 1999,[22][23] and subsequent singles (\"Still\" and \"Why Didn't You Call Me\") ensured the album became triple platinum in the US[24] and quadruple platinum in the UK.[25] In 2001, Gray won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"I Try\", which was also nominated for \"song of the year\" and \"record of the year\".[26] She then collaborated with Fatboy Slim, the Black Eyed Peas, and Slick Rick (on the song \"The World Is Yours,\" from the Rush Hour 2 soundtrack), as well as acting for the first time, in the thriller Training Day.[27] In August 2001, Gray was booed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame exhibition game after forgetting the lyrics to the American national anthem.[28] Gray's The Id featured appearances by John Frusciante and Erykah Badu on the single \"Sweet Baby\" (which was co-written with longtime collaborator Joe Solo).[29] The album peaked at number eleven on the Billboard 200.[30] It fared even better in the UK, where it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the BPI.[31] In 2002, she appeared in Spider-Man and contributed a remix of her song \"My Nutmeg Phantasy\" to its accompanying soundtrack.
