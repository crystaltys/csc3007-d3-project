Naimubu maintained its operations from its office at Jalan Sagara no. 7 Djakarta until 1945.[2] On 19 August 1945 Naimubu was split into several departments: The Department of Home Affairs was the first government department established under the Presidential Cabinet of Indonesia following independence.
