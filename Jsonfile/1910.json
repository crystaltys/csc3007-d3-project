{"Content: ":"The anterior boundary of the sella turcica is completed by two small eminences, one on either side, called the middle clinoid processes. It is found lateral to the sella turcica. Clinoid likely comes from the Greek root klinein or the Latin clinare, both meaning \"sloped\" as in \"inclined.\" This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 147 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)  This human musculoskeletal system article is a stub.
