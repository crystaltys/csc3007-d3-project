{"Content: ":"The Bengal cricket team represents the Indian state of West Bengal in domestic first-class cricket. It is considered Eastern India's strongest cricket team. The team plays its home matches at the historic Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Bengal has won two Ranji Trophy victories and has been runner-up a total of 12 times.[2] Bengal won the Vijay Hazare Trophy, also known as the Ranji One Day Trophy, in 2012. Under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly, it beat Mumbai in the finals at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi on 12 March 2012.[3] Bengal's first success came in the third Ranji Trophy season (1936/37), in which it came runners-up to Nawanagar. Two years later it beat Southern Punjab in the final of the Ranji Trophy to become the 4th team to hold the title. For the next 51 years, although it had been runner-up 11 times (including the year before), it did not regain the title until it beat a strong Delhi team in the 1990 final. The team was runner-up twice consecutively in the 2005\u201306 and the 2006\u201307 season. Their ranks are occasionally bolstered by the return of Sourav Ganguly to the domestic competition. Players with international caps are listed in bold.","Title":"Bengal cricket team - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17239","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_cricket_team"}
