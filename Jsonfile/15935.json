{"Content: ":"The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF; Russian: Петербургский международный экономический форум, ПМЭФ)[1] is an annual Russian business event for the economic sector, which has been held in St. Petersburg since 1997, and under the auspices of the Russian President since 2006.[2] Each year, more than 10,000 people from over 120 different countries take part. The Forum brings together the chief executives of major Russian and international companies, heads of state, political leaders, prime ministers, deputy prime ministers, departmental ministers, and governors. The key purpose of the Forum is to provide practical solutions for businesses and governments, helping to overcome the geographic and information barriers between Russia and other countries. The forum was historically intended for Russia to attract foreign direct investment, discuss economic policy and project a global image that Russia was open for business after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[3] The SPIEF forum has often been described as the 'Russian Davos'; ie. the Russian analogue of the World Economic Forum that is usually held in Davos, Switzerland.[3][4][5] Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading politicians and business executives from the Western world and their allies (included within the Unfriendly Countries List) were notably absent from SPIEF events. In response, SPIEF forums have adjusted their focus to highlight leading politicians and business executives from various countries such as the People's Republic of China, India, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Serbia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Nicaragua and the Central African Republic.[3] In addition, delegations from disputed polities such as the Taliban, Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Palestine were among the notables present at the 2022 forum.[6] The first St. Petersburg International Economic Forum was held on June 18\u201320, 1997 under the auspices of the Council of the Federation, the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the CIS and with the support of the Russian government. The Forum welcomed more than 1,500 attendees from 50 countries. The Russian and Belarusian governments signed credit agreements worth RUB 500 billion. The St. Petersburg Economic Forum International Foundation was formed in 1998 in St. Petersburg, with Herman Gref, then the Vice-Governor of St. Petersburg, and chairman of its Municipal Property Management Committee, appointed in charge of its activities. An investment contribution was also provided by Leningrad Region. The grounds for the allocation were outlined in a decree from the Governor of Leningrad Region: In 1999, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree giving the go-ahead to the economic forum in St. Petersburg, and recommended that the St. Petersburg Economic Forum International Foundation be allocated the required funding and be offered support in organizing the event. Furthermore, it was also recommended that the Russian government provide possible financing and organizational support to the Council of the Federation and the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the CIS. Information regarding the long-term role of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum International Foundation in the organization and running of the forum in St. Petersburg has not been made publicly available. Until 2004, the SPIEF Organizing Committee consisted of the Council of the Federation and the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the CIS. In 2004 the Chairman of the Council of the Federation Sergei Mironov and the Minister of Economic Development and Trade of Russia Herman Gref joined the Organizing Committee, the former as chairman and the latter as Co-chairman. In 2005, President of Russia Vladimir Putin took part in the Forum for the first time. Through his participation, the forum attained the informal status of a \"presidential\" event. In 2006 the President of Russia announced his support for the proposal of the Russian government to hold an annual economic forum in St. Petersburg. Responsibility for the organization of the forum was given to the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which built on the experiences of the Council of the Federation and the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the CIS. Under the auspices of the ministry, the current format of SPIEF is more of a successor to its previous incarnation than its continuation. Based on the decision of the Russian President, significant changes were made to the Organizing Committee, with the then Minister of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation Herman Gref appointed its chairman. Sergei Mironov was made Co-chairman of the Organizing Committee, which he held until his departure from the Council of the Federation in mid-2011. The Forum was then restructured under the auspices of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development. Since 2006, SPIEF had been held at the Lenexpo Exhibition Complex, situated on Vasilievsky Island in St. Petersburg. Prior to this, the Forum was held at the Tauride Palace, the headquarters of the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the CIS. The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum Foundation was established in March 2007 to deal with the organizational and technical aspects of running the forum. Anton Troyanov was appointed Director of the Foundation. The first Forum in the updated format was held in 2007, organized by the SPIEF Foundation under the leadership of the Organizing Committee. The same year a partnership between the World Economic Forum (WEF) and SPIEF was announced. On January 25, 2007, St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and World Economic Forum representatives met in Davos to sign a Memorandum of Cooperation between the WEF and the SPIEF.[7] In 2007, Herman Gref left his post at the Russian Ministry of Economic Development to take a position at Sberbank of Russia. As a result, the Organizing Committee became headed by Elvira Nabiullina, who was appointed to the post of Minister of Economic Development that same year. On January 22, 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree to form a new SPIEF Organizing Committee and approved its provisions. At the same time, the Russian government was instructed to set aside a budget to finance the preparation and running of the Forum. The Forum's provisions dictate that the Organizing Committee be chaired by the Minister, i.e., the role of chairing the committee falls under the purview of the minister, who in turn approves the members of the organizing committee. Herman Gref was appointed Co-Chair of the new Organizing Committee. Since 2008, Sberbank of Russia has remained the Forum's largest sponsor (general partner).[8] Between 2008 and 2011, the Forum was held with the participation of Dmitry Medvedev in his capacity as President of Russia. At that time, Vladimir Putin served as Prime Minister. During one government meeting, Prime Minister Putin expressed disappointment at his colleagues who took part in the Forum. According to media reports, after the 2008 Forum, during a government Presidium meeting, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Igor Shuvalov, whose address at SPIEF had resonated greatly with investors, received a verbal admonishment from Vladimir Putin. At the same time, Vladimir Putin's comment came following a statement by Minister of Agriculture Alexey Gordeyev, and was not addressed directly to one particular person. In April 2009, Alexander Stuglev was appointed Director of the SPIEF Foundation, replacing Anton Troyanov. Alexander Stuglev's post also means he is automatically included in the Organizing Committee. In the same year, St. Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko signed a resolution \"On conducting the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum\", which specified the main points of cooperation between the city, the Forum Organizing Committee, and the SPIEF Foundation, and established the Coordination Committee. In May 2012, the post of Chair of the SPIEF Organizing Committee went to the new Minister of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, Andrey Belousov. In 2012, SPIEF was held on June 21\u201323. The structure of the programme was built on four pillars: \"Securing the Future\", \"Realizing Russia\u2019s Potential\", \"Responding to Impact Technologies\", and \"Conversations to Make a Difference\". As in previous years, the Forum was attended by the President of Russia. After a four-year hiatus, SPIEF once again welcomed Vladimir Putin, who was elected President the same year. The plenary session was also attended by President of Finland Sauli Niinistö. President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari was also expected to attend, but cancelled his trip just one day earlier (on June 20) due to domestic problems when the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the Prime Minister was occupying his post illegally. In June 2013, the post of Chair of the Organizing Committee went to new Minister of Economic Development of Russia Alexey Ulyukaev. However, organization of the Forum and development of its business programme were overseen by Deputy Minister Sergey Belyakov. In 2014, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum found itself at the centre of controversy over the political crisis in Ukraine. Due to diplomatic tensions between Russia and a number of Western nations, heads of major corporations based in the US, Europe, and other regions declined to participate in the Forum. Speaking to reporters, an official White House representative confirmed that their administration had discussed the possibility of declining invitations to SPIEF with US business executives. Executives who declined to attend the Forum included heads of Boeing, International Paper, Goldman Sachs, ConocoPhillips, Siemens, and others. The Forum's organizers maintained that this absence of several multinational corporations played no role in shaping the event's official programme. In 2014, Sergey Belyakov was fired from his government post. In September of the same year, he was appointed chairman of the board of the SPIEF Foundation. In November 2014, Minister Ulyukaev left the post of Chair of the Organizing Committee. In his place, the President of Russia appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Prikhodko. Since that time, the Forum has been organized directly by the Russian government administration, rather than the Ministry of Economic Development. On December 4, 2015, the SPIEF Foundation was renamed to the Roscongress Foundation.[9] The Forum was held on June 18\u201320, 1997 under the auspices of the Inter-parliamentary Assembly of CIS Member States and with the support of the Russian government. It was attended by more than 1,500 people from 50 countries. During the Forum, the governments of Russia and Belarus signed loan agreements totaling 500 billion roubles. The Forum was held on June 17\u201319, 1998 under the auspices of the Inter-parliamentary Assembly of CIS Member States and the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. The Forum, held as an annual event for the first time, was attended by some 2,600 people, including leaders of CIS member-states, and representatives of 36 major international organizations, including the Council of Europe, the United Nations, and UNESCO. In addition, the Forum was attended by prominent Russian scholars, as well as heads of Russian and international private financial institutions. During the Forum, 700 investment projects were agreed on, and 52 agreements and protocols on investments totaling approximately US$1 billion were signed.

Among the most memorable events of the Forum was the exhibition on Regional Markets of Russia and CIS countries, and the presentation of the Greater Volga and Siberian Agreement inter-regional associations for economic interaction between federal subjects of the RF.

During the Forum, a Moscow-Paris teleconference dedicated to a number of social and economic problems was organized, which was attended by members of the Federation Council of Russia, and French senators, as well as prominent thought leaders and public figures of the two countries. The Forum was held on June 12\u201316, 2001 under the motto \"The XXI Century: Innovative Development for the Benefit of Humanity\". By 2001, the Forum's status had grown significantly. It was officially recognized as the primary economic conference for the CIS. The presidents of Russia and Belarus, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan sent letters of welcome to Forum participants. The Forum was attended by Czech Prime Minister Miloš Zeman and Chairman of the Parliament of Romania Nicolae Vacaroiu. In addition, representatives of the IMF and IBRD were in attendance.

The Forum was held on June 8\u201310, 2007. The Forum was a cooperation between two venues \u2013 the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and the World Economic Forum in Davos.

One of the days of the St. Petersburg Forum was dedicated to the analysis of Russia's economy and its development trends up to 2020. In his speech, First Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov suggested that by 2020 Russia would become one of the five largest economies in the world. The distinctive feature of the XI Forum was its practical orientation. Exhibitions were among the main events of SPIEF and illustrated the high economic and innovative potential of Russia's regions. The Forum was held on June 6\u20138, 2008. The emergence of new centers of economic growth resulted in changes in the structure and development trends of global commodity and financial markets. The global financial crisis and problems associated with the dollar's decline, the emergence of sovereign investment funds, and a rise in energy and food prices are individual manifestations of such processes. The problem of climate change can be added to the list, the solution of which requires not just individual, but collective efforts on the part of the majority of the world's nations. The existing institutions of global economic management had been shaped in a different era, and now they do not fulfill their purpose of preventing recessionary trends and diminishing their negative effects, both for individual countries and the entire global economy. In such conditions, many nations act individually in order to protect their national interests. Such uncoordinated actions may cause the unjustified rise of protectionism. Fundamental reform of institutions and principles of global governance is essential for a more accurate reckoning of both national and global interests. The 2009 St. Petersburg International Economic Forum was dedicated to pressing issues of the current stage of world development. As the crisis had shown, in recent years the economies of the countries of the world had not become less (as was believed a year beforehand) but more dependent on each other; however, the crisis revealed itself in different ways in various regions of the world. On the other hand, it had now become obvious that national and international institutions formed in the post-war period were inadequate for the level of development of the global economy and the financial system, and could not allow the necessary level of trust in the economic system to be maintained. The ongoing global economic crisis had confirmed the need to abandon standard approaches and required collective, nontrivial solutions to be adopted. Forum participants discussed new approaches to understanding the future of international financial institutions, the prospects for development of the banking sector, the efficiency of measures taken by governments and other equally important issues. Special attention was paid to Russia's role in solving these problems. The Forum was attended by representatives of the world political and business elite, and leading economists and experts. What were the peculiarities of the situation in the economies and banking systems in various regions of the world? What measures should have been taken at national and supranational levels to alter the situation? What was the role of the banking sector and state policy in this sector? Was it enough to reform only the financial system, or were wider structural changes needed? These and many other questions were specifically discussed by Forum participants. The centuries-long history of the world had demonstrated many examples of struggle with economic crises and the methods of overcoming them. 2,514 people attended the official Forum program, including: \u2022 5 Heads of States and Governments (Presidents of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Finland, and the Philippines, and the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina); \u2022 35 Vice Prime Ministers and Ministers of foreign countries; \u2022 56 Ambassadors; and \u2022 54 representatives of international organizations. Altogether there were 271 members of official delegations from 73 countries. \u2022 693 representatives of foreign business from 83 countries, including sponsor and partner representatives; and \u2022 802 representatives of Russian business, including sponsor and partner representatives.

The XV St Petersburg International Economic Forum was convened on June 16\u201318, 2011 under the theme \u2018Emerging Leadership for a New Era\u2019. The Forum was attended by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and five foreign government leaders: Prime Minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, President of the People's Republic of China Hu Jintao, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Finland Tarja Halonen, and President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa. The discussions at the Forum were built around three interrelated pillars: 'Securing Global Growth', 'Building Russia's Creative Capital' and 'Expanding Technology Horizons'. At the opening plenary the participants of the Forum were addressed by President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev and President of the People's Republic of China Hu Jintao. The programme of the Forum included the traditional gathering of CEOs of global energy companies at the energy session entitled 'New Paths to Energy Security'. The Forum continued cooperation with international television companies. SPIEF 2011 hosted three television debates organised jointly with CNBC, BBC and Bloomberg. The Forum continued a series of briefings under the theme 'Doing Business in Russia', which gave participants a chance to acquire firsthand information on legislative initiatives aimed at improving opportunities to do business in Russia as well as pose questions to the key newsmakers who shape the business and investment climate in the country.

Its participants were confirmed by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. Later changes to the Organizing Committee were made as a result of the changing roles of the participants. The Organizing Committee traditionally consists of representatives of the various ministries, agencies and organizations involved in the organization of SPIEF (for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for visa support, the FSO for security provision etc.) or those that have participated in the foundation and development of the Forum, as well as the Directors of SPIEF. Committee meetings are not held to a regular schedule, they happen 2\u20133 times during the preparation period of a particular Forum. The Organizing Committee approves key decisions that will later be executed by the agencies and the SPIEF Foundation. Initially, the Chairperson of the Organizing Committee was the Minister of Economic Development (according to position); however, the President of the Russian Federation signed two decrees regarding the organizing committee in November 2014. From this point onwards the Chairperson of the Organizing Committee is appointed by the President of the Russian Federation, and first to be appointed was the Vice President \u2013 Sergey Prikhodko, the Government Chief of Staff. The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum Foundation (abbreviated to SPIEF) was founded in March 2007 for the purpose of organizing and running the Forum. There is no publicly available information regarding the link between the SPIEF Foundation and the St. Petersburg Economic Forum International Foundation, which was founded in 1998. The official objectives of the Foundation are: Anton Troyanov was the first person to serve as Director of the SPIEF Foundation. In April 2009, he was replaced by Alexander Stuglev, who had previously served as Deputy Director in charge of delegate relations. Prior to 2011, SPIEF Foundation headquarters were located in Pavilion 9 of the Lenexpo Exhibition Complex, inside the Marine Fleet Research and Development Institute building. In 2011, Pavilion 9 closed all but a handful of services located on the first floor, while the Foundation's core team moved to a new home at the Baltis Plaza Business Centre, located on Vasilievsky Island not far from Lenexpo. During the Forum, Pavilion 9 serves as the SPIEF operations centre. The Foundation is structured to include all the offices needed to organize events: accreditation, technical support, financial, legal, short-term employment, etc. As a result, the Foundation has branched out to organize other events not related to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. In 2011, the SPIEF Foundation was named sole state contractor for a wide range of services related to organizing and conducting events around Russia's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation chairmanship, with the exception of the summit held as part of the Forum. On December 4, 2015, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum Foundation was renamed the Roscongress Foundation.[26] Since 2006, the Forum has been held at the Lenexpo Exhibition Complex, located on Vasilievsky Island in St. Petersburg (latitude 9°55\u203250\u2033 north, longitude 30°14\u203200\u2033 east). In 2007, a few months before the 11th SPIEF, Lenexpo unveiled the new Pavilion 8A, which would go on to host the Forum's plenary sessions. Most of the Forum's indoor and outdoor facilities are temporary structures which are dismantled once the event is over. SPIEF facilities at Lenexpo, since 2007: Temporary partner pavilions located in the open-air sections of Lenexpo host various events, including presentations and cultural events. In 2016 SPIEF will take place at a new venue \u2013 the ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Centre, located in Pulkovo Heights. Each year since 2007, the Forum's partners have included a major global auto manufacturer, which donates over 200 new executive-class cars for SPIEF participants. As a rule, these cars bear the Forum logo. Once the Forum is over, distributors sell these cars at a discount. Official SPIEF cars: In 2007, the organizers began to pay closer attention to the non-business part of the programme: cultural events taking place under the auspices of the forum. Some sources have suggested the cultural programme was initially developed for people accompanying forum participants (primarily spouses) who did not attend roundtables. Eventually, however, cultural events were incorporated into the main SPIEF programme. The majority of events on the SPIEF cultural programme are open only to Forum participants. Since the programme varies each year, many events are offered only once, with the notable exception of traditional private official receptions hosted by the Governor and the Organizing Committee. At the same time, in 2007 the Forum launched what would become traditional annual open-air concerts on Palace Square in St. Petersburg, performed by some of the world's most famous artists and designed to highlight SPIEF's social significance. Concerts held on Palace Square as part of SPIEF: In 2014, Palace Square did not host a concert dedicated to the Forum. Instead, the Ice Palace hosted a SPIEF benefit showcase of international figure skating stars and medallists of the Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2015, the Forum also did not include a free concert for city residents.","Title":"St. Petersburg International Economic Forum - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15935","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum"}
