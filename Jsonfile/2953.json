According to Cohn, \"Doctors told me I was the luckiest unlucky guy they had met in a long, long time.\"[23] A police spokesperson surmised that the car's windshield may have significantly impeded the bullet's force, and added: \"Frankly, I can't tell you how he survived.\"[37] The shooter was sentenced to 36 years in prison.[35]","Title":"Marc Cohn - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2953","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cohn"}
