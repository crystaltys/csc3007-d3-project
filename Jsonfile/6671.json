{"Content: ":"Cocoon was a techno club in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It had a space for 1,500 visitors. It consisted of two restaurants, multiple lounge spaces, bars and little private and public cocoons made out of sofas which were placed inside the walls. The club was unique by architecture and design also by the dancing floors. It was closed on 30 November 2012. It was replaced by the club moon13 on the same location but under a different management. Cocoon was opened on 18 July 2004 inside a newly built concrete office building, named U.F.O. (Unbekannter Frankfurter Osten)[1] constructed by Dietz Joppien Architekten in the industrial east of Frankfurt. It was the successor of the Omen club. The designer of the club interior was the company 3deluxe from Wiesbaden. It was an investment of several million Euros (10 million just for the design by the company 3deluxe). The sound system by Steve Dash cost 700.000 Euros.[2]","Title":"Cocoon (club) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6671","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoon_(club)"}
