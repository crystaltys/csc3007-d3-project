{"Content: ":"The Billboard Global 200 is a weekly record chart published by Billboard magazine. The chart ranks the top songs globally and is based on digital sales and online streaming from over 200 territories worldwide. First announced in mid-2019, it officially launched in September 2020. The first number-one song for the chart dated September 19, 2020, was \"WAP\" by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion.[1] The current number-one as of the chart dated July 30, 2022, is \"Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52\" by Bizarrap and Quevedo.[2] Billboard had been working on the idea of a global chart for over two years prior to its launch.[3] The chart was first announced on May 6, 2019, then envisioned as the \"Global 100\" and it was to launch later that year.[4] The motivation for the chart's conception was \"to expose people to music from multiple territories and in time\", to provide \"overdue exposure and recognition for acts from international markets\". With the chart's official announcement on September 14, 2020, Billboard described it as \"the first authoritative charts ranking the top songs globally\", and stated that basing the chart on worldwide streams and download sales, \"will give an accurate glimpse into the most popular songs on the planet\".[3] Establishing a global chart was dependent on the availability of the data, as well as having the various streaming and digital retail services \"willing to participate and provide data\"; Billboard considered this \"not an easy task\" and the reason why it took so long to launch a global chart.[5] \"As the steward of the definitive industry charts, we're thrilled to unveil out our global charts which give the industry insights into the most powerful artists worldwide, what songs have an international impact, as well as what songs may start trending outside of the United States\". \u2013 MRC Data and MRC Media & Info president Deanna Brown.[3] The chart officially premiered on Billboard's website on September 15, 2020, for the chart week dated September 19, 2020.[1] The first number-one song on the chart was \"WAP\" by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion.[1] The chart methodology includes sales and streaming data from more than 200 territories. Positions are measured on a weighted formula which incorporates official streams from both subscription and ad-supported levels of top digital platforms, including both audio and video music services, and download sales from top music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded.[6] Streams are \"weighted\" through paid subscriptions holding more weight than streams from free subscriptions.[7] On the question about the increasing prevalence of fake streams that call into question whether consumers can trust the information on music streaming platforms, Billboard explained that they \"have worked closely with our data providers to implement various audit guidelines to limit any significant effect of manufactured streams. In addition, each data provider has their own safeguards in place to recognize fraudulent behavior and catch it before it gets to their data partners, including Billboard and MRC Data\".[5] Unlike the US-based Billboard Hot 100, the Global 200 does not have a \"recurrent\" rule, therefore allowing songs from any period in music history to chart. The recurrent rule on the Hot 100 indicates that descending songs are removed once they fall below number 25 after 52 weeks, or once below number 50 after 20 weeks.[8] The chart does not factor in any form of radio airplay, as, according to MRC Data, \"The focus was on metrics that could be systematically measured in each country\", considering how \"unlike streaming and download sales, radio is not reliably measured at this time [2020] in many territories and, even if tracked, is not done consistently from country to country\".[7] As such, the chart has been noted for being similar to the Rolling Stone Top 100, which, although it is a US song chart, also only incorporates sales and streams in their chart formula.[7][dubious \u2013 discuss] The chart follows a \"unique, revenue-reflective\" methodology reflecting the global market. The official chart methodology is as follows: Each ranking is based on stream equivalent units using the following formula: (Tracks * 200) + premium streams + (ad-supported streams / 4.5)[5] The chart follows a Friday\u2013Thursday tracking week.[3] It is compiled by MRC Data/Nielsen Music through their Music Connect product, a recently launched music measurement and analytics platform, and is published every Tuesday on Billboard.com.[1][9] Along with the Global 200, Billboard launched another, similar chart: the Billboard Global Excl. US chart. This chart follows the same formula as the Global 200, except, as the name suggests, it covers all territories excluding the US.[3] Billboard stated their reasoning for having two charts: \"One of the goals for this project was to expose people to music from multiple territories. So having each chart go 200 titles deep and also presenting a view of titles excluding U.S. influence was of great importance to us\".[5] The first number-one song for the chart dated September 19, 2020, was \"Haw√°i\" by Maluma.[1]","Title":"Billboard Global 200 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2813","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Global_200"}
