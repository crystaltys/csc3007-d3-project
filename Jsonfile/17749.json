His compositions focus on choral music with and without accompaniment, but he also wrote symphonies, chamber music and stage works. Koerppen was born in Wiesbaden on 16 December 1926.[1][2] His father, August Koerppen, was a conductor, so he became familiar with music early. He received his first music lessons at the age of six. While still at school, he wrote his own compositions. He attended the Musisches Gymnasium Frankfurt for especially musically gifted children from all over Germany, from 1939 to 1945; he was trained in composition and music theory by Kurt Thomas.[1][2] He studied at the same time as Heinz Hennig, Paul Kuhn, Clytus Gottwald and Siegfried Strohbach.[3] After World War II, Koerppen initially worked as an organist and music teacher at the Musisches Gymnasium.[4][2] In 1946, his first works were published and he received commissions for compositions.
