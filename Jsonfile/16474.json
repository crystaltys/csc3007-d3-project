It will not be the way it was with Abkhazia: the folks on the Maidan have been hardened and know what they are fighting for \u2013 for their country, their independence.

But it's up to them how they want to live\".[13] The Professor of the Department of Philosophy at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Andrey Zubov was fired for his article in Vedomosti, criticizing Russian military intervention.[14] On 2 March, one Moscow resident protested against Russian intervention by holding \"Stop the war\" banner, but he was immediately harassed by passers-by and when the police was arresting him, a woman offered to fabricate a serious charge (beating up a child) against him; however, the proposal was rejected by the police.[15] Andrei Zubov, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, who compared Russian actions in Crimea to the Anschluss of Austria, was threatened.
