National Selection), informally known as Vidbir, is a Ukrainian musical competition originally organized by the public broadcaster Suspilne and STB, which determines the Ukrainian representative at the Eurovision Song Contest. In late August 2021, it was announced that the two broadcasters had terminated their partnership, and that Suspilne was looking for a new selection format for the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, thus bringing an end to the original concept for Vidbir.[1] In October 2021, Suspilne announced that the 2022 edition of Vidbir would be organized by them alone under a new format.[2] In the first year of the show, the local record by SMS voting was set by receiving 344,268 unique votes, 37.77% of which supported Jamala,[3] who eventually became the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016.
