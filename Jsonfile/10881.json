Suriname is a former colony of the Netherlands and shares Dutch as the official language, therefore there are always a large amount people going back and forth between the countries. Initially some repatriation flights were allowed including flights to the Netherlands, but the level of infections aboard and the identification of two cases on a flight from Aruba [27] resulted in concern. On 3 April, a group of Dutch people in Suriname were scheduled to be repatriated,[116] but there was an issue with the plane which resulted it in arriving a day late. They have been housed in two hotels where they had been quarantined, because Dutch citizens from Guyana were on the same flight.[117] A second plane had repatriated them on 5 April.[118] On 7 April, Danielle Veira announced that the repatriation of Surinamese people abroad was postponed for the time being. It was also announced that home quarantine would not be allowed anymore, because of some people kept leaving their house despite being quarantined.[113][119] As of 9 April, there were 893 stranded people of which 603 were in the Netherlands and 88 in the United States.[120] A total 513 people from abroad in Suriname had been repatriated.[121] On 14 April, Danielle Veira contacted Irene Lalji, a lawyer representing a hundred stranded citizens in the Netherlands, to inform her that they were preparing to schedule a first flight for repatriation that week, and increasing the capacity for quarantine.[122] On 15 April, a group of over Trinidadian 40 people within the country were reported to be in a \"desperate\" situation. 33 people of the group had been hired by Staatsolie, the national oil company.

Those still stranded would have to contact the embassy. As of 15 May, there would be no more repatriation flights for the time being, which has also been due to the fact that there were 576 people in quarantine.[114] Suriname is bordered with French Guiana by the Marowijne river. There is no bridge between the two countries and border traffic has to use the ferry between Albina and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni.[134] On 11 April, Suriname and France announced joint efforts to prevent illegal crossings of the Marowijne,[135] and established a contact point in Albina and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni.[136] On 13 April, the Prefect of French-Guinea mobilized the army to guard the river for its entire length.[137] On 15 April, John Samuel, Chair of the political party De Nieuwe Wind and former consul to French Guinea, had been sent back when he tried to illegally cross the river to visit his family.[138] A total lockdown of the rivers on the eastern border was instituted from 30 April, and concerns the Marowijne, Lawa and Tapanahony river. Essential traffic would be allowed,[139] however people who illegally crossed the rivers would have to quarantine for 14 days.[52] As of 2 May, the use of skalians (gold dredges) on the rivers are forbidden. French Guiana had previously complained about the increase of \u2013 often illegal \u2013 gold prospectors.[140] Suriname is bordered with Guyana by the Courantyne river, and border traffic has to use the Canawaima ferry between Nieuw Nickerie and Corriverton, Guyana.[134] A bridge between Apoera and Orealla in Guyana is still being planned.[141] On 21 April, Suriname and Guyana have agreed to allow legitimate trade over the Courantyne river, because the closure had resulted in food and fuel shortage in the Amerindian villages, Orealla and Siparuta.[142] The border will remain closed for people.[143] Suriname's border with Brazil has been established by the Treaty of Limits[144] and mainly consists of impenetrable rainforest, and can be accessed through maroon and indigenous areas some of which are de jure autonomous like the Ndyuka.[145] The discovery of gold has led to illegal border crossings and the establishment of villages in the border area.[146] The international drugs trade also exploits the backdoor.[147] As of 17 April, there had only been one death reported in the Suriname, but there had been several COVID-19 related deaths of notable people abroad who either had a Surinamese nationality or a strong connection to Suriname.

In cooperation with the Pan American Health Organization the Central Laboratory (Bureau voor Openbare Gezondheidszorg \u2013 B.O.G.) started to develop a test system for the virus which was completed on 5 February,[154] and train healthcare workers.[155] Tests were also being carried out at the Medical Microbiological Laboratory of the Academic Hospital Paramaribo.[156] In March 2020 the council of ministers appointed a COVID-19 management team under the lead of the director of the Ministry of Public Health Cleopatra Jessurun and further consisted of: Ministry of Education, Science and Culture; Ministry of Trade and Industry; Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications; Ministry of Defence; Ministry of Justice and Police; Ministry of Regional Development; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Housing; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Agriculture, Husbandry and Fisheries; and To effectively manage the spread of the COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2) and minimize the negative effects of the crisis on Public Health, Security and Economy, the government of Suriname made use of the Grondwet ('Constitution') article 72c to announce a Civil Exceptional Status and passed the Law 'Exceptional Condition' COVID-19 in Parliament.[157] Article 2 of the Law allowed for the establishment of a COVID-19 Crisis Management Team led by the Vice President of Suriname, Ashwin Adhin, and consisting of minimally the following members appointed by the President of Suriname Desi D. Bouterse:[158] The Law 'Exceptional Condition' also enabled the establishment of a Parliamentary Crisis Commission with Jennifer Simons[160] as appointed head. The commission was to be informed of the measures the government took to manage the crisis and has the power to make binding decisions through Parliament on these measures with regard to compliance with the Law 'Exceptional Condition'.[161] The Law had been extended by one month as of 10 July 2020. Ashwin Adhin was replaced by Ronnie Brunswijk.[162] After the general Surinamese 2020 election, the COVID-19 management team was replaced on 16 July 2020.[163] Danielle Veira and Jerry Slijngard retired and COVID-19 would no longer be managed by the Directorate National Security.[164] Amar Ramadhin, Minister of Health, became the new Director of the COVID-19 management team. Ronnie Brunswijk was placed in charged of the Parliamentary team. The medical team is headed by Marthelise Eersel, a former of Director Public Health. The medical specialists remain in the team.[165] Notes: Suriname is receives its vaccins from the COVAX system, that has made a selection for Suriname for the AstraZeneca vaccine.[168] In March 2021 Suriname received 50.000 vaccines from India as a friendly gesture.[169] In the midst of April the number of vaccines run out,[170] and at the beginning of May Suriname requested the Netherlands for help.[171] On 15 May 2021, the Netherlands replied to donate 700.000 COVID-19 vaccines to Suriname.
