This is part of a wide effort by the European Investment Bank to address the health and economic impact of COVID-19.[10][11][12] Meanwhile, BioNTech and the European Union are collaborating to assess mRNA vaccine production facilities in Rwanda and Senegal.[13][14][15][16] In seven African countries (Botswana, Cape Verde, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tunisia) the entire targeted population had been fully vaccinated by the end of 2021.

In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson, which held trials for its Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States, but 57% in South Africa.[170] On 6 February 2021, The Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine against the 501.V2 variant. The study found that in a sample size of 2,000 the AZD1222 vaccine afforded only \"minimal protection\" in all but the most severe cases of COVID-19.[171] On 7 February 2021, the Minister for Health for South Africa suspended the planned deployment of around 1 million doses of the vaccine whilst they examine the data and await advice on how to proceed.[172] In February, Moderna reported that the current vaccine produced only one-sixth of the antibodies in response to the South African variant compared with the original virus. They have launched a trial of a new vaccine to tackle the South African 501.V2 variant.[173] On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two thirds for the 501.V2 variant, while stating no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made.[174] Media related to COVID-19 vaccination in Africa at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"COVID-19 vaccination in Africa - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11195","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Africa"}
