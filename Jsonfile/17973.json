{"Content: ":"Death Carries a Cane (Italian title: Passi di danza su una lama di rasoio/ Dance Steps on the Edge of a Razor),[2] is a 1973 Italian giallo film directed by Maurizio Pradeaux.[3] It starred Robert Hoffmann, Nieves Navarro and Luciano Rossi.[4] The film was later released on video as The Tormentor, Maniac at Large, The Night of the Rolling Heads and Devil Blade.[2] (Pradeaux went on to direct another giallo, the 1977 Death Steps in the Dark.)[5] Kitty (Susan Scott) is waiting for her boyfriend Alberto (Robert Hoffmann) when she witnesses a murder through a coin-operated telescope. The woman is slashed to death by a black clad killer who carries a cane and limps. The police don't believe her at first, but later the corpse is discovered in the park. A peanut vendor who works in the area is next to die, followed by a string of brutal murders (a cleaning lady, a dancer, etc.). Alberto at one point becomes a suspect, as he carries a cane and has a limp. Some amateur sleuths decide to solve the murders and focus their attention on a nearby dance academy. AllMovie wrote of the film, \"a complex plot and stylish visuals don't necessarily combine to instantly produce a good giallo\", but that \"the film is good for a few chuckles and has a pair of memorable murder sequences.\"[6]  This article related to an Italian film of the 1970s is a stub.
