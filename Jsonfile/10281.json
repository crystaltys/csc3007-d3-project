{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Uganda in March 2020.[2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] Model-based simulations for Uganda suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t has been lower than 1.0 since July 2021.[8] A 2021 study found that the Uganda government used the COVID-19 pandemic to increase repression of opposition areas in Uganda.[9] Note:  As a precautionary measure, on 18 March 2020, President Yoweri Museveni banned all incoming and outgoing travel to specified highly affected counties for a period of 32 days.[85] Schools were closed and public gatherings banned.[86] The president extended the lock down period for another 21 days on top of the 14 days. This lock down period continued from 15 April and run up to 5 May 2020.[87] He made the announcement while addressing the nation on the status of coronavirus pandemic in Uganda.[88] Up until 5 May 2020, most businesses had to remain closed. Food markets remained open, but many vendors were unable to return home and had to sleep in markets due to the suspension of public transport.[89] A small number of businesses such as factories, garages, hardware shops, metalworks and restaurants for takeaway were allowed to reopen on 5 May,[90][91] while others such as hair salons and business arcades remained closed until 27 July.[92] Due to the high level of informality in Uganda's economy, it is not yet possible to assess the full magnitude of the economic impact of the lockdown, but the consequences for incomes and poverty are likely severe. Research results from July 2020 show that many informal entrepreneurs in Kampala had no income at all during the lockdown, and hence had to dip into their own savings, rely on government food support, or ask for help from family or friends to survive.[91] A number of Ugandan musicians have released songs with messages to the people about the prevention of the virus, including Bobi Wine, Bebe Cool, and Joanita Kawalya.[93]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10281","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Uganda"}
