R. Jayewardene in 1984 after publicly criticizing a conference called by Jayewardene to redress grievances of the Tamil minority.[8] Jayewardene's successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, subsequently reinstated Mathew's party membership. He died of a heart attack on 17 October 1989. Mathew was the author of the book Sinhalese! Rise to Protect Buddhism, which urged Sinhalese to stand up for their rights and protect their values.
