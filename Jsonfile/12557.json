{"Content: ":"The Association of Academies of the Spanish Language (Spanish: Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española, ASALE) is an entity whose end is to work for the unity, integrity, and growth of the Spanish language.[2] It was created in Mexico in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. The association publishes reference works on the Spanish language and commemorative editions of Hispanic literature, among other publications.[3][4][5][6] Through the initiative of then-president of Mexico Miguel Alemán Valdés, the first congress of academies convened with the purpose of maintaining the integrity of and fostering the further growth of Spanish.[4] The meeting was held from 23 April to 6 May 1951 and resulted in the creation of the association[7] and its permanent commission.[8] The Royal Spanish Academy (Spanish: Real Academia Española or RAE) was not present at the initial meeting but participated in the permanent commission.[9] Ever since the second congress convened in 1956, the RAE has been a regular participant.[citation needed] In 2000 the association organised the School of Hispanic Lexicography and the Carolina Foundation to promote Spanish lexicography[citation needed], and together with the RAE, the association earned the Prince of Asturias Award for peace.[10] An academy for Equatorial Guinea was created in 2013 and joined the association in 2016.[11] The collaboration between RAE and the other academies was expressed in the coauthorship, since the 22nd edition published in 2001, of the Dictionary of the Spanish Language (Spanish: Diccionario de la Lengua Española), and the 1999 edition of the Orthography (Spanish: Ortografía) was considered a true pan-Hispanic work. Joint projects include the editing of the Grammar (Spanish: Gramática) and the compilation of the Dictionary of Americanisms (Spanish: Diccionario de americanismos).[citation needed] The association convenes every four years, led by a Permanent Commission composed of a President (position held by the Director of the Spanish Royal Academy), a Secretary General (one of the directors of the other academies), a Treasurer (chosen by the Spanish Royal Academy), and at least two board members drawn from the associated academies, whose nomination rotate annually.[3][12][13] During the Third Congress of Academies, held in Bogotá, Colombia, in 1960, an agreement was reached whereby the governments of countries with a member in the association would be obliged to provide financial support to their respective academies and the greater association.[14] Although Israelis mainly speak Hebrew, Arabic, English, and Russian, an ASALE conference on Judaeo-Spanish held in 2015[15] led to plans for the creation of an Israeli branch.[16] A group of academics was founded by ASALE in 2018 and submitted to the government of Israel for recognition. The National Academia of Judaeo-Spanish in Israel will then have the ability to petition to join as a full member, likely in 2019.[17][needs update] There are no plans for Belize, Gibraltar, or Andorra to have their own academies, despite each having a majority Spanish-speaking population either as a first or second language. There is also a substantial Spanish population in Brazil and Western Sahara.[citation needed]","Title":"Association of Academies of the Spanish Language - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12557","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Academies_of_the_Spanish_Language"}
