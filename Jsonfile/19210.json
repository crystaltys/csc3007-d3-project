{"Content: ":"The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe (Dakota: Wakpa Ipakṡaƞ oyáte[1]) are a federally recognized tribe of Santee Dakota people. Their reservation is the Flandreau Indian Reservation. The tribe are members of the Mdewakantonwan people, one of the sub-tribes of the Isanti (Santee) Dakota originally from central Minnesota. In 1934, the Tribe was recognized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. Today the Flandreau Santee Sioux Reservation is located on 2,500 acres (10 km2) of land in South Dakota. Notable tribal member Chief Little Crow participated in the Dakota War of 1862. In mid-2015, the Tribe stated their intent to begin growing cannabis on one authorized site on their reservation, and commence selling the product on 1 January 2016, following a vote of tribal authorities which decided 5\u20131 to legalize cannabis.[2]","Title":"Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19210","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flandreau_Santee_Sioux_Tribe"}
