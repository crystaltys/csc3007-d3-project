{"Content: ":"Opernwelt (Opera World) is a monthly German magazine for opera, operetta and ballet. It includes news about current performances, portraits of composers and performers, articles about opera houses, performance spaces, and contemporary and historical subjects from the world of opera and classical music. It reviews recordings and books and publishes monthly schedules of German and international opera houses. The magazine's website offers full text search for past issues. A year book is published every October. Each year since 1994, at the end of the season, the magazine sponsors a jury of 50 critics to select the best in several categories: They are usually selected from German-speaking countries, Austria, Germany and German-speaking Switzerland. In 2011, La Monnaie received the accolade, the first time it has been given to a non-German speaking house.[3] This article relating to a European magazine connected with culture is a stub.
