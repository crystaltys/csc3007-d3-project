These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008[1] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[2] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis.[3] Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number. The numbers of NRHP listings in each county are documented by tables in each of the individual county list-articles.","Title":"National Register of Historic Places listings in Delaware - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3910","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Delaware"}
