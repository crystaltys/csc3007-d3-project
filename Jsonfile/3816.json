{"Content: ":"The Daniel Webster Memorial is a monument in Washington, D.C. honoring U.S. statesman Daniel Webster. It is located near Webster's former home at 1603 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest, beside Scott Circle at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Rhode Island Avenue. The statue of Webster was given to the United States government by Stilson Hutchins, founder of The Washington Post and a fellow native of New Hampshire.[2] An Act of Congress on July 1, 1898 authorized its erection on public grounds and appropriated $4,000 for a pedestal. The memorial was dedicated on January 19, 1900.[2][3] On October 12, 2007, the Daniel Webster Memorial was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1][3] The memorial is also designated a contributing property to the Sixteenth Street Historic District in 1978.[4] The Daniel Webster Memorial consists of a 12-foot (3.7 m) bronze statue of Webster on an 18-foot (5.5 m) granite pedestal in a sober classical style. The statue was sculpted by Gaetano Trentanove.[5] On the east and west sides of the pedestal are bronze bas-relief panels illustrating events in Webster's life: the Webster\u2013Hayne debate; the dedication of the Bunker Hill Monument.[6] The inscription reads: G.
