{"Content: ":"Brabus GmbH (stylized in uppercase in its logo) is a German high-performance automotive aftermarket tuning company founded in 1977 in Bottrop (Ruhr area). Brabus specialises in Mercedes-Benz, Smart and Maybach vehicles, although in 2022 it also tuned 2 Porsches and even a Rolls-Royce. Brabus is the largest Mercedes-Benz tuner after Mercedes-AMG, which has been a Daimler AG subsidiary since the 1990s. The company began with Bodo Buschmann wanting to customise his cars, but discovered most existing customisers could not grasp his vision or meet his requirements, so he decided to start his own brand. After Buschmann had decided to start his own brand, Brabus GmbH was originally registered in 1977 in West Germany with Buschmann's friend Klaus Brackmann because German law required a company must be established with at least two people. The company name was derived from the first three characters of the founders' surnames (Brackmann, Buschmann). Following the company's foundation, Brackmann did not show interests in modifying vehicles or running a business, so he sold his company shares to Buschmann for 100 euros.[1] In 2012, Brabus had started building its third factory in Bottrop.[2] Brabus's primary focus is to achieve maximum car performance through the increase of horsepower and movement. Customers can either buy cars from Brabus, or send in their car to be customized and/or overhauled. Customers ordering a car directly involves Brabus purchasing a particular model from Mercedes and then modifying it according to the customer's requests. Brabus is known for providing expensive tuning. Brabus also offers cosmetic modifications including low profile spoilers, bodykits, carbon fiber splitters, and multi-piece alloy wheels. Other upgrades include racing LSDs, open racing exhaust systems, twelve-piston disc brakes, and engine remapping. Customers can also have complete engine overhauls, or have new crate engines from AMG modified for them. Brabus engines range from small 200 horsepower (150 kW) K4 blocks for SLK roadsters and CLK-Class to the 900 horsepower (670 kW) twin-turbo blocks for the S-Class.[3] The company also provides improvements to the interior from custom upholstery, gauges, shiftknobs, pedals, and trim to various electronics such as wider LCD screens for the Maybach. [6] The company has built special editions of Mercedes-Benz, Maybach, Rolls Royce, Porsche and Smart vehicles. The Brabus K8 performance kit for the SL model (SL55) includes modifications to the supercharger incorporating a custom vibration damper and pulley, high-performance metal catalysts, and an auxiliary circulation pump with opposing radiator. Power is increased from a standard 476 hp (355 kW) to 550 hp (410 kW) at 6,200 rpm. The maximum torque is 780 N⋅m (580 lb⋅ft) at 3,000 rpm. The roadster is claimed to reach 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.1 seconds, passes 120 mph (190 km/h) after 13.6 seconds and reaches an electronically limited top speed of 186 mph (299 km/h). Between 2006 and 2007 Brabus produced and sold 50 Smart Fortwo Edition Red cars for the UK market. All of these vehicles were originally produced with a black Tridion safety cell and black plastic panels, the car was then later repainted at Brabus in (EB6 colour code) Intense Red. The car was built with the usual Brabus additions to the exterior, these being Brabus front grill (with fog lights), Brabus front splitter, Brabus side skirts, black plastic Brabus rear exhaust panel and 16 inch Brabus Monoblock alloy wheels. These vehicles were always rumoured to be Brabus Nightrun Fortwo's that were later reworked. The interior was bespoke to this limited run of vehicles. The interior is half leather and half alcantara with red stitching. The seats use the smaller, non sport foams. This is unusual as all other Brabus 450 Fortwo's use the wider sports style seat foams. The door card inserts are alcantara with leather door pockets with the dash board finished in alcantara with an aluminium Brabus plaque displayed in the centre. None of these vehicles had heated seats or electric wing mirrors. All Brabus Edition Red Fortwo's are equipped with a 3-spoke steering wheel, bespoke floor mats, air conditioning, CD player, Brabus clock and rev counter, Brabus speedo displaying 120 mph and all of the removable interior plastics (including door handles and steering wheel trim) repainted in Intense Red to match the exterior. Designed on the base of the Fortwo Brabus, this limited edition example is powered by a 55kw 3-cylinder turbo charged engine although all of the upgraded hardware is from the 60kw motor with a different tune. Brabus upgrades over a standard 698cc Smart Fortwo include a 60kw camshaft, 60kw yellow Bosch injectors, 60kw turbo charger, 60kw turbo to intercooler pipe (TIK), Brabus branded central twin outlet exhaust with chrome tips, aluminium Brabus intake manifold name plaque and the gearbox from a Smart Roadster (different gear ratios compared with a standard Smart Fortwo). The 2012 Brabus Rocket 800 is powered by a V12 engine which provides 800 hp and 1,420Nm of torque, which has been limited to 1,100Nm. The Brabus Rocket accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph)in 3.7 seconds, 23.8 seconds to 300 km/h (186 mph) and has a top speed of 370 km/h (230 mph).","Title":"Brabus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12775","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabus"}
