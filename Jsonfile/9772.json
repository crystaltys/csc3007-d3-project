{"Content: ":"This article documents the chronology and epidemiology of the 2022 monkeypox outbreak. In the beginning of May 2022, a case of monkeypox was reported in a British resident who had travelled to Lagos and Delta State in Nigeria,[1] in areas where monkeypox is considered to be an endemic disease. The person developed a rash on 29 April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4 May,[2] and presented to hospital later the same day. Monkeypox infection was immediately suspected, and the patient was hospitalised at Guy's Hospital[2] and isolated, then tested positive for the virus on 6 May.[1] On 12 May two new cases of monkeypox were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), both in London,[3] living together in the same household, with no known link between either of them and either the index case or travel to endemic regions. One of the new cases was hospitalised at St Mary's Hospital, while the other case with milder symptoms was said to be self-isolating at home.[3] On 17 May, another four cases of monkeypox were confirmed by the UKHSA in three Londoners and a person in North East England who had previously travelled to London.[4] On 18 May in Portugal, 14 cases of monkeypox were reported by health authorities out of total of 29 suspected cases. Two samples' test results were pending.[5] In Spain, there are seven confirmed cases as of 18 May.[6] On the same day, the United States confirmed its first 2022 case of monkeypox and Canada reported 13 suspected cases.[7][8] On 19 May, Sweden and Belgium reported their first cases of monkeypox,[9][10] while Italy confirmed its first case in a traveller who had arrived from the Canary Islands.[11] A suspected case was reported in France.[12] A genomic analysis conducted on a case in Portugal places the virus infecting that patient in the West African clade, finding it most closely related to viruses associated with cases exported from Nigeria in 2018 and 2019.[13] Current sequencing error prevents exact placement of the virus within the group of these Nigerian viruses.[14] Following the detection of a case in Massachusetts the previous day, the United States on 19 May placed a $119 million order with Bavarian Nordic, with an option to buy $180 million's worth more, for up to 13 million vaccines against smallpox.[15] On 20 May, the US Department of Health and Human Services said the order was part of a standard preparedness effort and not a response to recent events. A spokesperson said, \"BARDA has worked with industry to develop and purchase vaccines and treatments for a potential smallpox emergency, some of which may also be used to respond to monkeypox.\"[16] Separately, Bavarian Nordic stated an unidentified European country had placed an order for \"Imvanex\" vaccines in response to the monkeypox outbreak.[16] On 20 May, Health Secretary of the UK Sajid Javid reported that another eleven cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the country to twenty. UKHSA reported on 27 May that a majority of cases are in men who have sex with men.[17] On 20 May, Australia reported its first suspected case, in a man who fell ill after returning from travel in the UK.[18] A second case was also confirmed on the same day. The cases were identified as being in Melbourne and Sydney. Both recently returned from travel in Europe and the UK.[19] Germany, France and the Netherlands confirmed their first cases on the same day.[20][21][22] The three confirmed cases in Belgium were linked to the Darklands fetish festival in Antwerp.[23] Also on 20 May, Belgium became the first country to introduce a mandatory quarantine for people infected with monkeypox (21 days). Close contacts of infected people do not have to self-isolate, but are told to stay vigilant.[24][25] Also on 20 May, Health Secretary of the UK Sajid Javid reported that another eleven cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the country to twenty. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UKHSA urged watchfulness among men who have sex with men, who have made up \"a notable proportion\" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe.[26] The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advised people who have had close contact with a person infected with monkeypox to self-isolate for 21 days. Self-isolation is not mandatory.[27] On 21 May, Switzerland and Israel confirmed their first cases.[28][29] Spain reported 23 new cases linked to a gay bathhouse in Madrid, bringing the country's total to 30.[30] Several infections may also be linked to the Maspalomas Gay Pride Festival in Gran Canaria.[31][32] On the same date, Norwegian authorities initiated contact tracing after a person who had visited Norway earlier in the month had tested positive back in his home country (an undisclosed European country).[33][34] A suspected case was reported in Greece, but it was later confirmed to be chickenpox.[35] On 22 May, Austria confirmed its first case.[36] On 23 May, Denmark reported its first case in a man who had returned home from the Canary Islands,[37][38] and the following day the second case was confirmed in a person that also had returned home from Spain.[39] Dr. Sue Hopkins, the chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency, announced that 37 new monkeypox cases had been confirmed, more than doubling the total confirmed in the UK to 57 cases.[40] In Canada, Quebec announced a total of 15 confirmed cases in the province.[41] On 24 May, the Czech Republic confirmed its first case, a woman who was at a music festival in Belgium at the beginning of May.[42][43][44] On the same day, United Arab Emirates reported its first case, detected in a 29-year-old female visitor from West Africa.[45] Also on that day, Slovenia confirmed its first case, a man from Canary Islands,[46] while Switzerland reported its second case, a woman in the Canton of Geneva.[47] The UK reported 14 more cases, taking the total to 71, including its first case in Scotland.[48][49] In total monkeypox has been confirmed in 19 countries.[50] On 25 May, Portugal reported an additional 10 confirmed cases.[51] The UKHSA reported 7 additional cases in England, to a total of 78 cases in the UK.[48] On 26 May, Public Health Wales and the Public Health Agency of Northern Ireland each reported one case, which, coupled with English and Scottish cases, brought the UK total to 90.[52] On the same day, Quebec reported a suspected case in a child of school age, in the Montreal area.[53] Meanwhile, in the United States, an adult woman with a recent travel history to Africa became Virginia's first monkeypox case.[54] On May 27, some countries have begun to use smallpox vaccines to protect people exposed to the monkeypox virus. 500 people in Montreal Quebec Canada received smallpox vaccinations. \"We're vaccinating in a very targeted way.
