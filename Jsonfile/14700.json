{"Content: ":"The president of Turkmenistan (Turkmen: Türkmenistanyň prezidenti), officially the president and chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan, is the head of state and head of government of Turkmenistan. The president is also the supreme commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan and heads the State Security Council. Serdar Berdimuhamedow is the current president of Turkmenistan, the third in the history of the country since it gained independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. He succeeded his father, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow when the latter stepped down in 2022 after a reign of 15 years, the first president to do so. In the 2022 election Berdimuhamedow received 72.97% of the country's popular vote against nine other candidates.[3] The country passed reforms in 2016 eliminating term limits for the presidency and removing the previous age requirement of below 70, as well as extending the term from five to seven years.[4] Requirements for candidates for president of Turkmenistan include the following:[5] The powers of the president of Turkmenistan may be terminated in accordance with article 57 of the Turkmen constitution in the event of: Should the president be removed from office, the chairman of the Assembly is legally appointed as acting president, with elections being held no later than 60 days after the fact. This has never taken place; in 2006, when Turkmenistan's only presidential vacancy occurred due to Niyazov's death in office, the State Security Council of Turkmenistan transferred the right to act as President to the first deputy chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers on an ad-hoc basis. The requirement that an acting president does not have the right to run for president was also dropped. The Oguzkhan Presidential Palace is the principal residence/workplace of the president, located on Independence Square in Ashgabat. The various halls of the palace are used to receive foreign leaders and sign presidential decrees. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov owned a private residence in an official residence in Arshabil, a town 28 kilometres outside of Ashgabat.[6] The president of Turkmenistan utilizes a specially made Boeing 777-200LR, painted in the national colours, during international and regional visits. These planes are provided by Turkmenistan Airlines. The president employs a Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicle to transport him throughout the capital city. On some occasions, the vehicle is escorted by a mounted troop from the armed forces. The president also utilizes trains to transport them from one place to another. The ' Presidential Security Service (Prezidentiniň howpsuzlyk gullugy) is responsible for ensuring the protection and security of the president. Established in November 1990, it is a direct reporting body of the President of Turkmenistan. In the early 1990s, the Presidential Security Service was removed from the National Security Committee and transformed into an independent body. On 23 September 1994, the Law of Turkmenistan \"On the operative-search activity\" came into force, according to which one of the main tasks of the service is to ensure the security of the President of Turkmenistan.[7] During state visits to foreign countries, the service provides at least 10 agents to protect the president.[8] The Presidential Security Service is organized in the following way: The Presidential Security Service is currently composed of 2,000 employees.[9] After the dismissal of Khojaberdiyev, the appointment of a new chief was not reported.","Title":"President of Turkmenistan - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14700","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkmenistan"}
