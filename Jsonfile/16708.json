{"Content: ":"Conflict ongoing India Myanmar The insurgency in Nagaland, in northeastern India, is an ongoing conflict fought between the ethnic Nagas and the governments of India. Nagaland inhabited by the Nagas is located at the tri-junction border of India on the West and South, north and Myanmar on the East. \"National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang)\", which wants an independent \"greater Nagaland\" to also include territory now in Myanmar, based on ethnicity; and the \"Naga National Council (Adino)\".[7][full citation needed] The question of \"Naga Sovereignty\" was put to plebiscite on 16 May 1951. To defend themselves, the Naga after much deliberation formed the armed wing of NNC, came to be known as NSG (Naga Safe Guards) under Kaito Sukhai.[8][additional citation(s) needed] 1946 saw the creation of the Naga National Council (NNC) under Phizo's leadership. The NNC leaders and the Governor of Assam, Sir Akbar Hydari, signed a Nine-Point Agreement which granted Nagas rights over their lands and legislative and executive powers. The judicial capacity of Naga courts were empowered and no law from the provincial or central legislatures could affect this agreement. Very significantly, the agreement included a clause demanding that the Nagas be brought into the same administrative unit at the earliest. However, one clause stipulated[9] The Governor of Assam as the agent of the Government of India will have a special responsibility for a period of ten years to ensure that due observance of this agreement to be extended for a further period, or a new agreement regarding the future of the Naga people to be arrived at. The interpretation of this clause has been contested between the Nagas and the Indian Government. To Nagas this clause meant independence from India at the end of the ten-year period. To the India Government this clause meant making a new agreement after the ten-year period if the present agreement did not address Naga issues sufficiently. Phizo rejected the Nine-Point Agreement to who the agreement fell short of dealing with the issue of Naga sovereignty.[10] The NNC under Phizo's leadership declared Naga independence on 14 August 1947 and with success propagated the idea of Naga sovereignty throughout the Naga tribes. A Naga plebiscite was organised on 16 May 1951.[11] The Naga struggle remained peaceful in the 1940s and early 1950s.[10] The Naga insurgency, climaxing in 1956, was an armed ethnic conflict led by the Naga National Council (NNC) which aimed for the secession of Naga territories from India. The more radical sectors of NNC created the Federal Government of Nagaland (FGN) which also included an underground Naga Army.[12] The insurgency witnessed a new spark in 2021 once Fourteen innocent citizens of Nagaland while returning to their homes after a day long work from the coal mines were ambushed and killed by the Indian Army Soldiers of the 21 Para Special Forces army unit.[13] The killings led to wide ranging protests to hold the soldiers accountable and asked for repealing of the Armed Forces Special Power Act. The Act commonly known as AFSPA was enacted in the state in 1958 by central government of India which authorizes soldiers of the armed forces to shoot any suspected individual without formal orders from any superior civilian authority. Several rebel groups have operated in Nagaland since the mid-twentieth century, including the following:","Title":"Ethnic conflict in Nagaland - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16708","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict_in_Nagaland"}
