{"Content: ":"The 2022 Ukraine summer counteroffensive[1][2] is an ongoing military engagement in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine that the Ukrainian authorities have said would take place during the Ukrainian summer of 2022. Serhiy Khlan, a Ukrainian official, stated that the whole of Kherson Oblast would \"definitely\" be retaken by the end of September 2022[3] and president Volodymyr Zelenskyy talked about retaking the region \"step-by-step\".[4] The Institute for the Study of War stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were likely to be either preparing to launch or to have already launched the counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast as of 23 July 2022[update],[5] with presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych officially confirming the start of the operation on 28 July.[6] During the 2022 Southern Ukraine offensive, Russian troops invaded the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv Oblasts. In the early days of the war, Russian troops captured several cities in Southern Ukraine, including Melitopol and Kherson,[7][8] pushing Ukrainian troops back to the city of Mykolaiv in an attempt to reach Odessa from the southeast, though Russian forces were later forced back following the Battle of Voznesensk.[9][10] In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian troops pushed north, eventually defeating Ukrainian servicemen in the Battle of Enerhodar, seizing the city in addition to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[11] Russian forces also pushed east, reaching the Donetsk/Zaporizhzhia administrative borders. Russian forces began a civil-military occupation of Kherson Oblast on 2 March.[12] Occupation authorities reportedly erected a statue of Vladimir Lenin in the town square, introduced Russian curriculum to the local school system, rerouted internet servers to Russia, issued Russian passports, and began circulating the Ruble.[13] By early July, Russia controlled 95% of Kherson and 70% of Zaporizhzhia.[14] Allegedly, hundreds of civilians were abducted by Russian authorities in the two regions.[15][16] In late May, Russian government officials acknowledged the plans to annex both oblasts and were reportedly setting conditions on occupied territory within Zaporizhzhia.[17] A referendum was reportedly planned by Russian occupation authorities in the region for late 2022 to annex Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts,[18] however officials soon moved the date forwards to autumn[19][20] amidst fear of being set back by the Ukrainian Army, according to U.K. intelligence officials.[21] This referendum was described as a \"sham\" by many Western news outlets and government officials.[22][23] Prior to 9 July Ukraine conducted numerous small counterattacks on Russian forces, forcing them into defensive positions.[24] By 11 March the Russian offensive had stalled on numerous fronts within Mykolaiv Oblast, prompting gradual retreat by the end of the month.[25] In April, Ukrainian authorities announced to have pushed the enemy southwards to the border with Kherson Oblast.[26] On 18 April, Russian, DPR, and LPR forces launched the Battle of Donbas, triggering a necessary relocation of most of their armies to the east.[27] The Ukrainian military took advantage of this[28] and pushed on their former positions in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. Ukrainian counterattacks forced Russian troops out of several fortified positions set along the southern border of the Inhulets River.[29] In late May, Ukraine was already launching minor counterattacks on the border between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk Oblasts.[30] By 1 June, the Institute for the Study of War had assessed that Ukrainian counterattacks in Kherson Oblast had successfully reached and disrupted Russian ground lines of communication along the Inhulets River.[31] Throughout June, small parts of northwestern Kherson and northern Zaporizhzha oblasts were regained by Ukrainian forces, with fierce fighting occurring around Davydiv Brid; however, the main line of Russian defenses did not retreat as initially planned.[32] There were numerous reports of partisan warfare within the occupied territories. In the city of Melitopol, Ukrainian resistance leaders had claimed to have killed 100 Russian troops by 5 June.[33] In Kherson, Ukrainian resistance fighters bombed a caf√© frequented by Russian troops, killing Russian collaborators and destroying Russian military infrastructure.[34] There were also reports of railroad tracks being destroyed and bridges being blown up to cut ammunition and enemy troops support. Ukrainian officials first hinted at a large-scale military offensive in mid-to-late June, saying that \"visible results\" should be expected from Ukrainian counteroffensives by August 2022.[35] A Ukrainian general stated on 15 June that if Ukraine were granted weapons, it would be able to mount a massive counteroffensive by the summer.[36] On 5 July, Ukraine launched a major bombing campaign against Russian outposts in Melitopol, reportedly killing 200 soldiers.[37]On 7 July, Ukraine retook Snake Island,[38] affording Ukraine access to valuable sea channels and grain export lanes.[39][40] Meanwhile, Russia tried to strengthen its hold on Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. Russia stated that babies born in Kherson Oblast would automatically receive Russian citizenship, implying that Kherson was a part of the Russian Federation.[41] In the morning of 9 July, Ukrainian government authorities began to urge residents of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts to evacuate from their homes due to an impending Ukrainian counteroffensive.[42] Residents of occupied Kherson in particular were urged to create shelters to \"survive the Ukrainian counteroffensive\".[43] Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukrainian deputy prime minister and Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, warned of intense fighting and shelling in the upcoming days, claiming that the \"ZSU is coming\".[44][45] On 9 July, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered the Ukrainian military, including elements of OC South, to retake occupied territory.[46][47] On the same day, Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov stated that Ukraine was amassing a million-strong fighting force for the offensive.[48] Later Reznikov said that there was a misunderstanding during his interview, and that 1 million is the total number of people that serve in the Ukrainian military, police etc. Also, he claimed that there is no \"specific offensive operation\".[49] On 24 July, Serhiy Khlan, a Kherson region official, stated that \"the Kherson region will definitely be liberated by September, and all the occupiers' plans will fail.\"[3] On 11 July, the Ukrainian army reported that it had recaptured the village of Ivanivka [uk] in Kherson Oblast.[50] Ukrainian troops struck Nova Kakhovka, a Russian command post in Kherson city, with HIMARS missiles, and claimed it killed 12 officers and a Russian major general.[51][52] By the afternoon, Ukrainian authorities claimed that Russian forces were transferring equipment to the left bank of the Dnieper, creating roadblocks within Kherson city in preparation for street battles.[53] Ukrainian authorities urged civilians in Zaporizhzhia Oblast to evacuate, suggesting that a major counteroffensive is underway.[54] On 12 July, Ukraine struck numerous military targets and infrastructure.[55][56] On 13 July, the head of the Kherson regional military administration claimed that Ukraine launched counterattacks along the entire Mykolaiv-Kherson-Zaporizhzhia front line.[57] On 14 July, Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in Radensk (approximately 26 km southeast of Kherson City) and unspecified Russian positions in Nova Kakhovka. Ukraine continued to strike Russian targets and approach towards Kherson over the next week. [58] According to a 24 July statement by Kherson Region official Serhiy Khlan, Ukrainian attacks damaging Antonivka Road Bridge[59] and another key bridge, and attacks on Russian ammunition stores and command posts, were preparatory actions for the offensive.[3] A day earlier, Khlan stated that Ukrainian forces had retaken several villages in Kherson Oblast, but that the Ukrainian authorities requested civilians not to publish information on the progress of the campaign prior to official statements.[5] On 26 July, Antonivka Road Bridge was hit again by a Ukrainian HIMARS missile strike. The bridge remained structurally intact while the bridge's roadway surface was damaged.[60] On 27 July 2022, Ukrainian forces stated that they had retaken control of the villages of Lozove and Andriivka in Beryslav Raion in Kherson Oblast.[61] On July 28, the region's military governor claimed that Ukraine had retaken 44 towns and villages, or 15 percent of the region's territory.[62] Russia offered sporadic casualty claims for Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian Operational Command South offered daily estimates of Russian casualties.","Title":"2022 Ukraine summer counteroffensive - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15660","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Ukraine_summer_counteroffensive"}
