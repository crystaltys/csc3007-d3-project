{"Content: ":"Marcel Rémy (6 February 1923 \u2013 10 July 2022) was a Swiss amateur mountaineer and rock climber.[1] He was well-known for his achievements in rock climbing.[2] The son of François and Bertha Rémy, Marcel was born in the Gruyère District on 6 February 1923. His father was a farmer and a lumberjack before he became a railway worker. He began working as a farmer at a young age. At the age of eight, he discovered mountaineering from contact with tourists. He taught a number of courses in the Vaud Alps and the Fribourg Prealps [fr], as well as the iconic Matterhorn, Grand Combin, and Mont Blanc.[3] Passionate about mountaineering, he introduced many people to the practice, such as his sons, Claude and Yves, who themselves became high-level sport climbers.[4][5] In 2017, at the age of 94, Rémy climbed the Miroir d'Argentine, a 450-meter cliff in the Vaud Alps, accompanied by his two sons. Despite medical operations and two prosthetic hips, he continued to train daily. In 2019, he climbed La guêpe.[6] In 2022, at the age of 99, he climbed a 16-meter indoor rock wall.[7] Marcel Rémy died on 10 July 2022 at the age of 99.[8]","Title":"Marcel Rémy - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17560","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_R%C3%A9my"}
