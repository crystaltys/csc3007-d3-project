The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.[21][18] Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series.[17] Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a growth plate injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.[22][23][19] In 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band.[23][19][10] The first songs they recorded together were called \"She's Broken\" and \"Fingers Crossed\", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. \"We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun,\" she recalled.[24] On November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song \"Ocean Eyes\". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys, before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals.[10][25][19][23] He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz could access and download it.[23][19][26][27] The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. In Rukasin's opinion, she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.[32] In January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract.[30][9][29] Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.[9] On March 24, 2016, a music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel.[33] \"Ocean Eyes\" and Eilish would receive praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC One, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.[37] On June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released \"Six Feet Under\" through SoundCloud as her second single.[38] A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016.[39] It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.[39] In August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first heard \"Ocean Eyes\", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope Records.[28][40] He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a \"persona and distinct aesthetic\".[22] Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Ocean Eyes\" as singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively.[41][42] On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.[43] On January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for \"Ocean Eyes\",[44] and released another EP for \"Six Feet Under\" featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica.[45] Following the success of the \"Ocean Eyes\" remixes, Eilish released \"Bellyache\" on February 24, 2017,[46] A music video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ.[47] Eilish later released \"Bored\" on March 30, 2017, as part of the soundtrack to the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why.[48] A music video for \"Bored\" was later released on June 26, 2017.[49] In March of the same year, Apple Music showcased Eilish at the South by Southwest music festival.[30][34] On June 30, 2017, Eilish released \"Watch\".[50] Eilish later released another single, \"Copycat\", which was released on July 14, 2017,[51] and announced the release of her debut EP, Don't Smile at Me.[52] Eilish later released \"Idontwannabeyouanymore\" and \"My Boy\".[53][54] On August 11, 2017, Eilish released Don't Smile at Me.[55] The EP was a sleeper hit, reaching number 14 on the US Billboard 200.[56] Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour throughout October 2017 in support of her EP.[57] Eilish released \"Bitches Broken Hearts\" through SoundCloud on November 10, 2017.[58][59][60][61] Eilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, \"Today's Top Hits\".[9] The Baffler described Eilish's sound as fitting into the \"streambait\" genre consisting of largely \"mid-tempo, melancholy pop\" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose \"singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production\" shaped the aesthetic.[62][9] Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion.[9] In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1.[63] That month, the live EP titled Up Next Session: Billie Eilish was released.

The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to.\"[139] Eilish and O'Connell wrote three original songs for the 2022 Pixar film Turning Red: \"Nobody Like U,\" \"U Know What's Up\" and \"1 True Love\", performed in the film by the fictional boy band 4*Town.[140] She headlined both weekends of the 2022 Coachella Music Festival, performing with her brother Finneas.

And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing.\"[206] In May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body.[207][208] In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go?
