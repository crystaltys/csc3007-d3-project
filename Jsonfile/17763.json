{"Content: ":"\"The Legend of Xanadu\" is a single by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich that reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1968[2] and was the group's biggest hit. It was written by songwriters Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley. As was the case with many of the group's recordings, it features novelty elements \u2014 a trumpet section and the distinctive sound of a whip cracking in the chorus. The musical accompaniment was directed by John Gregory. The single was certified gold in November 1968.[3] Reviewing for Disc and Music Echo, Penny Valentine wrote: \"Having taken us on a round tour of Israel, Russia and goodness knows where else the gentlemen are now thundering across the prairies with this sort of Marty Robbins/Elmer Bernstein piece, Alpert trumpets, whiplash and all!\" She also described the song as \"very spirited, a lot better than they've done for a long time\".[4] 7\"","Title":"The Legend of Xanadu - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17763","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Xanadu"}
