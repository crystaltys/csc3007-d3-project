{"Content: ":"Eucoelophysis (meaning \"true hollow form\") is a genus of silesaurid dinosauriform from the Late Triassic (Norian) period Chinle Formation of New Mexico. It was assumed to be a coelophysid upon description,[1] but a study by Nesbitt et al. found that it was actually a close relative of Silesaurus,[2][3] which was independently supported by Ezcurra (2006), who found it to be the sister group to Dinosauria, and Silesaurus as the next most basal taxon.[4] However, the relationships of Silesaurus are uncertain. Dzik found it to be a basal dinosauriform (the group of archosaurs from which the dinosaurs evolved), but did not rule out the possibility that it represents a primitive ornithischian.[5]   This article about a prehistoric archosaur is a stub.
