{"Content: ":"Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a species of coronavirus which infects humans and bats.[1] It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to the APN receptor.[2] Along with Human coronavirus OC43 (a member of the Betacoronavirus genus), it is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold.[3][4] HCoV-229E is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus and subgenus Duvinacovirus.[5][6] HCoV-229E transmits via droplet-respiration and fomites. HCoV-229E is associated with a range of respiratory symptoms, ranging from the common cold to high-morbidity outcomes such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. However, such high morbidity outcomes are almost always seen in cases with co-infection with other respiratory pathogens; there is a single published case report to date of a 229E infection that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in an otherwise healthy patient having no detectable co-infection with another pathogen.[7] HCoV-229E is also among the coronaviruses most frequently codetected with other respiratory viruses, particularly with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV).[8][9][10] HCoV-229E is one of the seven human coronaviruses which include HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 and are globally distributed.[11][12] However, the viruses were detected in different parts of the world at different times of the year.[13][14][15] A NCBI-study found a previous HCoV-229E infection in 42.9% \u2013 50.0% of children of 6\u201312 months of age and in 65% of those 2.5\u20133.5 years of age.[16] HCoV-229E is one of seven known coronaviruses to infect humans. The other six are:[17] Chloroquine, a zinc ionophore, inhibits the replication of Human coronavirus 229E in cell culture.[18] Human HCoV-229E, and human HCoV-NL63, likely originated from bats.[19] A researcher at the University of Chicago, Dorothy Hamre, first identified 229E in 1965.[20][21]","Title":"Human coronavirus 229E - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15179","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_229E"}
