{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Eswatini is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Eswatini in March 2020.[2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] Model-based simulations for Eswatini suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t was lower than 1.0 from August to October 2020.[8] ","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Eswatini - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10284","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Eswatini"}
