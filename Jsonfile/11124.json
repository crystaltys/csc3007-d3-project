{"Content: ":"Valneva COVID-19 vaccine, also known as VLA2001 (Original Wuhan variant based)[3] is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by French biotechnology company Valneva SE in collaboration with the American biopharmaceutical company[4] Dynavax Technologies.[5][6] In April 2022, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the vaccine, being the first in the world to do so.[1] It was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2022.[2] It is a whole inactivated virus vaccine,[5] grown in culture using the Vero cell line and inactivated with BPL. It also contains two adjuvants: alum and CpG 1018.[7] It uses the same manufacturing technology as Valneva's Ixiaro vaccine for Japanese encephalitis.[3] VLA2001 completed Phase I/II trial with 153 participants in the United Kingdom.[8][9] The trials were supported by the UK National Institute for Health Research and four British universities.[10] On 21 April 2021, VLA2001 commenced Phase III trials with approximately 4,000 volunteers.[11] In August 2021, New Zealand was chosen for trialing on 300 adult volunteers, due to low case numbers and slow vaccine rollout.[12] Positive results for the Phase III trials were reported in October 2021.[13] In April 2022, Valneva's COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001 has been approved by the United Kingdom's MHRA.[14][1] The availability of the vaccine is very limited, after the UK government tore up the contract to supply it.[15] In May 2022, the company announced that its vaccine VLA2001 has been granted emergency use authorization from the UAE.[16] In May 2022, European Union's drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), accepted Valneva's filing of a marketing authorization for VLA2001.[17] In June 2022, the EMA announced that it would propose to authorize Valneva's COVID-19 (inactivated, adjuvanted) vaccine in the EU, primarily for vaccination of people aged 18 to 50 years.[18][19] In September 2020, Valneva reached an agreement with Dynavax to help manufacture up to 100 million doses of vaccine in 2021 at its facility in Livingston, Scotland, and to provide up to 190 million doses over a 5-year period to the UK government.[20] Due to government support, Valneva progressed immediately into Phase III trials and develop production capacity before the full evaluation of the Phase I/II trial, rather than the traditional slower sequential approach which has lower financial risk.[21] In September 2021, Valneva announced that the UK government had cancelled the vaccine order.[22] The cancellation reason was not officially given, but seems to be related to difficulties getting building materials due to Brexit[23] and not vaccine quality. On 10 November 2021, the European Commission approved a contract with Valneva providing the possibility to purchase almost 27 million doses of its vaccine in 2022. This also includes the possibility to adapt the vaccine to new variants as well as the order of an additional 33 million vaccine doses in 2023.[24] In May 2022, the European Commission announced that it may terminate its contract with Valneva due to the delay in the approval of VLA2001, but that no final decision has been made.[25] A few days after the commission's announcement the European Medicines Agency accepted Valneva's filing of marketing authorization, the start of the formal approval process.[17] Valneva COVID-19 vaccine has been granted a marketing authorization in the European Union following a notification by the EMA on 23 June 2022. The EU's medicines regulator has recommended the vaccine primarily for vaccination of 18 to 50 year olds.[18][19]","Title":"Valneva COVID-19 vaccine - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11124","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valneva_COVID-19_vaccine"}
