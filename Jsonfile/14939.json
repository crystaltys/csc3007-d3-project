{"Content: ":"The Consultative Assembly (Arabic: مجلس الشورى القطري, romanized: Majlis as-Shura; also known as the Shura Council) is the legislative body of the State of Qatar, with 45 members. Following the 2021 Qatari general election, it has 30 elected members and 15 appointed members.[1][2] The body can only question the prime minister, who is appointed by the Emir of Qatar, on his policies if two-thirds of the members agree, which is unlikely given that one-third of the members are appointed by the Emir.[3] The Council was formed in April 1972 with 20 appointed members.[4] In May 1972, the first consultative assembly meeting was held, during which Sayed Aziz bin Khalid Al Ghanim was elected as the assembly's first chairman. Aside from the 20 members who took part in the meeting, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani and foreign dignitaries were also in attendance.[5] Qatar's constitution, approved in April 2003 by popular referendum, has created a legislative body to be two thirds elected by universal suffrage, and one third appointed by the Emir. According to the constitution, the legislature will have three powers: to approve (but not prepare) the national budget; to monitor the performance of ministers through no-confidence votes; and to draft, discuss, and vote on proposed legislation, which becomes law only with the vote of a two-thirds majority and the Emir's endorsement.[citation needed] The consultative assembly has the following functions:[6] The current Chairman of the Consultative Assembly is Hassan bin Abdullah Al-Ghanim.[7] Speaker Deputy speaker Rapporteurs[9] Elected members[6] [6] In 2006 it was announced that legislative elections would take place in 2007; according to a 1 April statement by then-First Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, who later became Prime Minister of Qatar. That was postponed and an advisory committee was established to study the issue. The legislative council rescheduled the elections for June 2010.[14] The election did not take place in 2010. In November 2011, the Emir announced that the election would take place in 2013,[1][2] but they were postponed prior to the retiring Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani transferring power to his son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.[15] The Consultative Assembly's term was extended until 2016.[16] In November 2017, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani appointed four women to the 45-member council, marking the first time women have taken part in the council.[17] However, the elections were then postponed until 2019, with the prior term extended once again.[18] In October 2019 the Emir issued an order for a committee to be formed to organise the elections, chaired by Prime Minister Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdul Aziz Al Thani.[19] In November 2020, the Emir pledged to hold the elections in October 2021.[20] The 2021 Qatari general election was held on 2 October 2021.","Title":"Consultative Assembly of Qatar - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14939","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Qatar"}
