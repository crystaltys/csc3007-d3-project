During his four years as secretary in the Radio circle of the school, Shan taught the younger students about radio and how to make it in practice. Meanwhile, his father realized that he was working towards the radio in this way whereas Shan was sent to \"Shard House School\" in England to learn more. But it closed in about a year.

On Ivan's acquaintance, Shan learned to make televisions from an old Indian television maker, which was during the era of black-n-white television. In the meantime, he was able to pass the Amada Television Sound exam, which gave a certificate that he could sit at home and do TV shows.[6][7] While returning Sri Lanka from vacation in 1968, Vernon Correa of the Broadcasting Corporation gave me a hint. Correa said that according to Article 35 (17), a television channel can be licensed in Sri Lanka. They went to meet the then Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake to talk about the matter along with Ranjith Wijewardene. However, the licence could not pass during Senanayake's government. Later, Sirimavo Bandaranaike saw Shan's presentation and gave the opportunity to telecast the Non-Aligned Movement. During 1968/69, Shan brought Sony television to Sri Lanka.[6][7] Meanwhile, late president J.R. Jayawardane's government also did not licensed Shan's proposal. After many arguments and debates, he was asked to pay Rs. 100,000 before December 1, 1979 and told to start on April 13. Otherwise the license would be revoked.
