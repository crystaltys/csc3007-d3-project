{"Content: ":"Bennettazhia is a genus of tapejaromorph pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous period of what is now the Hudspeth Formation of the state of Oregon in the United States. Although originally identified as a species of the pteranodontoid pterosaur Pteranodon, Bennettazhia is now thought to have been a different animal. The type and only species is B. oregonensis. In 1928, Charles Gilmore named a new species of Pteranodon: P. oregonensis. A humerus (holotype MPUC V.126713), two fused dorsal vertebrae and the broken-off end of some joint bone had been unearthed from the Lower Cretaceous (Albian stage) beds of the Hudspeth Formation in Wheeler County, in the state of Oregon, United States, to which the specific epithet refers. Gilmore noted similarities to Nyctosaurus though the specimens were larger. In 1989, S. Christopher Bennett concluded that the remains might be those of a member of the Azhdarchidae instead of a pteranodontid. Russian paleontologist Lev Nesov therefore in 1991 named a new azhdarchid genus: Bennettazhia. The genus name honors Bennett and combines his name with Persian azhdarha, \"dragon\", a reference to Azhdarcho, the type genus of the Azhdarchidae. Bennett himself in 1994 changed his opinion and stated that it belonged to the Dsungaripteridae. Wellnhofer (1991), Peters (1997), Kellner (2003) and Unwin (2003) left it as belonging to the Pterodactyloidea incertae sedis. In 2007, American biologist Michael Habib revealed the result of a study by CAT-scan of the type specimen of Bennettazhia. The humerus, 183 millimeters (7.2 in) long, is uncrushed, which is uncommon for a pterosaur fossil and therefore offered a rare opportunity to investigate the bone structure. Apart from the thin bone wall, the humerus was filled with a spongy tissue consisting of trabeculae, very thin bone layers and struts, forming a light yet strong construction. Habib inferred that such strength would have allowed even very large pterosaurs to launch themselves from the ground using their forelimbs. The same investigation made a better classification possible. The humerus has an elongated deltopectoral crest that is unwarped. Both dsungaripterids and azhdarchoids show this feature, but only the latter group is typified by such a very thin outer bone wall. Habib concluded that Bennettazhia was a member of the Azhdarchoidea, a more encompassing group than the Azhdarchidae. The cladogram below follows a 2014 phylogenetic analysis by Brian Andres and colleagues. In the analysis, they placed Bennettazhia within the clade Tapejaromorpha, as the basalmost member.[1] Neoazhdarchia Bennettazhia oregonensis Eopteranodon lii \"Sinopterus\" gui Nemicolopterus crypticus Huaxiapterus jii Sinopterus dongi \"Huaxiapterus\" benxiensis \"Huaxiapterus\" corollatus Tupandactylus navigans Tupandactylus imperator Bakonydraco galaczi Europejara olcadesorum Tapejara wellnhoferi   ","Title":"Bennettazhia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"483","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennettazhia"}
