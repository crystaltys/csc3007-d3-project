{"Content: ":"The National Assembly is the lower house of the Parliament of the Central African Republic. Members are elected in single-member constituencies using the two-round (or Run-off) system. Members serve five-year terms.[1] The National Assembly formed following elections held on 13 March and 8 May 2005, and had a total of 105 members. The legislature of the Central African Republic was previously (at least as of 1990[2]) a bicameral institution known as Congress, of which the National Assembly was the lower house; the upper house was called the Economic and Regional Council (French: Conseil Economique et Regional). The National Assembly will be dissolved by Jan 11, 2014 and new legislative elections will be held, according to a ceasefire agreement signed between the government and the Seleka rebel coalition on Jan 11, 2013 in Libreville, Gabon. According to the agreement, a national unity government will be formed and a prime minister will be chosen from the opposition parties.[3] The National Assembly is the lower house of the Parliament of the Central African Republic since the ratification of the Constitution of the Central African Republic on March 27, 2016.
