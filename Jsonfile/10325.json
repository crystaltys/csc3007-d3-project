{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Sierra Leone on 31 March 2020.[3] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[4][5] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[6][7] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[8][6]  The president of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio, confirmed the country's first case of coronavirus disease 2019 on 31 March, a 37-year-old man who traveled from France on 16 March and had been in isolation since.[10] This single case remained active at the end of the month.[11] On 1 April, Sierra Leone confirmed its second case which had no history of travel or contact with the country's first case.[12] The government announced a 3-day lockdown starting on 5 April.[13] On 4 April, two more cases were confirmed and a further two on 5 April bringing the total to 6.[14] On 9 April, after the end of the three-day lockdown, the government announced additional measures. For an initial period of 14 days all inter-district travel is restricted, a curfew from 21:00 - 06:00 is in effect, shops are to sell essential items only and people are to stay at home unless they have good reason not to. Face masks are strongly encouraged, especially in public places.[15] On 12 April, a government press release stated that the last 3 of the 10 infected people had been undergoing self isolation and all 10 are in the treatment facility in a stable condition. In total 1,354 people had entered quarantine for 2 weeks and 736 had completed the 2 weeks and been released.[16] On 19 April, the first 6 recoveries were reported, following negative test results for the virus. 29 people remained in a stable condition with the virus and 516 were in quarantine. On 21 April, it was announced that President Julius Maada Bio was self isolating following a positive test for the virus by one of his body guards.[17] On 23 April, the first death of a 76-year-old male was reported,[18] followed by a 69-year-old male later in the day. Both cases were in people taken to hospital and found to be infected after death. All those infected and in isolation remain in a stable condition. On 24 April, a third death was reported of a 37-year-old male. By the end of April, 124 persons had tested positive and seven had died. Of the remaining 117 patients, 21 had recovered while 96 remained active cases at the end of the month.[19] A new 3 day lockdown was announced starting on 3 May. On 3 May, 1,341 people were in quarantine with 29 total recoveries.[20] In May there were 737 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 861. The death toll rose to 46. The number of recovered patients increased to 454, leaving 361 active cases at the end of the month.[21] Model-based simulations suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t was below 1.0 in May.[22] From 1 June, wearing of face masks became compulsory.[23] Also on this day, frontline workers declared a strike because of unpaid salaries.[24] By 4 June, a total of 4,827 people had passed through quarantine, there were 468 female cases and 446 male cases.

The number of recovered patients more than doubled to 974, leaving 428 active cases at the end of the month.[25] Model-based simulations suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number Rt remained below 1.0 in June.[22] 2 July, the government changed the international travel restrictions, banning all passenger flights until 15 July. On 5 July there were 759 female cases and 783 male. 7,738 people had passed through quarantine.

On 10 July the president announced that places of worship could reopen from 13 July. Air travel could resume from the same date.
