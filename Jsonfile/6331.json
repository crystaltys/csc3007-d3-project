{"Content: ":"Eschborn (German pronunciation: [ˈɛʃbɔʁn] (listen)) is a town in the Main-Taunus district, Hesse, Germany. It is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area and has a population of 21,488 (2018). Eschborn is home to numerous corporations due to its proximity to Frankfurt and relatively low business tax rate. Most of \"old\" Eschborn is on the streets Hauptstraße, near the Eschborn S-Bahn station, and Unterortstraße, including the Rathaus (Town Hall) and some old churches. The village of Niederhöchstadt is part of Eschborn, but with a different phone area code (same as the adjacent community of Kronberg). Between Eschborn and the communities to the north and west are particularly green stretches with some pretty houses, nice walks in the foothills of the Taunus mountains. Eschborn provides expansive views of the Taunus mountain ranges, especially the 'Altkönig' and behind it the 'Feldberg' up to elevations of around 880 m above sealevel. From Eschborn to the north there are numerous hiking and biking trails leading up to these green mountain zones. In winter, along and up those hills you will even find cross country skiing slopes as well as downhill sled runs used by large crowds of people, esp. on weekends. Eschborn was first mentioned at the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne as king of the Franks. The reason for this first written mention of Eschborn, spelled \u2018Aschenbrunne\u2019, was a deed of donation (in the name of the martyr Nazarius [de]) to the Benedictine Lorsch Abbey, which is about 60 km south of Eschborn.[3] The name Aschenbrunne means \"well at the ash tree\". Large areas of the town are still undeveloped and green expanses fuse in with several high-rises, with a brook passing by the Rathaus (Town Hall) and running close to the S-Bahn railway line, that joins the river Nidda (which in turn is a tributary of the River Main that flows through Frankfurt am Main).
