{"Content: ":"Russian Armed Forces Ukrainian Armed Forces The battle of Dovhenke was a series of military engagements in the village of Dovhenke, 20 kilometers south of the city of Izium, between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during the Northeastern Ukraine offensive and Eastern Ukraine offensive of the battle of Donbas. Dovhenke is a small place on the very border of the Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblast. On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, in a steep escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which had begun in 2014. The invasion caused Europe's fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II,[2][3] with more than 6.5 million Ukrainians fleeing the country[4] and a third of the population displaced.[5][6] On 1 April, the Ukrainian military confirmed Izium was under Russian control.[7][8] The following day, in an interview for Ukrinform, Izium's Deputy Mayor Volodymyr Matsokin claimed that 80% of the city's residential buildings had been destroyed and that there was no power, heating, or water in the city.[9] On 11 April, Russian forces launched an attack against Dovhenke and Dmytrivka [uk], which was repelled by Ukrainian forces.[10] On 15 May, the Ukrainian military announced that Russia had launched a new assault to take the village.[11] On 6 June, according to the Ukrainian News Agency, Ukrainian soldiers repulsed a new attack on Dovhenke, with Russian forces withdrawing part of their units to Izium due to losses sustained.[12] At this time, Russian State Duma Deputy Alexander Borodai reportedly traveled to Dovhenke to take part in the assault on the village with the Donbas Volunteer Union.[13] By 12 June, Ukraine reported the Russian army was conducting an assault from Dovhenke towards Mazanivka and Dolina, indicating the village had been captured by Russian forces.[14] As of 25 June, fighting continued near Dovhenke,[15] but at the end of the month, Russian operations moved to the south of the village,[16] with Russian troops attempting to advance from Dovhenke towards Mazanivka.[1]","Title":"Battle of Dovhenke - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16253","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dovhenke"}
