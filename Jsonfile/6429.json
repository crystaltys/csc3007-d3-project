{"Content: ":"The Emirate of Dubai (Arabic: إمارة دبيّ; pr. Imārat Dubayy) is one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates.[5] It is considered the most populous emirate of the UAE. The capital of the emirate is the eponymous city, Dubai. It is located in the Arabian Desert on the coast of the Persian Gulf. It is bordered to the south by the emirate of Abu Dhabi, to the northeast by the emirate of Sharjah, to the southeast by the country of Oman, to the west by the emirate of Ajman, and to the north by the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah. In December 1971, the emirates united to form the United Arab Emirates, thus ending their status as British Protectorates.[6][7] The ruler of the emirate is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.[8] The emirate is made up of various other municipalities and villages. The inland exclave of Hatta is located about 134 km east of the city of Dubai. It is bordered by Oman to the east and south, the villages of Sayh Mudayrah and Masfout in Ajman to the west, and Ras Al Khaimah to the north.","Title":"Emirate of Dubai - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6429","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Dubai"}
