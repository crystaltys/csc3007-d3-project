{"Content: ":"Zoo emergency response teams, also called emergency weapons teams, lethal restraint teams or firearms emergency response teams, are teams that respond when zoo animals escape their enclosure and threaten zoo visitors and employees. Emergency response teams are responsible for the capture of escaped animals. Goals include: (listed in order of priority) Emergency response teams are not full-time but are typically composed of zoo employees who have received special weapons training from a police agency. They are trained to use deadly force, but only as a last resort when the escaped animal is threatening the life of a human being. Zoos frequently perform training drills in order to keep the team up to date and ready for a real animal escape.[1] When an animal escapes, guests are immediately evacuated from the area and escorted to secured buildings on zoo grounds by the zoo\u2019s emergency response team (veterinarians armed with tranquilizer equipment, zoo firearms team and animal management staff). The zoo\u2019s perimeter is sealed off for safety and is usually reopened after the animal is secured.[2] Australian zoos use a set of standard emergency radio codes for dealing with escaped animals.[3] Many zoos in America have a similar policy.[4] Many zoos created or enhanced their emergency response teams following a gorilla attack at the Dallas Zoo in 2004. On February 24, 2007, an emergency response team at the Denver Zoo shot and killed a jaguar which had attacked a zookeeper.[5] The zookeeper later died from her injuries. On May 28, 2016, a 4-year-old boy climbed through a public barrier at Gorilla World at around 4pm at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden and fell into the exhibit\u2019s moat. The two female gorillas in the exhibit were recalled immediately, but the third, a male named Harambe, remained in the yard with the child. The Zoo\u2019s Dangerous Animal Response Team responded to the situation by fatally shooting the gorilla.
