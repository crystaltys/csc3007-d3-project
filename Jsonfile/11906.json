{"Content: ":"The Ireviken event was the first of three relatively minor extinction events (the Ireviken, Mulde, and Lau events) during the Silurian period. It occurred at the Llandovery/Wenlock boundary (mid Silurian, 433.4 ± 0.8 million years ago). The event is best recorded at Ireviken, Gotland, where over 50% of trilobite species became extinct; 80% of the global conodont species also become extinct in this interval. The event lasted around 200,000 years, spanning the base of the Wenlock epoch.[2][4] It comprises eight extinction \"datum points\"\u2014the first four being regularly spaced, every 30,797 years, and linked to the Milankovic obliquity cycle.[4] The fifth and sixth probably reflect maxima in the precessional cycles, with periods of around 16.5 and 19 ka.[4] The final two data are much further spaced, so harder to link with Milankovic changes.[4] The mechanism responsible for the event originated in the deep oceans, and made its way into the shallower shelf seas. Correspondingly, shallow-water reefs were barely affected, while pelagic and hemipelagic organisms such as the graptolites, conodonts and trilobites were hit hardest.[2] Subsequent to the first extinctions, excursions in the δ13C and δ18O records are observed; δ13C rises from +1.4\u2030 to +4.5\u2030, while δ18O increases from −5.6\u2030 to −5.0\u2030.[2]","Title":"Ireviken event - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11906","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireviken_event"}
