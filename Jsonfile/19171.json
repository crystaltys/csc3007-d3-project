{"Content: ":"Frank Millar is a Northern Irish journalist and former unionist politician. The son of Frank Millar, also a unionist politician, he was known as \"Frank Millar Jr\" during his early political career. He joined the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), and remained a member when his father left the organisation to sit as an independent Unionist. Millar was the Press Officer of the UUP during the early 1980s.[1] He stood unsuccessfully for 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly in South Antrim.[2] However, he was elected to that body in 1984 in an uncontested by-election in Belfast South caused by the IRA murder of Edgar Graham.[3] In 1983, Millar became the General Secretary of the UUP.[1] At the 1987 UK general election, he stood in Belfast West, receiving 18.7% of the votes cast.[4] The same year, he worked with UUP MP Harold McCusker and the DUP's Peter Robinson to produce a report on power sharing, following a positive report on the topic by the Ulster Political Research Group. The Task Force Report gave serious consideration to the idea, and called for a strategic unionist rethink in the wake of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was rejected by their respective leaders, Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux. Millar then resigned from his party post.[5] Millar subsequently became a journalist and has long been the London Editor of the Irish Times. In 1998, he was named the Irish Print Journalist of the Year. In 2004, he wrote a biography of UUP leader David Trimble, entitled David Trimble: The Price of Peace.[6]","Title":"Frank Millar Jr - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19171","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Millar_Jr"}
