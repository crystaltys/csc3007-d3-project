{"Content: ":"The Rugini were a tribe in Pomerania. They were only mentioned once, in a list of yet to be converted tribes drawn up by the English monk Bede (also Beda venerabilis) in his Historia ecclesiastica of the early 8th century:[1][2][clarification needed] Sunt autem Fresones, Rugini, Danai, Hunni, Antiqui Saxones, Boructuari; sunt alii perplures hisdem in partibus populi paganis adhuc ritibus servientis.[2] Whether the Rugini were remnants of the Rugii is speculative.[1] The term Rugini was also interpreted as the first mention of the Slavic Rani (also Rujani), who in the Middle Ages dwelled on the isle of RÃ¼gen.[2][3] This article about an ethnic group in Europe is a stub.
