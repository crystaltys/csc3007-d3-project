Hundreds of cars were lined up for about three miles waiting to get into the drive-thru center. It opened at 8 a.m., and by noon, people were turned away as the center was at capacity. Health workers at the site tested more than 650 people.[26][27] On March 21, the testing site at Bergen Community College reached its daily capacity of 350 tests within two hours.[28][29] New drive-through testing centers opened at Hudson Regional Hospital, Kean University, and PNC Bank Arts Center.[30][31] By April 4, the state reported an average of 5,000 tests a day, and was only testing symptomatic people.[46] The state had about 66 testing sites by April 15.[55] By March 27, New Jersey's state laboratory had run 28,043 coronavirus tests with 8,296 positive ones for a rate of 33.4%. At least one positive test had been found in 55 of the state's 375 nursing homes.[37] By April 18, 147,850 coronavirus tests had been performed in New Jersey, with a positivity rate of 45.14%.[58] The state was conducting about 9,000 tests a day by April 22. Governor Murphy said he thought New Jersey would need to double its daily tests and include asymptomatic people before reopening its economy.[62] All covered workers in the following settings are currently required to be fully vaccinated or subject to COVID-19 testing at minimum one to two times per week: Health care facilities and high-risk congregate settings, Preschool through Grade 12 schools, State agencies, authorities, colleges, and universities, Child care facilities. In South Jersey, some farmers have refused to allow testing for seasonal farm workers who have been hired from high-risk states like Florida, North Carolina and Georgia. The majority of these growers are located in Cumberland County. Among the dozens of growers who refused participation in the state's campaign to offer free testing for thousands of migrant workers are six blueberry farms in Atlantic County. Unlike long-term care facilities farmers are not required to comply with the initiative, but a bill has been proposed to make it non-optional.[137] On March 17, Governor Murphy said that as of 8 p.m., all of the state's amusement centers, amusement parks, and shopping malls would be closed indefinitely. \"This is a virus unlike everything we've ever seen in our lifetime,\" Murphy said. According to Marilou Halvorsen, the president and CEO of the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association, 90% of restaurant employees were laid off on the 16th. There were 15,000 unemployment applications filed on the 16th, and the increase caused the computer system at the state Department of Labor to crash.[20] On March 19, Murphy ordered all personal care businesses that could not maintain proper social distancing to close by 8 p.m. on the 19th; these businesses included barbershops, hair salons, nail salons, spas, and tattoo parlors. That day, Murphy said, \"We've basically shut the state down. Stay home.\"[24][23][25] A day later, Governor Murphy announced the closure of all non-essential businesses. \"It brings me no joy, but we have no choice. We will, within the next 24 hours, further tighten screws in terms of social distancing,\" Murphy said. Unemployment claims in New Jersey increased 20% for the week ending March 14 compared to the same period the previous year.[26][27] On March 26, Governor Murphy said that 155,000 people filed for unemployment benefits in New Jersey during the previous week, 16 times the number that filed the week before.[36] The economy was affected negatively by the coronavirus, and the state prepared for a drop in tax revenue by putting $900 million into reserve in late March.[30][31] State lawmakers moved New Jersey's income tax deadline from April 15 to July 15 and moved New Jersey's budget deadline from June 30 to September 30. According to the lawmakers, \"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused hardships, financial strain, and disruptions for many New Jerseyans and New Jersey businesses.\"[44] State workers were furloughed for multiple weeks. A hotline was set up for New Jersey workers to report employers for making them go to work despite the emergency declaration, but it got so many calls that it crashed the system. The state subsequently set up a website for workers to report violations.[36] By March 31, police in Newark had closed 16 nonessential businesses and issued over 250 summonses for obstructing the business of law. The Ocean County towns of Bay Head, Mantoloking, and Point Pleasant Beach decided to close their beaches starting April 3 to slow the spread of the virus.[138] The statewide restrictions put into place due to the coronavirus caused many business closings and layoffs.
