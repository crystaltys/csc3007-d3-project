{"Content: ":"Ride of the Valkyrie is a 1967 British short comedy film directed by Peter Brook and starring Julia Foster, Zero Mostel, and Frank Thornton.[1] An opera singer (Zero Mostel), dressed in full costume and dress, must navigate through the busy city streets to get to the theater in time for his performance. It was originally commissioned by producer Oscar Lewenstein, then a director of Woodfall, as one third of a 'portmanteau' feature entitled Red White and Zero, with sections supplied by Lindsay Anderson, Tony Richardson and Karel Reisz[2] Reisz dropped out with his section becoming Brook's Ride of the Valkyrie. The two other planned sections of the film developed into what became Richardson's Red and Blue and Anderson's The White Bus. Of these, only The White Bus received a theatrical release in the UK.[3]  This article related to a short comedy film is a stub.
