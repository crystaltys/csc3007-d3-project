{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Liberia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Liberia in March 2020.[2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[3][4] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[5][6] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[7][5] On 16 March, the first case in Liberia was confirmed, a government official who traveled from Switzerland.[8] President George Weah controversially named the person, and claimed they violated screening protocols at Roberts International Airport (RIA) in Harbel.[9] The second case was confirmed on 17 March, a close contact of the first case.[10] Liberia's third case of COVID-19 was confirmed on 20 March. The third person was a returned traveler. Following this third case, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare declared a national health emergency on 22 March.[11][12] On 24 March, neighboring Ivory Coast announced it closed land borders with Liberia and Guinea in a measure to contain COVID-19.[13] On 27 March, the U.S. Embassy evacuated some U.S. citizens from Liberia.[14] At the end of the month all three cases remained active.[15] Liberia reported its first death on 4 April.[16] On 5 April, the German Embassy together with the European Union organized a charter flight evacuating its citizens.[17] On 7 April, President George Weah appointed a new National Response Coordinator for the Executive Committee on Coronavirus. The committee will be headed by former mayor of the City of Monrovia, Madam Mary Broh.[18][19] Some experts questioned Broh's ability to effectively coordinate the pandemic response given her inexperience in public health protocols. However, her appointment was noted to have been as a result of recommendations from the United Nations, particularly the World Health Organization.[20][17] On 8 April, President George Weah declared lock-down measures to take effect on April 10 and last for 3 weeks, including suspension of all non-essential travel and curfews.[21] Schools were closed across the country, and churches, mosques, bars, and beaches in parts of the country.[12] The National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) recorded a record increase in the number of confirmed cases from 14 to 31, an increase of 17 new cases. They also reported 1 more death. On 21 April, Liberia's legislature wrote a resolution requiring the public to wear masks in public. Enforcement of the law is unclear.[22] As of that date, 29 confirmed cases were healthcare workers (out of 101 total confirmed cases).[23] During the month there were 138 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 141.

The National Public Health Institute of Liberia's policy was to not release names of people with infections to reduce stigmatization and protect privacy, but other government officials (President George Weah, Information Minister Lenn Eugene Nagbe) have advocated for releasing names for better contact tracing.[58]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Liberia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10315","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Liberia"}
