{"Content: ":"William Bankhead Democratic William Bankhead Democratic The 1936 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives in 1936 that coincided with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide re-election. Roosevelt's Democratic Party gained twelve net seats from the Republican Party, bringing them above a three-fourths majority. This was the largest majority since Reconstruction. The last time a party won so decisively was in 1866.[1] Significant representation from the Progressives of Wisconsin and Farmer\u2013Labor Party of Minnesota is also seen, as these two liberal populist groups gained a foothold.[2] The 1936 elections showed the continuing trust for the American people in that Roosevelt would guide the nation from depression. Despite setbacks, the people had faith in the New Deal and elected leaders who supported its measures. This was the last of four straight election losses for Republicans due to the lingering effects of the Depression.[3] Source: Election Statistics \u2013 Office of the Clerk In the 1st district, Republican Arthur B.
