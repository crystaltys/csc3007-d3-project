Plans were in place to move the National Assembly from Stepanakert to Shusha on 9 May 2022 to mark the 30th anniversary of the capture of Shusha,[1][2] but the city came under the control of Azerbaijan in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. The current constitution of Artsakh, amended in 2017, states that all members to National Assembly shall be elected for a five-year term through a proportional electoral system. The National Assembly shall be composed of no less than 27 and no more than 33 MPs. The number of the MPs shall be defined by the Electoral Code.[3] Prior to the passing of the 2017 constitutional referendum, the National Assembly had 33 members, 22 of whom (17 before 2015) were elected using party-list proportional representation, and the rest elected in single seat constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.
