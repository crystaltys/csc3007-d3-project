{"Content: ":"The white-blue-white flag (Russian: бело-сине-белый флаг, romanized: belo-sine-belyj flag) is a symbol of opposition to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine that has been used by Russian anti-war protesters.[1][2][3] It has also been used as a symbol of opposition to the current government of Russia, by several personal internet accounts.[4][5][6] Several people created the idea of the white-blue-white flag shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine started on 24 February 2022. Kai Katonina, a Berlin-based user experience designer, and a Russia-based art manager with the pseudonym \"Fish Sounds\" (Звуки Рыб, Zvuki Ryb),[2][3] also known as \"AssezJeune\",[8] are each attributed with having created the flag. It was first used on social media on 28 February 2022,[2][9] and has been flown by Russian expatriates at various anti-war protests.[10] One of the reasons for replacing the red stripe of the flag of Russia by a white one is to remove the association with \"blood and violence\".[7][6][11][12][13][14] AssezJeune, one of the creators of the flag, stated: \"The red on the modern Russian flag is associated not just with blood, but with its military power and authoritarian strength. So, this is not just the removal of blood, but, most importantly, the removal of the cult of militarism and violence. WBR is a historical authoritarian flag introduced by Tsarist Russia. It's also associated with militarism, with Russian imperial cores.\"[15][16] Use of the flag began shortly after the start of the invasion, and the flag began to garner wide appeal among protesters who oppose the war. The white-blue-white flag has an official website, where it is described as the \"Flag of the Wonderful Russia of the Future\" and \"A symbol of freedom and peace\"; the website includes background information in multiple languages. The flag has not been associated with representing a single organization exclusively, and several anti-war organisations have demonstrated support for it as a broader symbol of anti-war sentiment and unity.[17] The similarity and analogy with the white-red-white flag that has been widely used during the 2020\u20132021 Belarusian protests is often listed as one of its advantages.[16][15] The white-blue-white flag has been used at anti-war protests in Tbilisi, Georgia,[18] Berlin, Germany,[19][20] Sofia, Bulgaria,[21] Bern, Switzerland,[22] Limassol, Cyprus,[7][20] Prague, Czech Republic,[4][23] The Hague, Netherlands,[24] and Riga, Latvia.[25] In addition, some media have reported that the flag has also been used by protesters in Yekaterinburg, Russia, although this claim has not been supported by any evidence.[4][20][26] On 31 March 2022, the head of the Duma commission on foreign interference, Vasily Piskarev, appealed to the Prosecutor General's Office to ban the white-blue-white Russian flag as extremist, since \"this symbolism is used in protests against the military operation in Ukraine not only in Russia, but also in other countries\".[27] Members of the Freedom of Russia Legion (Russian: Легион «Свобода России», romanized: Legion \"Svoboda Rossii\"), composed of Russians who defected from the Russian Armed Forces to Ukraine, have been seen wearing patches of the flag on their military uniforms.[28][29] The white-blue-white flag (as well as other symbols of Russia) was banned during the Equality Parade in Warsaw, held alongside KyivPride.[30] KyivPride published a statement about possible provocations, labeling any intentions to \"display russian flags of any color\" a provocation and an unacceptable step meant to advance the Russian agenda.[31] A similar flag design was previously used as the municipal flag of Veliky Novogorod (1994-2006) The former state flag of Belarus was adopted by oppositionist parties and were used in the 2020\u20132021 Belarusian protests Protests of Russians in Yerevan against the war in Ukraine on 17 April 2022 White-blue-white flag in Tbilisi, Georgia on 2 March 2022","Title":"White-blue-white flag - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16011","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-blue-white_flag"}
