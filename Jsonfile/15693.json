The city of Sumy was founded in the 1650s by the Cossacks within the region of Sloboda Ukraine. Sumy was founded by Cossack Herasym Kondratyev from Stavyshche, Bila Tserkva Regiment on the bank of the Psel River, a tributary of the Dnieper.[4] The date of its foundation is a subject of discussion (in 1652 or 1655).[4] In 1656\u201358 at the site of Sumyn early settlement, under the leadership of Muscovite voivode K. Arsenyev, there was built a city-fort that consisted of a fort and a grad (town).[4] In the 1670s it was expanded by adding a fortified posad (craftsmen town), after which Sumy became the biggest fortress of Sloboda Ukraine.[4] From 1658 Sumy was a center of the Sumy Cossack Regiment (military unit and local administrative division).[4] In the 1680s around Sumy started to form unfortified suburbs.[4] At the end of the 17th century, Sumy played a role of collection point of Muscovite troops during the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689.[4] During the Great Northern War, from December 1708 to January 1709 the city was the stavka (headquarters) of Muscovite Chief of Commander headed by Tsar Peter the Great.[4] Established under the leadership of Prince A. Shakhovskoy, in 1734\u201343 in Sumy was located the Commission on streamlining the Sloboda Cossack regiments.[4] From its establishment and until the liquidation of Cossackdom in Sloboda Ukraine in 1765, the Cossack officer family of Kondratyevs had a great influence over the city.[4] Following the liquidation of Cossack community in 1765, Sumy Cossack Regiment as an administrative division was turned into Sumy Province of the newly created Sloboda Ukraine Governorate and the city of Sumy became its center.[4] In 1780 Sumy was turned into a centre of Sumy uyezd.[4] In 1786-89 the city was reformed by removing its city fort vallums.[4] After a period of stagnation (1765\u20131860s), Sumy began to transform into a big industrial and trade center with the Paul's Sugar-Refining Factory (est. 1869 by I.Kharytonenko) and the Sumy Engineering Workshops (est. 1896, producing equipment for sugar refineries).[4] With the construction of a railroad Vorozhba \u2013 Merefa, in January 1877 in the city was built the Sumy train station.[4] A great contribution in development of Sumy made various families of philanthropist industrialists, the most famous of which are the Kharytonenkos.[4] During the Revolution of 1905, Sumy was one of several areas which became famous throughout Russia for in effect having established an independent peasant republic; the Sumy Republic was established by a peasant union.[5] During the German occupation of Ukraine during World War II (1941\u20131944), Sumy sustained heavy damage and was occupied from 10 October 1941 to 2 September 1943.
