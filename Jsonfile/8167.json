{"Content: ":"Ikast is a Danish town in the Mid Jutland Region (Midtjylland). It is the seat of Ikast-Brande Municipality since 2007. It was the seat of the former Ikast Municipality. The town is situated in the middle of Jutland. The town is situated 5 km from Hammerum, which is the Eastern outskirts of Herning Municipality. Ikast is situated 28 km from Silkeborg, and 69 km away from Aarhus. As of 1 January 2022, the population of the town is 15,979.[1] Up until late in the nineteenth century, Ikast was nothing more than a few buildings surrounding the church. During industrialization, Ikast established a strong presence in Denmark as one of the main towns for the textile industry, which was the main industry in the area until the start of globalization, where production jobs were outsourced. The opening of the railway line in the 1850s led to an increase in population, as the existing part of town surrounding the church, and the new part of town, built around the railway station, grew into each other.[3] The church was originally a Romanesque church, built in the 13th century. The old church burned down in 1904, and was rebuilt into the new church, which was finished in 1907. The church was expanded several times, with the latest expansion happening in 2005.[4] Media related to Ikast at Wikimedia Commons Coordinates: 56°8\u2032N 9°9\u2032E﻿ / ﻿56.133°N 9.150°E﻿ / 56.133; 9.150","Title":"Ikast - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8167","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikast"}
