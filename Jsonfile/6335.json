{"Content: ":"Bad Vilbel (German: [baːt ˈfɪlbl̩] (listen)) is a spa town in Hesse (Hessen), Germany, famous for its many mineral water springs. Bad Vilbel is the largest town in the Wetteraukreis district and part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area with its city center being located 8 km northeast of downtown Frankfurt am Main at the banks of the river Nidda. Bad Vilbel was founded in 774 (first written document) but much older artefacts were found in the area. In 1848 during railway works, a Roman villa was unearthed with a Thermae and a Mosaic. A replica of this mosaic is presented in a modern exhibition in the spa gardens. The town Vilbel got the label \"Bad\" (spa) in 1948 for its numerous mineral springs. The health spa operations stopped in the 1960s but the mineral water industry connected more springs of the Wetterau by pipelines to the bottling plant of Hassia in Bad Vilbel. The hessian government reform formed 1971/72 Bad Vilbel (with Heilsberg), Dortelweil, Gronau and Massenheim to the new city Bad Vilbel. Since 1997 great areas have been developed for living and business, like the residential area of Dortelweil-West or the commercial park Quellenpark between Bad Vilbel, Massenheim and Dortelweil. fountain near the old town-hall old town-hall Cultural center, old mill Friedrich-Karl-Sprudel Hassia mineral spring exhibition of Roman mosaic shopping & business center in Dortelweil The Current Mayor is Sebastian Wysocki(born 1985) of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU).
