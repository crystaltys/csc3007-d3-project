{"Content: ":"The 2006 dengue outbreak in Pakistan was at the time the worst on record.[1] There were 1931 lab-confirmed cases, and 41 confirmed deaths, according to the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.[2] Other sources report a death toll of 52.[3] Since 2006, studies indicate that dengue fever is on the rise in Pakistan.[4] It is noted throughout the year, peaking at post-monsoon season.[5] Many factors have been cited, including a surge in the principal mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti. and Aedes albopictus[6][7] However, in 2006, an additional factor may have been the lack of patient management standards, since dengue was a relatively new public health challenge for the country.[6]","Title":"2006 dengue outbreak in Pakistan - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10046","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_dengue_outbreak_in_Pakistan"}
