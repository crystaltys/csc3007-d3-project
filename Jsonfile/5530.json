{"Content: ":"The Democratic Governors Association (DGA) is a Washington, D.C.-based 527 organization founded in 1983, consisting of U.S. state and territorial governors affiliated with the Democratic Party.[1] The mission of the organization is to provide party support to the election and re-election of Democratic gubernatorial candidates. The DGA's Republican counterpart is the Republican Governors Association. The DGA is not directly affiliated with the non-partisan National Governors Association. Noam Lee is currently the executive director of the DGA, while Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina is the current chair. Previously known as the Democratic Governors Conference within the Democratic National Committee, the DGA became an independent institution in 1983 under the leadership of Virginia Governor Chuck Robb with the help of Democratic National Committee Chair Charles Manatt. The purpose of the committee was to raise funds to elect Democrats to governorships and to improve the partnership between Democratic governors and the Democratic leadership of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Prior to its current formation in mid-1983, they met as the Democratic Governors Conference. The DGA played a pivotal role in the election of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992. Under the leadership of DGA Chair and Hawaii Governor John Waihe ªe, the DGA helped organize Clinton's \"winning the West\" campaign tour through Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and California. Republicans had handily won all of those states except Washington and Oregon the previous three elections. According to The Washington Post,[2] it was \"all but unthinkable to Republicans that the GOP could lose such stalwart pieces of the party's electoral base as Wyoming and Nevada.\" Clinton lost Wyoming but carried Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, and California. The leadership of the DGA consists of elected Democratic governors. There are currently 22 Democratic governors. In addition to governors of U.S. states, the DGA also offers membership to Democratic governors of U.S. territories. In addition, the DGA offers membership to the mayor of the District of Columbia.

Opportunity. Now.,\" DGA Chair Martin O'Malley said. Executive Director Colm O'Comartun added, \"There is no doubt that we will face a challenging electoral environment in 2012, but our victories in 2011 showed that we know how to wisely and strategically deploy our resources.
