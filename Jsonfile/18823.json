{"Content: ":"Paul Reps (September 15, 1895 \u2013 July 12, 1990) was an American artist, poet, and author. He is best known for his unorthodox haiku-inspired poetry that was published from 1939 onwards. He is considered one of America's first haiku poets. In association with his writing, Reps was also a well-received artist. Many of his books have artwork influenced by Zen Buddhism displayed in association with his writings. Reps had widely traveled and spent a large amount of his time in Asia. In Japan, his art was widely accepted and he often went there in association with the displays of his artwork in galleries and to reaffirm his Buddhist understanding. Reps was well-regarded in Japan. When his 2-month visa expired, he applied for a 1-year commercial visa at the consulate in Japan. They said it would take a month, \"no exceptions.\" He returned 3 days later with the needed papers and agreed to wait the month. But he also included a poem: Drinking a bowl of green tea I stop the war. The visa officer told him to return the next day. He did and was granted a one year visa with an extension good for 4 years. As Reps commented, \"This is what a poem can do for you.\" In the later years of his life, Reps made his home on the island of Maui in Hawaii. In the two years before his death, he lived at the Haven Institute with his friends Jock McKeen and Bennet Wong (McKeen & Wong 1991).   This Zen biography-related article is a stub.
