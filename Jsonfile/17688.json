{"Content: ":"Philip Leonardus Walker (29 August 1954 \u2013 7 July 2022) was an English professional footballer who played as a central midfielder. He played for Millwall, Charlton Athletic and Gillingham in the English Football League. After a brief spell with Eastern AA of Hong Kong, he finished his career with eleven years in Portugal with Leixões, Boavista and Maia. His nephew is the Southampton player, Kyle Walker-Peters.[1] Born in London, Walker joined Millwall in 1975 having played for non-league sides Epsom & Ewell and Cobham prior to that, quickly establishing himself in the centre of the team's midfield.[2] One of the first notable black players in the club's history, he garnered renown as a skilful player with excellent passing; he moved to Charlton Athletic in 1979, and remained there until 1983 when he briefly joined Hong Kong club Eastern AA. Walker spent half a season with Portuguese club Leixões before moving on at the age of 30 to Boavista.[3] He quickly established himself in the starting eleven, and was a first-choice player for the vast majority of his seven-year spell. After nearly five seasons with northern neighbours Maia, then playing in the Portuguese Second Division, Walker retired at the age of 41. He subsequently had a brief stint as Maia's coach in the early 2000s.[4] Following his retirement, Walker returned to England and set up a soccer school in Wandsworth, London. He died on 8 July 2022.[5][6]","Title":"Phil Walker (footballer, born 1954) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17688","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Walker_(footballer,_born_1954)"}
