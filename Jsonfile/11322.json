{"Content: ":"The NHS Nightingale Hospital North East was one of the temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals set up by NHS England to help to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. It was constructed inside the Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing, Washington. To add extra critical care capacity during the COVID-19 epidemic in England, and to treat those with COVID-19, plans were made to create further temporary hospital spaces for those in need of treatment and care.[1][2] They have been named \"Nightingale Hospitals\", after Florence Nightingale who came to prominence for nursing soldiers during the Crimean War and is regarded as the founder of modern nursing.[3] On 12 October, 2020 amidst a rise in cases in Northern England, the hospital was placed on standby.[4] The site was converted to be a hospital at the cost of Â£23.5 million.[5] The site had 460 beds available with the building divided into 16 wards.[6] It was operated by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.[7] The hospital has been prepared by the British Armed forces working with the local NHS Trusts.[8] County Durham MP Richard Holden said, when announcing the hospital on 10 April, that it was expected to be open for patients in the following two weeks.[7] The hospital was officially opened on 5 May 2020, in a virtual ceremony, by Matt Hancock (Secretary of State for Health). The opening ceremony also featured television celebrities Ant and Dec, football pundit Alan Shearer and cricketer Ben Stokes.[9] It was not a conventional walk-in hospital - only patients who are already inpatients in other hospitals in the region and meet certain criteria were to be admitted.[10] They would have stayed at the hospital until they were assessed as being ready to move back to a local hospital.[10] The hospital was kept on standby to treat Covid patients but did not admit a single patient.[11][12] On 12 October 2020 amidst a rise in cases in Northern England, the hospital was placed on readiness to receive patients, but again did not.[13] In January 2021 NHS England admitted that it would not be admitting any patients into the specially created hospital.[14] Later the same month it was announced that the hospital was to become instead a mass vaccination centre.[14] On 31 March 2022 the hospital was closed for the final time.[15] On 25 January 2021, Go North East introduced a bus route branded ConnectorShuttle which operated between Concord bus station and the Nightingale Hospital. The service connected with bus route 56 at the bus station.[16]","Title":"NHS Nightingale Hospital North East - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11322","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Nightingale_Hospital_North_East"}
