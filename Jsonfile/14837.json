The Commandos were later trained in parachuting at Agra, India and they performed their maiden display during Army Day celebrations on 10 October 1980. 4 December 1980, the Squadron moved to its new premises in Ganemulla. In 1981 the Commandos were employed in counter terrorist operations in Jaffna for the first time. It also performs special duties in the Presidential Security Division. To meet the operational requirements the Commando Regiment was expanded and a Commando Brigade was formed on 18 March 1997.4 Commando regiment was formed before the 3 Commando Regiment on 15 March 2003 which is responsible for VIP protection, hostage rescue and anti terrorist tasks and war dog operations.

The Regimental Headquarter which includes the Regimental Centre and the Regimental Headquarter Battalion handles administration and welfare while the four regular battalions are organised into the Commando Brigade (CDO BDE) which comes under the operational command of I Corps.[4] Current CR roles are believed to include  With the commencement of the 4th phase of the Sri Lankan Civil War (often cited as 4th Eelam war), the Commandos and Special Forces were tasked to conduct deep operations to disrupt and deny the freedom of action of LTTE. Commandos were able to disorientate the LTTE Leadership by conducting Ambushes and Raids by inflicting attrition on LTTE, thus forcing them to deploy more troops for their rear area security. Their operations shaped up the battlefield creating a favorable situation to launch a historical major offensive to liberate Eastern Province from LTTE. Most of the operations conducted by the Commando Regiment are Covert operations. A successful small group raid was done in 1990 In Mallakam in the Jaffna peninsula. By Delta Patrol of 1st Commando Regiment. Another successful raid was done in Welioya Thannimuruppu Kulam area in 1993 by a small team of Bravo Group of 2nd Commando Regiment. LTTE's Colonel Amudan alias Thambi (tag no 0003) was also killed in 1994 creating a great impact on the chain of command of the LTTE. The Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) is a covert operation (black ops) unit of the Sri Lanka Army. This unit is operated under the Directorate of Military Intelligence of the Army and it is believed to be composed of personnel from the Commando Regiment and Special Forces Regiment. The 3rd Commando Regiment participated in the military offensive which was launched to capture the Thoppigala (Baron's Cap) from LTTE during the period of June/July 2007. They managed to seize the rocky plateau which had been named by the LTTE as Tora Bora. Around 200 LTTE cadres were killed during the entire offensive.[7] After a successful operation to capture Vakarai and Sampur by the Special Forces Brigade, the Commandos were tasked to capture the LTTE strongholds around Thoppigala and Narakamulla. Gaining control of the A\u20135 road which runs from Maha Oya to Batticaloa via Chenkaladi was essential to gaining access to the jungles of Thoppigala. From Pullumale to Black Bridge at Chenkalladi road was totally controlled by the LTTE. Further, the LTTE was operating freely in the jungles between the A−27 and A−5 roads. Hence, it was essential to gain control of this portion of the road and in the jungles, to launch an operation to destroy the bastion of Thoppigala. However, the A-27 road which runs from Maha Oya to Potuvil and the road from Trikonamadu to Kalmunai were controlled by the Army but was vulnerable to the LTTE attacks. After finalizing plans for a major operation, the mobilization of assigned troops commenced in preparation for launching a decisive attack against LTTE strongholds in the theatre. However, intelligence revealed that the LTTE planned to destroy the Unnichchai tank bund if the Security Forces launched an operation to gain control over the area. They intended to inundate the area by destroying the tank bund to destabilize the government and ultimately spoil the security forces' plan. In this backdrop, commandos were tasked to capture the Unichchai Tank bund intact to facilitate the major offensive. The capture of Unnichchai tank bund was one of the most significant raids conducted by commandos to facilitate break out of the major offensive to capture the LTTE stronghold Thoppigala.[citation needed]","Title":"Sri Lanka Army Commando Regiment - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14837","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Army_Commando_Regiment"}
