{"Content: ":"A jugular foramen is one of the two (left and right) large foramina (openings) in the base of the skull, located behind the carotid canal. It is formed by the temporal bone and the occipital bone. It allows many structures to pass, including the inferior petrosal sinus, three cranial nerves, the sigmoid sinus, and meningeal arteries. The jugular foramen is formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and behind by the occipital bone.[1] It is generally slightly larger on the right side than on the left side. The jugular foramen may be subdivided into three compartments, each with their own contents. An alternative imaging based subclassification exists, delineated by the jugular spine which is a bony ridge partially separating the jugular foramen into two parts: Obstruction of the jugular foramen can result in jugular foramen syndrome.[2][3] Jugular foramen Base of the skull.
