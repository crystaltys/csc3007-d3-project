However, he was not appointed to the said post.[5] In 2012, he was nominated as chief justice to replace Renato Corona[6] but the post eventually went to Associate Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. Locsin was designated as the Philippines' permanent representative to the United Nations by President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017. It was announced that he accepted the appointment on September 18, 2016.[7] His term officially began when he presented his credentials to Ant√≥nio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, on April 19, 2017.[8] Under his leadership, the Philippines voted to abstain from the challenge against the legality of the Independent Expert on SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) at a November 2016 session.[9] Also, the Philippines was among 10 nations that voted against a UN resolution urging Myanmar to end its military campaign against Rohingya Muslims living in the Rakhine state in November 2017.[10] Additionally, the country was one of 35 nations to abstain on the UN vote to declare the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital null and void during an emergency December 2017 session of the UN General Assembly.[10] In March 2018, Locsin submitted the country's letter of withdrawal from the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC, after President Duterte expressed his intent to withdraw from the court.[10] Locsin vacated the post of permanent representative of the Philippines to the United Nations on October 12, 2018, upon assuming the post of foreign affairs secretary. On October 11, 2018, Locsin announced that President Rodrigo Duterte offered him the post of secretary of foreign affairs, which was held by Alan Peter Cayetano.

He has been criticised[by whom?] for his controversial use of social media.[13] He is against the use of Filipino languages such as Tagalog in debates, preferring English.[citation needed] Locsin has found himself at the center of various controversial public statements via the social media platform Twitter. In late March 2016, he was chastised by internet users over his Twitter comments calling the Tagalog language \"inappropriate to pointed debate\" during the Visayas leg of PiliPinas Debates 2016.[14] He later defended his comments concerning the use of Tagalog in debates.[15] Locsin expressed support for the Philippine Drug War on August 21, 2017, through Twitter, comparing the campaign against drugs of President Duterte to Adolf Hitler's Final Solution and said he does not believe in the rehabilitation of drug addicts.[16] He followed this with another remark that the \"Nazis were not all wrong\" and said people should keep an open mind drawing criticism.[17] He cited Hitler's military and economic policies that \"are paying off even now in German primacy in Europe\" but conceded that the Holocaust \"wiped out his economic contribution.\"[17] Locsin later retracted these remarks by deleting the tweet, however threatened individuals who criticized him.[16] On February 20, 2017, the majority bloc members of the House of Representatives caucused to remove rape from the list of possible death penalty offenses.[18] When the official Twitter account of the ABS-CBN News Channel reported this, Locsin tweeted a reply:[19] Locsin in a tweet said that while rape is a crime; an \"indignity\" and \"outrage\" it is not a heinous crime. Though he went on to mention select cases of rape as \"heinous\" such as a gang rape in India and an incident where the rapist is an ugly man. He then said that killing is not heinous or premeditated saying it's a common crime. His posts were criticized by some users of Twitter.[19] On February 14, 2018, Locsin tweeted that criticizers of the Chinese names imposed by China on the Philippine Rise, which have been recognized by the International Hydrographic Organization, are 'childish and stupid', sparking a word war on the issue. Criticizers noted that Locsin is the current ambassador to the United Nations and should be one of the first to defend the Philippines' sovereignty and sovereign rights.
