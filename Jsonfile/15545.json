{"Content: ":"Protests broke out in the autonomous region of Karakalpakstan in Uzbekistan on 1 July 2022 over proposed amendments by Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the Uzbek President, to the Constitution of Uzbekistan, which would have ended Karakalpakstan's status as an autonomous region of Uzbekistan and right to secede from Uzbekistan via referendum. A day after protests had begun in the Karakalpak capital of Nukus, President Mirziyoyev withdrew the constitutional amendments. The Karakalpak government said that protesters had attempted to storm government buildings.[6] Despite concessions given by the Uzbek government in preserving Karakalpakstan's autonomy, protests continued growing, resulting in internet blockage throughout Karakalpakstan on 2 July,[7] and President Mirziyoyev declaring a state of emergency in the region.[8] The protests were quelled by the morning of 3 July.[1] The state of emergency was lifted on July 21.[9] Karakalpakstan is an autonomous republic located in western Uzbekistan and is home to ethnic Karakalpaks, Turkic-speaking peoples who speak Kipchak languages numbering to just approximately 752,000 or 2.2% of Uzbekistan's population.[10] Throughout the course of history, the territory of Karakalpakstan had been under control of various empires before forming its own present-day identity in around the 17th century as a separate confederation of nomadic tribes initially belonging to Kazakh Khanate,[11] thus resulting in Karakalpaks having closer cultural ties with the Kazakhs in terms of customs, material culture, and language contrary with the Uzbeks.[12][13] Following the establishment of the Soviet Union, the process of boundary delimitation took place under Joseph Stalin in Central Asia by the local communist organizations under the influence of ethnic nationalist intellectuals and were made on the basis of late Tsarist and early Soviet census data.[14] As new borders were drawn, bilingualism and multinational identities in the areas were common while the divisions of language and ethnicity was often seen by the urban\u2013rural political divide.[14] The Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast was formed in 1925 within the Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic and was transferred to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic where in 1932, it became the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and was fully integrated into the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936 where it retained its status quo as an autonomy.[13] In December 1990, during Perestroika, the Supreme Council of Karakalpak ASSR adopted a \"Declaration on State Sovereignty\" over the Soviet Union which it allowed for Karakalpakstan to gain independence through the means of a referendum while the Uzbek SSR had declared its own independence in August 1991 shortly after the failed Soviet coup d'Ã©tat attempt.[15] By that time, Karakalpakstan was recognized by the central Soviet government as holding a \"state status\" and, in November 1991, Dauletbay Shamshetov [ru] was elected the first president of Karakalpakstan by the Supreme Council before eventually stepping down in June 1992.[16] After the dissolution of the Soviet Union took place, the Republic of Karakalpakstan was formed in January 1992,[17] and subsequently became an autonomous republic under the Uzbek authority the adoption of the Constitution of Uzbekistan in December 1992.[18] In 1993, a 20-year period interstate agreement on the entry of the Republic of Karakalpakstan into Uzbekistan was signed by both governments which granted the right of Karakalpakstan to secede from Uzbekistan through a referendum. By the time the agreement expired in 2013, it was largely forgotten.[19] The Aral Sea was historically a part of Karakalpak culture, and the region is commonly associated with its draining.[20] As a result of the draining of the Aral Sea, Karakalpakstan became one of Uzbekistan's poorest regions,[21] and living conditions have worsened as a result of decreased access to drinking water and the spread of infectious disease.[22] The continued decreasing habitability of Karakalpakstan as a result of the Aral Sea's draining has also caused a significant decrease in economic opportunities, and many within the region have blamed the draining for the worsening situation in the region.[23] In late June 2022, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev proposed 170 amendments to the constitution of Uzbekistan, to be voted on in a referendum. Among the most controversial amendments were an amendment changing the length of a presidential term from five to seven years, as well as a removal of term limits, and amendments which would significantly decrease Karakalpakstan's autonomy, including removing their right to secede from Uzbekistan via referendum.[24] On 1 July 2022, thousands of people protested against the proposed constitutional amendments in the Karakalpak capital of Nukus and throughout the region. The news outlet Turkmen.News reported that the Uzbekistan National Guard presence had been strengthened in two towns in Karakalpakstan as a result of protests. The cause of other protests was reported by Eurasianet to be the arrest of Dauletmurat Tazhimuratov, a Karakalpak lawyer and journalist, before he was set to meet people in Nukus.[25] The day after protests, Mirziyoyev agreed to withdraw the amendments to the constitution regarding Karakalpakstan's autonomy.[26] At the same time, the government of Karakalpakstan claimed that protesters had attempted to storm government buildings.[27] Internet access in Karakalpakstan was subsequently blocked,[28] and a state of emergency was declared in the region by the Uzbek government.[29] By 4 July 2022, opposition politician Pulat Ahunov noted that the situation appeared to have stabilised following the state of emergency and the imposition of a curfew by the government of Uzbekistan,[3] but simultaneously expressed concerns that the unrest could escalate into an ethnic conflict between Uzbeks and Karakalpaks, saying \"Overall, I think that the situation is starting to stabilise, but there is another kind of danger. There have been incidents of ethnic clashes between the Karakalpaks and the Uzbeks. ... It will not be about the status of Karakalpakstan, it will be about a conflict between the Karakalpaks and the Uzbeks.\"[30] Through the weekend of 1\u20132 July 2022, Mirziyoyev visited Karakalpakstan twice,[30] and publicly castigated Karakalpak pro-government figures for not telling him about public opposition to the laws beforehand.[3] Following a 4 July meeting with Karakalpak deputies, he claimed that the leaders of the protests had attempted to take control of local government buildings in order to obtain weaponry, also saying, \"Taking advantage of their numerical superiority, these men attacked law enforcement officers, severely beating them and inflicting severe injuries.\"[30] According to Mirziyoyev, he held a meeting with President of the European Council Charles Michel in which an independent investigation into the unrest was discussed. He once again blamed \"criminal gangs\" for violence.[3] There have been widespread concerns regarding the possibility of many casualties as a result of the protests.[30][31] President Mirziyoyev has admitted that casualties have occurred among both civilians and security forces, claiming that rioters had carried out \"destructive actions\". Pulat Ahunov told Reuters that at least five people have died.[32] Sultanbek Ziyayev, minister of health in Karakalpakstan, said Nukus hospitals were filled with protesters who had been injured in clashes with security forces, and that \"thousands\" had been hospitalised.[4] On 4 July, the General Prosecutor's Office of Uzbekistan reported that 18 people had been killed and 243 injured in Nukus, though opposition figures have stated the true number is likely far higher.[3][33] On July 18, the Prosecutor's Office announced that three more people had died in hospital.[2] Uzbekistan National Guard spokesperson Davron Jumanazarov stated that a total of 516 people had been detained on 1\u20132 July.[5] According to Amnesty International, security forces allegedly fired rubber bullets into the crowd and there were unverified reports of drones dropping smoke bombs and tear gas on the protesters. Amnesty International said authorities had confirmed the use of smoke bombs and tear gas.[34] A video circulated on social media purportedly showed a large amount of blood on the street in Nukus. It was later claimed by local media that the red colour in the video was the result of red-dye water cannons sprayed by police.[35][36] However, Amnesty International has noted that it remains impossible to verify the video and whether or not it was blood, as a result of internet blackouts.[37] Polish journalist Agnieszka Pikulicka also shared the video but later apologized for spreading fake news.[38] According to Reuters, the protests were the deadliest since the 2005 Andijan massacre, in which 173 were killed according to government estimates.[3]","Title":"2022 Karakalpak protests - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15545","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Karakalpak_protests"}
