He was made a cardinal in 2010. Ranjith previously served as auxiliary bishop of Colombo (1991\u20131995), Bishop of Ratnapura (1995\u20132001), Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (2001\u20132004), Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor (2004\u20132005), and Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (2005\u20132009). The eldest of four children,[1] Malcolm Ranjith was born in Polgahawela to Don William and Mary Winifreeda. He studied at De La Salle College in Mutwal before entering St. Aloysius Seminary in Borella in 1965. From 1966 to 1970 he pursued studies in theology and philosophy at the National seminary in Kandy. He was thereafter sent by the then Archbishop Thomas Cooray to further his priestly studies in Rome. He graduated from the Pontifical Urbanian University with a Bachelor of Theology (B.Th.) degree. On 29 June 1975, Malcolm Ranjith was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI in St. Peter's Square. Later he joined the tutorial staff of St. Thomas' College, Kotte,[2] before pursuing post graduate studies at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, from where he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1978; his thesis centered on the Epistle to the Hebrews. During his time at the Biblical Institute, he studied under Carlo Martini and Albert Vanhoye (both future cardinals), He also attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he undertook scriptural research as a postgraduate student.[citation needed] Upon his return to Sri Lanka, Ranjith became an assistant parish priest in Pamunugama in 1978, later serving as a parish priest in Payagala and Kalutara. His pastoral work among the poor but religious people in these fishing villages led him to become involved with social justice. He also established \"Seth Sarana\", a center for relief of the poor in the Archdiocese of Colombo. He once said that \"love for the liturgy and love for the poor ... have been the compass of my life as a priest.\" In 1983, Ranjith was named the National Director of Pontifical Mission Societies. He revived the Society of the Holy Childhood and, as Diocesan Co-ordinator for Human Development, he introduced bold initiatives in areas such as housing, fisheries, and various self-employment projects. On 17 June 1991, Ranjith was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo and Titular Bishop of Cabarsussi. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 31 August from Archbishop Nicholas Marcus Fernando, with Bishops Thomas Savundaranayagam and Oswald Gomis serving as co-consecrators. He served as the Vicar General in charge of Parochial Apostolate and Lay Apostolate from 1991 to 1995. His peers elected him the Secretary General of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka as well. He was Chairman of the Organising Committee for the Beatification of Ven. Joseph Vaz and the visit of Pope John Paul II to Sri Lanka in January 1995. In 1994, Ranjith led a commission that denounced the theological work of Sri Lankan theologian Tissa Balasuriya. He charged that he had questioned original sin and the divinity of Christ, as well as supporting women's ordination. Ranjith was supported by then-Cardinal Ratzinger, who backed his position.[3] Ranjith was appointed bishop by the Holy See to the newly created Diocese of Ratnapura, taking office on 2 November 1995. His appointment was hailed as a welcome spark to kindle the fire of missionary zeal in the hearts of the clergy and laity in his diocese.[citation needed] Ranjith promoted inter-faith dialogue in Sri Lanka, as he believes it can eliminate potential causes of tensions and disagreements between the religious and ethnic groups that make up the country. He once said that \"dialogue is vital and fundamental and as Catholics we must celebrate the richness of the Word of God incarnate in our life, families and communities\".[citation needed] Ranjith is also the first Sri Lankan Bishop to be appointed to the Holy See's civil service. On 1 October 2001, he was named Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and simultaneously appointed President of the Pontifical Mission Societies by Pope John Paul II. It is the Pope's ministry for the coordination of the missionary efforts of the Church and involves overview and growth of the local Churches in mission countries. This Ministry coordinates over 1100 Archdioceses, Dioceses, Apostolic Vicarates and Apostolic Prefectures as well as Sui Juris Missions. The Adjunct Secretary is the President of the Pontifical Mission Societies, which are the instruments of the Pope for enhancing support through prayer and contributions for the mission of the Church.[citation needed] Ranjith is the first Sri Lankan bishop to be appointed an Apostolic Nuncio. He was appointed titular archbishop of Umbriatico and the Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and to East Timor on 29 April 2004.[4] During his tenure as Apostolic Nuncio he was instrumental in enhancing mutual relations between the Holy See and Indonesia. He won the admiration of the Church hierarchy for the important role he played in assisting the establishment of cordial relations between the local Churches and government authorities, whilst ensuring respect for the rights of the local Catholic Church throughout the country. Ranjith was appointed secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on 10 December 2005.[5] He once described the liturgical reforms inspired by the Second Vatican Council as \"a mixed bag of results\". While praising the use of vernacular languages, he also criticized the \"quasi total abandonment\" of Latin and the \"acceptance of all kinds of 'novelties' resulting from a secularizing and humanistic theological and liturgical mindset overtaking the West\". He has also lamented the \"banalization and obscuring of the mystical and sacred aspects of the liturgy in many areas of the Church in the name of a so-called Konzilsgeist (spirit of the Council)\".[citation needed] Ranjith opposes the reception of Communion in the hand and standing, once saying, \"I think it is high time to ... abandon the current practice that was not called for by Sacrosanctum Concilium, nor by Fathers, but was only accepted after its illegitimate introduction in some countries.\"[6] A staunch supporter of the Tridentine Mass, Ranjith once said that bishops who opposed Summorum Pontificum were allowing themselves to be \"used as instruments of the devil,\" accusing them of \"disobedience ... and even rebellion against the Pope.\"[7] He once said, \"I'm not a fan of the Lefebvrians ... but what they sometimes say about the liturgy they say for good reason.\"[8] Ranjith is fluent in ten languages namely; Italian, French, German, Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, Latin, English, Sinhala and Tamil. On 16 June 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Metropolitan Archbishop of Colombo, naming Joseph Di Noia to replace him at the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.[9] In a letter to Archbishop Ranjith, Pope Benedict said, \"I wish to express my sincere thanks for the fidelity, the commitment and competence with which you exercised that [Divine Worship secretary] office.\" Pope Benedict also expressed that \"we have reason to be encouraged by the good you will be able to perform among the peoples of your land.\"[10] Ranjith was among 34 metropolitan archbishops to receive his pallium from Pope Benedict on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June 2009.[11] He was greeted with warmth and solemnity upon his arrival in Sri Lanka on 31 July 2009. Upon his arrival he was received by the President of Sri Lanka, such high-profile reception being due to the status of the Archbishops of Colombo as leaders (Metropolites) of the Catholic community in the country. Ranjith took possession of his see in a private ceremony on 5 August 2009 and celebrated the Mass for the beginning of his pastoral ministry as archbishop of Colombo on 8 August 2009. On 7 October 2009, Ranjith issued new liturgical guidelines in his diocese. These include a recommendation for \"all faithful, including the religious, to receive Holy Communion reverently kneeling and on the tongue\", as well as laymen being forbidden from preaching.[12] In addition to this, priests are forbidden to bring elements or styles of worship from other religions into the liturgy. In April 2010, Archbishop Ranjith was elected president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka. On 20 October 2010, Pope Benedict XVI announced he would make Ranjith a cardinal at a consistory scheduled for 20 November 2010.[13] On that day Ranjith was made cardinal priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina. On 13 February 2011 he took possession of his titular church in Rome. Ranjith participated as a cardinal-elector in the 2013 conclave which elected Pope Francis.[14] Ranjith is a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.[15]","Title":"Malcolm Ranjith - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12639","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Ranjith"}
