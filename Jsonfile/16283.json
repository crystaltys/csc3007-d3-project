{"Content: ":"Russia The 2022 Ukrainian coup d'état attempt refers to a failed attempt by Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to overthrow the Ukrainian government and install a pro-Russian rule in various Ukrainian cities for the further surrender of cities to the Russian Army during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian intelligence agency FSB and recruited ATO veterans was to carry out the coup at the beginning of 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, however, coup plan was ultimately cancelled due to the fact that people who were set to participate in coup were detained by Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).[1][4] The planning of the coup began no later than the summer of 2021. According to detained agent, who was set to participate in coup, at the beginning of Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia was set to send an appeal to the current Ukrainian authorities, in which Russia calls on the Ukrainian authorities to surrender and if Ukraine refuses to do this, recruited pro-Russian agents will stage a coup.[1] First, they were set to stage an incidents in both Kyiv and Ukraine-Transnistria border, creating a pretext for invasion.[5] Then, following the start of invasion, agents were set to begin seizure of administrative buildings in various Ukrainian cities, followed by the installation of pro-Russian leadership in them, surrender and transfer of Ukrainian cities to Russian troops.[1][4] During the coup, mass riots, fights with law enforcement officers and terrorist attacks to destabilize the situation also was to take place.[6][7] Use of fake blood during riots was also planned.[8] After the coup, the Verkhovna Rada was to be dissolved and replaced by a pro-Russian People's Rada, which was to play the role of a pro-Russian puppet government on the occupied territory of Ukraine and the newly created People's republics in Western Ukraine.[1][4] Pro-Russian president also was set to be installed in Ukraine following the coup.[9][10] The plan was eventually cancelled due to the fact that the organizer and key persons of the coup were detained by the SBU in early March in the Ivano-Frankivsk and Khmelnytskyi Oblasts.[1] The Russian Foreign Ministry called statements about coup \"disinformation\", and accused the UK and NATO of \"escalating tensions\" around Ukraine, while Russian diplomatic department stated that \"We strongly urge London to stop stupid rhetorical provocations, which are very dangerous in the current heated situation, and to contribute to real diplomatic efforts to ensure reliable guarantees of European security.\"[11] Ukrainian politician Yevhen Murayev, who, according to Sky News, was being considered as a potential candidate as a new leader of Ukraine, dismissed the allegation as \"nonsense\".[12]","Title":"2022 Ukrainian coup d'état attempt - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16283","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Ukrainian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt"}
