{"Content: ":"The MTV Europe Music Awards (originally named MTV European Music Awards, commonly abbreviated as MTV EMA) are awards presented by Paramount International Networks to honour artists and music in pop culture.[citation needed] It was originally conceived as an alternative to the MTV Video Music Awards, which are hosted annually in the United States. The Europe Music Awards are held every year in a different country; it has been hosted mostly in the United Kingdom. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest.

The song \"So What?\" is known for its amount of expletives and references to bestiality among many other controversial lyrics while \"Last Caress\" has lyrics pertaining to murder and rape. As a result of their performance Metallica's performance and references to Metallica have been removed from future broadcasts of the ceremony. 1997: U2 opened the show performing \"Mofo\" dressed in boxing gowns.

Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the tee shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong. You've got a voice and you have got to do what you can about it allright?\"[7] Fred Durst took the stage with Wes Scantlin and Jimmy Page to perform the classic Led Zeppelin's song \"Thank You\". 2002: One of the highlights was the offer made by host Puff Daddy giving away a lush ring to the first woman to undress on stage.

Kelly responded by calling Aguilera's music \"crap\" and saying she was a \"cow.\" Later, a skit was aired of Christina Aguilera throwing darts at a board decorated with a picture of Kelly Osbourne. This irked the Ozzy offspring, who voiced her disapproval when she came onstage to present an award. Kelly stated, \"If Christina Aguilera has to resort to throwing darts at my head after everything she's achieved and everything she's done, then she's a really sad, sorry person\". Aguilera later retorted with a voice of mock sympathy, saying \"Honey, if you can dish it out, you've got to learn how to take it back\".[8] During Travis' performance of \"The Beautiful Occupation\" an assembly of nude protesters marched onstage with signs that covered their naughty bits. At the end of the song, they lifted the signs. While near at the end of performing \"Baby Boy\", Beyoncé and Sean Paul both were up on stage when their backing track suffered a technical difficulty. This went on for a near minute in which both artist and dancers exited the stage while the error went on. This also left confusion among presenter Christina Aguilera, who walked on stage to continue hosting which ended the backing track error. Both artists later decided to retake the performance again. The retake would later replace re-airings of the show and would be the first show to extend time with this retake. 2004: The show was held at Tor di Valle Racecourse in Rome. The outdoor stage was situated in front of the Colosseum, where artists such as Eminem, Franz Ferdinand, Beastie Boys, and Anastacia performed to an attendance of over 400,000 people.

British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen entertained the audience with his English-mangling character Borat and poked fun at Madonna who was at the time trying to adopt an African child adding: \"My only concern is that this singing transvestite will not be such a good father.\" Despite winning the award for Best Hip-Hop, Kanye West apparently was so disappointed at not winning for Best Video that he crashed the stage when the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for \"We Are Your Friends\". In a tirade riddled with expletives, Kanye West said he should have won the prize for his video \"Touch the Sky\", because it \"cost a million dollars, Pamela Anderson was in it.
