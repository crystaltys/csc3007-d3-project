{"Content: ":"Télécoms Sans Frontières (TSF) is an emergency technology non-governmental organization, which intervenes in the context of humanitarian crises, conflict zones and areas hit by natural disasters to set up satellite communication for the affected populations and humanitarian organisations. During different humanitarian experiences throughout the first Gulf War, and the Balkan war between 1991 and 1997, TSF\u2019s founders realised that in addition to healthcare and food there was a real need for telecommunications in emergency contexts. To meet this need, TSF was founded in 1998 and officially started its operations in the field with its first mission during the Kosovo War to offer satellite phone calls to the refugees fleeing the conflict. During the following years, TSF expanded its operations supporting also the actors working in the aftermath of humanitarian crises. In 2001 the first telecommunication centre was established in Afghanistan to help international NGOs active in the area with satellite internet communication systems. Between 2003 and 2006 TSF opened two regional offices in Thailand and Nicaragua (the current regional office for the Americas opened in Mexico in 2016) and became a partner of two international clusters in humanitarian aid: the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) and the Emergency Telecoms Cluster (ETC) founded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and supervised by UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (currently ETC is led by the World Food Programme). TSF has its headquarters in Pau (France) and two regional offices in Bangkok (Thailand) and Guadalajara (Mexico). Two TSF representatives are also located in Washington, D.C., and London to support TSF\u2019s partnership development activities. The governance of the organisation is ensured by a Board of Directors, which defines and approves the strategic direction and the financial budgets. It ensures that TSF's actions are in line with the mission and the values of TSF. The members of the Board are: TSF\u2019s main areas of intervention include disaster response, capacity building, education, bridging the digital divide and protection and assistance.
