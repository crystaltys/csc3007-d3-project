Tony Randel knew one of Paul Sorvino\u2019s daughters, and we offered Paul a script. Unbeknownst to us, he accepted and did the film for minimal money because he always wanted to play Bela Lugosi! We never knew that, but he\u2019s talked about that in several interviews. It was serendipity.\"[2] The film won the Best Feature Comedy Film Award at the 20th annual International Family Film Festival (IFFF) in Santa Clarita, California.[1]","Title":"Hybrids (2015 film) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18666","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrids_(2015_film)"}
