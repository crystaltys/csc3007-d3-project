{"Content: ":"On July 24, 2022, a mass shooting took place at the Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, leaving three people dead and three others injured including the assailant.[5][4][7][8] The attacker successfully targeted former mayor Rose Furigay of Lamitan, Basilan, who was attending her daughter's graduation at the university. About an hour before the attack, a graduation ceremony was scheduled to be conducted for the School of Law students of the Ateneo de Manila University.[9] The perpetrator was able to enter the campus through a GrabTaxi with his weapons left unchecked despite the imposition of a gun ban as part of the heightened security for Philippine President Bongbong Marcos's State of the Nation Address the following day.[10][11] He later blended with the crowd and waited for his target to appear.[1] While homicide rates are high in the Philippines, mass shootings \u2013 particularly school shootings \u2013 are not common.[12][13] However, politically-motivated crimes are prevalent.[13][12] Federico Pascual Jr., a columnist at The Philippine Star, opined that \"the Ateneo incident could be described as a mass shooting\" but the Quezon City police said that the gunman \"was targeting Furigay, with other victims presumably just collateral damage.\"[14] At around 3:30 p.m.[a] (local time), on July 24, 2022, a gunman opened fire outside the university's Aret√© building, the venue for the graduation ceremony.[7] Former Lamitan (Basilan) Mayor Rose (sometimes called \"Rosita\") Furigay, was the main target of the perpetrator.[15] She was killed along with a security guard, Jeneven Bandiola, who was attempting to thwart the gunman,[16] and Victor George Capistrano, Furigay's executive assistant.[4] In an aftermath video, students and university officials were seen fleeing and screaming while others take care of the victims.[17] The assailant escaped the crime scene by taking possession of a vehicle owned by a certain Mr. Palma, which was threatened by the gunman.[18][3] After making it to Aurora Boulevard and crashing through several vehicles, he was blocked by a group of people.[2] He tried to flee again on foot and later, boarded a public utility mini-bus but he was eventually arrested by responding police officers as they stopped the mini-bus and demanded that the suspect to get off.[19][2] The police officers were tipped off by motorcycle riders that the suspect boarded public transportation.[19] Three people were killed in the attack: former Lamitan mayor Rosita \"Rose\" Furigay, Victor George Capistrano (Furigay's aide), and Jeneven Bandiala (an Ateneo security guard).[20] Hannah Furigay, the former mayor's daughter who was among the graduating students was injured.[21] A nurse named Julia Manabat is another individual who was injured.[22] The attacker was also wounded by a gunshot from an unknown shooter[5] but later, it was determined that security guards injured the assailant.[3] Chao-Tiao Yumol, a doctor and a resident of Lamitan was identified as the suspected attacker.[8] According to the police, Yumol admitted to being the one who carried out the shooting incident.[23][24][25] He had no permanent residence in Metro Manila and was always on the run to carry out the assassination.[2] In 2018, a cease and desist order was issued to Yumol's clinic in Lamitan by the Bangsamoro government.[26] Yumol was also the subject of more than 70 cyberlibel complaints filed by the Furigays over his accusations of their involvement in the drug trade[27] and corruption.[28] The lawyer of the Furigays denied these allegations by Yumol.[29] The police further said that the lone suspected gunman committed the crime due to \"personal motives\" as he had a long history of conflict with the Furigays.[6] Several organizations and public personalities condemned the incident.[30] President Marcos demanded an immediate investigation into the shooting.[31] However, the perpetrator, Chao-Tiao Yumol, was a vocal supporter of President Marcos and former president Rodrigo Duterte on social media.[32] Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte denounced the shooting, stating that \"this kind of incident has no place in our society and must be condemned to the highest level\" while extending condolences to the victims' families.[4] The Philippine Red Cross dispatched eight bags of blood to the QMMC where the injured victims were recovering.[33] The Ateneo de Manila University canceled the graduation ceremony for its law school students scheduled to occur hours after the shooting and pledged to assist any students, faculty, staff, and guests affected by the incident.[34] The university's administration assured the public that \"its campuses are safe\" and that its security protocols \"are being reviewed and strengthened further.\"[35] Members of the Ateneo de Manila community also pledged to provide financial support to Bandiala's family and have launched a QR code payment donation channel.[36] Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, the invited commencement speaker, was in transit at the time of the shooting and \"was advised to turn back.\"[37] According to Supreme Court spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka, the chief justice was safe.[38] On July 25, 2022, a day after the shooting, the Quezon City Police District of the National Capital Region Police Office charged Chao Tiao Yumol with three counts of murder and attempted murder (on Hannah Furigay) before the city prosecutor's office. Yumol was also charged with motor vehicle theft and malicious mischief worth \u20b180,000 (around US$1,430).[39]","Title":"Ateneo de Manila University shooting - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16964","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateneo_de_Manila_shooting"}
