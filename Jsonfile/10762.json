{"Content: ":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. state of Illinois on January 24, 2020, when a woman in Chicago, who had just returned from the pandemic's place of origin in Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive for the virus.[4] This was the second case of COVID-19 in the United States during the pandemic. The woman's husband was diagnosed with the disease a few days later, the first known case of human-to-human transmission in the United States. Community transmission was not suspected until March 8, when a case with no connection to other cases or recent travel was confirmed.[5] In mid-March, as the number of known cases rose into the double digits, Governor J. B. Pritzker issued a disaster proclamation, the state's equivalent of a state of emergency, to respond to the crisis. The state took measures to halt the spread of the disease by closing all schools and colleges, ordering a stop to eviction enforcements, ordering all bars and restaurants closed to sit-in diners, and otherwise restricting large gatherings of people. As the virus spread further, the state enacted an even stronger shelter in place order, affecting schools and businesses across the state.[6] At first declared between the dates of March 21 and April 7, the order was later extended until April 30, then May 29.[7][8][9] During December 2020, Illinois experienced the second highest number of deaths per week, ranking fifth per capita. This crisis has spurred calls for Governor Pritzker to respond to the pandemic more aggressively.[10][11] As of January 2021, Illinois has the fifth highest number of confirmed cases in the United States.[10] As of May 26, 2021[update], Illinois has administered 11,049,665 COVID-19 vaccine doses. 49% of the population has been fully vaccinated.[12] On January 24, 2020, Illinois health officials announced the first confirmed case the novel coronavirus infection in the state of Illinois, also the second confirmed case in the United States. The case was a woman in her 60s who had returned from a December 25 \u2013 January 13 visit to Wuhan, China, the place of origin of the outbreak, where she had frequently visited a hospitalized relative and other relatives with respiratory illnesses.[13] She began to experience symptoms after returning to Chicago, and was isolated at St. Alexius Medical Center in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates.[14] On January 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that the first known human-to-human transmission in the U.S. of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (then known as 2019-nCoV) had occurred in Chicago. According to the CDC, the woman who was the first Illinois case had transmitted the virus to her husband, who was confirmed as the second Illinois case and the sixth U.S. case after testing positive. He was isolated at the same hospital as his wife.[15] On February 7, the two Illinois cases were released from the hospital and began home isolation.[16] Both made full recoveries and were released from isolation on February 14.[17][18] On February 29, a third Illinois resident tested positive for the virus in suburban Cook County.[19] On March 2, a fourth case was announced by Illinois officials, the wife of the third case; she subsequently began home isolation. Other details were announced by officials: her husband had been isolated at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights since his case was reported two days earlier; both were in their 70s. The couple was possibly exposed to the virus through community transmission, with recent travel to Palm Springs.[20] The man was later released to home isolation.[21][22] On March 5, public health officials in Chicago reported a fifth case of coronavirus in a man in his 20s. The man, a student at Vanderbilt University,[23] recently traveled to Italy to study abroad, and returned to Illinois on a flight to Chicago O'Hare International Airport. The new case was hospitalized at Rush University Medical Center.[24] On March 6, a sixth case was reported in Chicago. The patient, a classroom assistant in the Vaughn Occupational High School, had been on the Grand Princess cruise ship where multiple passengers had tested positive.[25] On March 8, a seventh case was announced in Cook County. The man in his 60s had not traveled to an area impacted by coronavirus, and did not have any contact with other cases; as a result, Illinois officials reported the patient as the first evidence of community transmission within Illinois. He was also reported to be in serious condition.[26] Additionally, a Missouri case connected to Illinois was confirmed; the patient had returned from Italy on a flight to O'Hare Airport, then took an Amtrak train to St. Louis, where she tested positive.[27] On March 9, four additional cases were announced in Cook County, bringing the state's total number of cases to eleven. Two of the new cases were family members of the classroom aide diagnosed on March 6; the two others included a California resident who traveled to Illinois, and a woman who had returned from an Egyptian cruise which was linked to many COVID-19 cases.[28] In response to the growing number of cases in the state and the country, Governor J. B. Pritzker announced a disaster proclamation (a state of emergency) for the state of Illinois.[29] On March 10, Governor Pritzker announced eight new presumptive positive cases, two of which were the first cases outside of Cook County (in Kane and McHenry Counties). These cases brought Illinois's total number of cases to 19.[30] On March 11, six new cases of the coronavirus were reported by officials, including the first in Lake County, bringing the total to 25.[31] One of these cases was located at One Prudential Plaza, marking the first confirmed case in a major downtown Chicago office building.[32] Illinois colleges and universities, such as Northwestern University and the University of Illinois, announced measures to combat the spread of the virus on their campuses through extensions of Spring Break as well as implementing online classes for part or all of the remaining semester.[33][34] In response to the growing pandemic, both Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders canceled campaign rallies planned for Illinois. Additionally, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot canceled the city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade and Chicago River dyeing in response to coronavirus.[35] On March 12, seven new cases of the coronavirus were reported by officials, including the first child who tested positive in Illinois. This brought the total to 32.[36] On March 13, fourteen new cases of the coronavirus were reported by officials, bringing the total to 46. Governor Pritzker announced statewide school closures beginning March 17 until March 30.[37] Casinos statewide would close for fourteen days beginning on March 16.[38] Additionally, the Circuit Court of Cook County announced that \"no orders for an eviction or foreclosure will be entered during the 30-day period,\"[39] and the Archdiocese of Chicago announced it would stop holding public Mass from March 14.[40] On March 14, the total number of cases in Illinois rose to 66. These included the first cases in Downstate Illinois, with patients testing positive in Woodford, Cumberland, and St. Clair Counties.[41] A new case in DuPage County was the first Illinoisan resident of a long-term care facility to contract the virus. At O'Hare Airport, travelers returning from Europe faced enhanced screening from U.S. Customs officials due to the federal travel ban put in place the day before. The screenings led to long waits and overcrowded facilities in the airport, which both Governor Pritzker and Mayor Lightfoot harshly criticized as unsafe.[42] On March 15, the number of cases rose to 93. Cases were confirmed in Champaign, Clinton, Sangamon, Whiteside, and Winnebago Counties; meanwhile, Governor Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants closed to sit-in diners.[43] One of the cases in Sangamon County was a woman in critical condition who was hospitalized in Springfield, the state's capital.[44] On March 16, the number of cases rose to 105, and Peoria and Will Counties confirmed their first cases.[1][45] Governor Pritzker announced restrictions for public gatherings, limiting crowds to under 50 people amid growing concerns over the community spread of the virus in the state.[35] On March 17, the number of cases rose to 160. Officials announced the first death related to COVID-19, a woman in her 60s from Chicago; a retired South Side nurse, the woman had an underlying condition later revealed to be asthma, and died at the University of Chicago Medical Center.[46][47] 22 of the new cases were confirmed at a Willowbrook nursing home, including 18 residents and four staff members; these cases were related to an initial case announced on March 14. Northwestern University, University of Illinois at Chicago, and the Illinois Institute of Technology confirmed that individuals on campus had tested positive for the coronavirus.

On November 14, in addition to 11,028 cases, Illinois reported 166 new COVID-related deaths, the most since May 13 and the third most since the pandemic began.[115] However, this number was inflated by a backlog from the previous day. On November 18, Illinois passed 11,000 deaths (11,014) and 600,000 cases (606,771).[116] On November 19, the state recorded 14,612 new cases and 168 deaths, the second and third most since the pandemic began, respectively.[117] On December 2, due to a backlog from the Thanksgiving holiday, Illinois reported 238 COVID-related deaths, the most of any day since the pandemic began.[118] Another 192 deaths were reported the following day, December 3, the second highest count since the pandemic began. This spike pushed the daily average for deaths to its highest point ever, even higher than the first peak in mid-May. Governor Pritzker said that, due to more backlogged reports from the holiday, it is hard to tell how much of the spike can be attributed to the delays.[119] A COVID-19 outbreak started on Veterans' Day on November 11 in the LaSalle Veterans' Home, infecting the majority of residents. By December 21, 34 residents had died of the disease.[120] On June 28, 2021, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) reported 85 cases at a summer youth camp in central Illinois. IDPH was only aware of a few vaccinated individuals, the camp did not check vaccination status, and masks were not required indoors.

B. Pritzker issued a disaster proclamation, the state's equivalent to a state of emergency, as four new cases were announced in the state.[123] Starting on March 9 onwards, Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Public Health have been conducting daily press briefings about the crisis.[124][125] On March 18, Governor Pritzker announced a new website that would be a centralized hub with information an resources related to the coronavirus and the impact on Illinois residents and businesses.[126] During March, the state government announced a series of escalating measures to achieve social distancing.

Some churches defied the governor's order, held meetings and then filed federal lawsuits.[137] Services offered by the state government have also been affected. Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White announced that all driver services facilities throughout the state would be closed from March 17 through March 31.

This also included the Illinois State Museum and its branches which include the Research and Collections Center, Dickson Mounds Museum in Lewistown and the Lockport Gallery in Lockport.[139][140] On March 27, the Illinois Secretary of State, Jesse White announced that notaries public are granted the authority to perform remote, online notarizations during the COVID-19 pandemic via an executive order, Executive Order in Response to COVID-19 (COVID-19 Executive Order No. 12).[141][142] This authority is temporary and is set to expire when the state disaster proclamation is removed. These changes have been accompanied by public policy responses from the state government. On March 25, the Illinois tax filling deadline was extended from April 15 to July 15.[143] This was announced by Governor Pritzker during the daily coronavirus press conference along with a bulletin release from the Illinois Department of Revenue.[144] Gov.

These programs are available through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO).[145] The state government has also coordinated a public health response. The State of Illinois is working with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the private companies of Wal-Mart and Walgreens to provide testing sites in the hardest-hit communities within the state.[54] In a March 22 interview on CNN's State of the Union, Governor Pritzker compared the federal government's procurement of essential medical supplies to the \"Wild West\". \"We're competing against [other states], we're competing against other countries,\" Pritzker said.[146] When asked about protective masks for medical workers, FEMA Director Peter Gaynor could not give any specific answers.[147] On March 31, a CMAS Severe (emergency alert) notification was issued to smartphones in Illinois and neighboring states with the message: \"State needs licensed healthcare workers to sign-up at IllinoisHelps.net to fight COVID-19.\" The message was initiated by Illinois Healthcare Professional Emergency Volunteer Program, a state-run emergency response organization.[148] On March 17, 60 members of the Illinois National Guard were activated to assist during the COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois for the anticipated need of medical staffing and logistic support. Of those 60, 43 are airmen from the Peoria-based 182d Airlift Wing's Medical Group whereas the other 17 are planners and liaison officers from both the Army and Air National Guard.[149] On March 26, roughly 50 additional Illinois National Guard soldiers from the 1844th Transportation Company based in East St. Louis were activated to assist with the COVID-19 response operations.[150] The majority of those activated soldiers will help with medical warehouse operations in central Illinois whereas four soldiers will be assigned to the State Emergency Operations Center in Springfield, \"where their jobs will be to assist with communications, analyze virus response operations and give analysis for possible flood response operations\" as stated in a press release. Governor Pritzker unveiled on May 5 a five-phase plan for reopening the state called \"Restore Illinois\". Each phase has specific thresholds that must be met and allows for each of four zones, based on IDPH's Emergency Medical Service regions, to progress through them individually. The phases are: Phase 1 \u2013 Rapid Spread, Phase 2 \u2013 Flattening, Phase 3 \u2013 Recovery, Phase 4 \u2013 Revitalization, and Phase 5 \u2013 Illinois Restored. Within the same briefing, the Governor announced that Illinois was in Phase 2 of the plan.[151][152] Governor Pritzker announced on May 26, 2020, that the statewide coronavirus test positive rate had averaged 9.2% over the prior seven days, less than half the rate of 23% during the peak in April.[153] Illinois entered Phase 3 on May 29, 2020, with the exception of Chicago which entered Phase 3 on June 3, 2020. The entire state moved into phase 4 on June 26, allowing for larger gatherings of up to 50 people and the re-opening of restaurants and bars, albeit under social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines.[154][155] On August 7, Pritzker modified the state's response including changing the Emergency Medical Services to 11 regions and tightening the metrics for restrictions.[156] On September 21, 2020, Illinois passed the 5 million mark for the number of COVID-19 tests administered, to be the state with the third highest number of tests administered, behind New York and California.[157] In late October, 2020, Governor Pritzker began announcing tightened restrictions to many regions around the state, with 9 of 11 regions seeing the restrictions by October 29,[158] including Chicago. The restrictions include a ban on all indoor dining, limiting social gatherings to 10 people, and limiting organized gatherings to 25% room capacity or 25 people, whichever is lower.[159] Governor Pritzker laid guidelines to postpone high school basketball, but the IHSA voted to continue on schedule.[160] By November 4, all 11 regions were under heightened restrictions.[161] On October 29, Illinois passed 7.5 million total COVID-19 tests.[162] On November 4, 2020, Illinois passed 8 million total tests administered.[163] On November 11, in anticipation of Thanksgiving, the IDPH issued new guidelines. Despite Governor Pritzker's hinting,[164] no formal Stay-at-Home order was issued,[165] the IDPH recommended that, for the next three weeks, all Illinois residents \"stay home as much as possible, leaving only for necessary and essential activities, such as work that must be performed outside the home, COVID-19 testing, visiting the pharmacy, and buying groceries.\"[166] They also recommended that businesses allow employees to work from home and limit all non-essential gatherings.[167] Illinois Regions 5, 7, and 8 restrictions were increased to Tier 2. The regions encompass the southernmost portion of the state as well as Will, Kankakee, Kane and DuPage counties. These new restrictions, in addition to all of the restrictions already in place, include reducing the party size in bars and restaurants to six people, capping all social gatherings at 10 people, with the exception of schools and office & retail spaces, and limiting organized gatherings to 25 people or 25% room capacity, with the exception of fitness centers.[168] On November 17, Governor Pritzker announced that, on November 20, all of Illinois will enter Tier 3 restrictions. In addition to the Tier 2 restrictions, there will be no indoor dining, health and fitness centers are capped at 25% capacity, must require face coverings at all times, and locker rooms have to remain closed, hotels must limit capacity to registered guests. Arcades, casinos, rec centers, theaters, and museums are all required to close.[169] Governor Pritzker said that he hopes that these mitigations will bend the curve and prevent a stay at home order. On November 25, Illinois surpassed 10 million total tests administered, with nearly 700,000 of them being positive.[2][170] On April 11, the McHenry County Department of Health (MCDH) issued a press release pertaining to a court order granting access to the personal health information for patients that had contracted COVID-19 by multiple police agencies.[171][172] These patient records are protected with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 along with State of Illinois' Medical Patient Rights Act. Both acts restrict access to patient records from individuals that unless medically necessary. The MCDH determined that providing access to the addresses of the patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 would suffice both the request by police agencies and both patient privacy acts. However, the rationale by the police agencies \"to protect their officers and deputies by allowing them to avoid contact or don protective equipment\" and the McHenry County court issued a temporary order to release the names. The agencies which requested this information are police departments of City of McHenry, Village of Algonquin, City of Woodstock, and the Village of Lake in the Hills as stated within the court order from the 22nd Judicial Circuit Court in McHenry County.[173] On April 3, Alton Mayor Brant Walker provided his weekly address regarding COVID-19 via a video on the City of Alton's Facebook page. In the video he stated that he had directed the Alton Police Department to use discretion towards those who did not comply with the State of Illinois stay-at-home order.[174] On April 6, Alton Police were investigating a large gathering at Hiram's Tavern located in downtown Alton, which was in violation of the stay-at-home order. Officers issued criminal complaints to all in attendance, including the mayor's wife whom also was in attendance at the establishment. Each complaint is a class A misdemeanor charge that is punishable by up to 364 days in jail and/or a fine of $2,500. The mayor's statement regarding his wife was \"I instructed the Police Chief to treat her as he would any citizen violating the 'Stay At Home' order and to ensure that she received no special treatment\".[175][176] On April 6, Carbondale City Council passed two ordinances with the first declaring a state of emergency and the second to provide guidance on how to enforce the stay-at-home order that was issued by the State of Illinois. The first ordinance allows the city manager the abilities to close any city facility in order to ensure the health and safety of city employees and the community, to enter into temporary agreements with bargaining units to ensure continuation of city services and to adjust personnel policies, designate areas for carry-out and curbside pickup from restaurants in the downtown area of the city, and to extend deadlines for licenses issued under the city code. The ordinance also officially suspends the charging late fees for water and sewer, stopping the disconnection of water and sewer service for non-payment, extension of the payment deadline of the city's food and beverage tax along with the package liquor tax until May 20, extends the motor fuel taxes and hotel/motel taxes until April 30. An additional item that was added was the suspension of the enforcement of the tall grass and weed ordinance. The second ordinance allowed for a streamlined process of the enforcement of the multiple executive orders issued by Governor Pritzker. Typically these orders would be sent through the Jackson County Health Department and then to the Illinois Department of Public Health for review and then off to the county state's attorney for enforcement. Instead these orders will be processed by the City of Carbondale and enforced by the Carbondale Police Department by way of fines up to $750 per day and alleviates a \"minor violation from becoming a misdemeanor or felony charge\".[177] On March 12, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that after meeting with Comcast executives, the company would \"double internet speeds to low income households nationally. Also, 60 free days of internet for low income households\" would be available starting March 16.[178] On March 26, the City of Chicago closed parks, beaches, the 606 trail network, and the lakefront due to too many people gathering, with violators facing fines and possible arrest.[179][180] On April 8, Mayor Lightfoot placed a curfew on all liquor sales after 9:00 pm in the City of Chicago. This curfew went into effect on April 9 and remained in place through the end of the state's stay-at-home order.[181] On May 17, days after the city was sued by a Romanian church that had been ordered not to hold church services even with social distancing, the mayor closed street parking for 9 blocks on Sunday.[182][183] On May 26, the City of Chicago created the Chicago PPE Market, built on Rheaply's Asset Exchange Manager, to connect Chicago's small businesses and nonprofits with city-approved personal protective equipment (PPE) suppliers. In preparation for the reopening of the city, small organizations can use the platform to access necessary protective supplies.[184] On May 26, Mayor Lightfoot announced that the city would spend $56 million from federal and state funds on a contact tracing program, including $11 million marked for a contractor to oversee the program.[185][186] Several progressive activists and elected officials opposed the latter part of the proposal, arguing that the funds should be used to support the Chicago Department of Public Health rather than hiring a contractor.[186] On September 14, Mayor Lightfoot announced the hiring of 500 contract tracers through 31 community organizations.[187] On November 12, in anticipation of typical Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, Mayor Lightfoot announced a \"Stay-at-Home Advisory\" for the city, effective November 16, asking residents to \"shake off COVID fatigue\" and avoid inviting over extended family. She said that, if the measures are ignored, the city would be \"on track to lose 1,000 more Chicagoans by the end of the year or even more.\"[188] The announcement came as the COVID-19 test positivity rate for the city reached 14.1%.[189] On March 30, the Rockford city council passed an ordinance allowing for fines of $750 per day for businesses not adhering to the closure of nonessential businesses during the statewide executive order issued by Governor Pritzker.[190] On March 27, Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder issued an emergency order that restricted public use of the Municipal Center complex. This order prohibits anyone other than city employees conducting public business from assembling, loitering or storing personal property at the municipal complex which included the city's public library, Lincoln Library and Howarth Plaza. Both of these places are popular amongst the city's homeless population.[191] On March 31, Mayor Langfelder issued a second order that halts all evictions and the repossession of vehicles within Springfield and lasts the duration of Governor Pritzker's executive order that was declared on March 20.[192] On April 8, Mayor Langfelder issued another emergency order allowing for the Springfield Police Department to issue tickets and fine individuals who are \"repeat offenders\" who do not adhere to the prohibition of gatherings of more than 10 people and overall lack of compliance with the State's Stay-at-Home order.[193][194] On March 9, Loyola Academy in Wilmette canceled classes due to potential exposure of a student to the virus.[195] In the following days, several universities in Illinois closed or cancelled classes. Northwestern University extended its spring break by one week, after which classes would be held remotely rather than on campus.[33] The University of Illinois and Northern Illinois University took similar measures, adding that residence and dining halls would remain open.[34] Many more Illinois schools, both public and private, announced closures in the following days, including the Archdiocese of Chicago. When Chicago Public Schools did not announce a closure, the Chicago Teachers Union demanded that the district close its schools immediately.[196] On March 13 Governor Pritzker announced that all schools in the state would be closed between March 17 and 30, and later extended to at least April 8.[37][197] On March 19 Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot announced that Chicago Public Schools will remain closed until Tuesday, April 21, 2020.[198] On March 31, Governor Pritzker extended the statewide school closures until April 30.[199] On April 17, Governor Prizker announced that all schools in the state will stay closed for the remainder of the school year.[200] In April 2020, a team was formed to develop and deploy large-scale COVID-19 testing for use on the UIUC campus. The possibilities of using a saliva test were explored; such a test may be a good indicator of how contagious a person is: it tests the fluid which is likely responsible for much of the transmission between people.[201] The team, headed by Paul Hergenrother of the UIUC School of Chemical Sciences,[202] included people in the university's Institute for Genomic Biology, the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, the Department of Microbiology, and the College of Veterinary Medicine where a veterinary diagnostic lab was repurposed for handling the demands of analyzing thousands of samples per day. As this team began its work, reports of methods to detect the virus in swabs, without the time-consuming RNA-extraction step, were appearing,[203] and on April 10, 2020 Rutgers University received FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) for a saliva test (which included RNA extraction).[204] Within two months of the UIUC team's formation, a scientific paper documented the team's research on a rapid saliva test which replaces RNA extraction by heat inactivation, with no need for laboratory personnel to open the vial after an individual provides a saliva sample.[205] Meanwhile, Yale University developed a test which requires that proteinase K enzyme be inserted into the vial before the heat inactivation step.[206] As a CLIA-certified lab, the campus's veterinary diagnostic lab was able to satisfy the Food and Drug Administration's test requirements within the FDA's LDT regulations.[207] By early July, 2020 this lab was running the saliva procedure on samples provided by UIUC employees and students.[208] Starting in mid-March the university developed a smart-phone app to play an important role in the UIUC campus response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[209] The \"Safer Illinois App,\" which had a soft launch on June 8,[210] was built on the ROKWIRE open-source smart-phone platform, established at UIUC in 2018. This was a natural platform to use, since ROKWIRE was already serving the campus with its first product, the \"Illinois App.\" On August 13, 2020, days before students arrived for the fall semester, the Safer Illinois App was announced as operational.[211] Two days later the saliva test lab started analyzing increasing numbers of samples 7 days per week.[212] A mathematical model was used to estimate the number of people who would test positive in entry screening during August 15\u201323.[213] An estimate, made on July 24 using an existing UIUC model of COVID-19 dynamics in Illinois,[214] projected forward to mid-August to estimate of the percentage of infected people within the state of Illinois in mid-August: 0.44%. Based on this, the detection of roughly 200 positive infections was anticipated during entrance screening, with 95% confidence interval of 72 to 414 infections. For students in University Housing, about 5% of the campus room inventory was reserved for isolation or quarantine.[215] A total of 55,034 tests were performed during the August 15 through 23 return to campus, with 288 people testing positive.[212] This number falls within the \"entry screening\" model's 95% confidence interval of 72 to 414 positives. This 0.5% positivity continued during the first week of classes, August 24 through 28. The next four days, August 29 through September 1, saw 588 positive tests, almost equaling the number of positives during the previous 14 days. This was deemed to reflect risky behavior, particularly among undergraduates.[216][217] On September 2 a campus massmail announced a university-wide two-week \"essential activities only\" period and announced increased efforts to identify and remove individuals who were creating risk for the campus and the community.[218] At this time, New York Times writer Kenneth Chang credited the overall UIUC COVID-19 response as \"one of the most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus under control\" and contrasted the UIUC approach to that of most other large state universities \"opening and hoping for the best without doing any kind of serious testing or they've switched to largely online education\" quoting biologist Carl Bergstrom.[219] During the second week of \"essential activities\" there was a sizable decrease in the number of cases observed, and, on September 16 a campus massmail[220] ended the two-week period. Initially the UIUC plan was to test each individual once per week. However, based on modeling studies this was changed to twice per week before large numbers of students arrived on campus in August. This rate was characterized by Nick Anderson of the Washington Post as \"a staggering pace for a large public school\".[221] Soon, this rate of testing strained the laboratory's ability to produce rapid results, which weakened the ability of the testing program to quickly identify people who should go into quarantine.[222] At the same time, it became clear that fewer than 5% of positive tests were from among faculty, staff and graduate students. So, on September 7, 2020, testing of these groups was reduced to once per week.[220] This, combined with an expansion of laboratory capacity, caused laboratory turnaround times to reduce from as high as 48 hours early in the semester to a little over 8 hours by early October.[223] The number of positive tests reached a semester-low of 85 new COVID-19 detections during the week of October 10 through 16, then increased steadily during the following three weeks.[224] On November 10, the university announced that faculty, staff and graduate student positivity was increasing rapidly, so these groups were required to resume twice-per-week testing. Sources: Daily IDPH reports[225][226] From March 16 until May 6, American Airlines, which has a major hub at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, suspended long haul international flights, reducing its international capacity by 75%.[227] Chicago's Navy Pier announced that it will be closed to the public until April 2.[228][229] Navy Pier closed again September 8, 2020 due to low attendance and will remain closed until spring 2021.[230] On March 15, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurant dining rooms to close from March 17 to 30 to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus affecting the state.[6] As of September 25, 62 restaurants in Chicago closed due to the financial impact of COVID-19.[231] United Airlines, whose primary hub is at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, canceled 95% of its international flights in response to the pandemic starting in April.[232] United reported a $2.1 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020, blaming restrictions on the aviation industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[233] In early April, a number of news organizations analyzed data provided by the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office, and the Chicago Department of Public Health showing that African Americans experienced a disproportionately higher death rate due to the virus.[234][235][236] African Americans accounted for 42% of coronavirus-related deaths and 30% of confirmed cases statewide, despite only comprising 14% of the state's population.[234] In Cook County, African Americans accounted for 58% of deaths while comprising 23% of the population.[235] A similar pattern emerged in the city of Chicago, where 72% of deaths and 53% of confirmed cases were African Americans, who make up 30% of the city's population.[237] Likewise, throughout all of 2020, Latinos have had higher rates of testing positive for COVID-19 than other ethnicities, from 20% higher on May 3, 2020, to only 3% higher in June.[238] On April 16, the Cook County government launched a dashboard with regularly updated information on coronavirus-related deaths, disaggregated by race.[239] On April 6, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a plan to address the racially disproportionate impact of COVID-19, proposing surveillance of grocery and corner stores, increase bus service to the city's South and West sides, and a \"racial equity rapid-response team.\"[240][241] On April 9, a group of progressive African American activists and elected officials (including Chicago Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor, Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson, and Illinois House Rep. Sonya Harper) called for a range of policy reforms to address this racial inequality. Their demands included a rent and mortgage holiday, a freeze on utility payments, increases in paid sick leave and hazard pay, an end to cash bonds[clarification needed].[242][241] They also called for a stop to the use of the pandemic as an \"excuse to double-down on racist policing,\" reporting that residents of heavily black neighborhoods in Chicago were being told about a 5pm curfew and being ticketed and detained for being outside.[241] Statistics data tracked through mid-May revealed that black people accounted for 25% of US deaths despite only making up about 13% of the US population; Hispanics made up 24% of deaths while only making up about 18.5% of the population; and white people accounted for 35% despite making up roughly 60% of the population.[243] The AMA Center for Health Equity released a report in October listing structural and social determinants that contributed to the Latino population's higher rates of infection and death.[244] Federal public health officials released a new strategy addressing inequalities, and officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clarified earlier messaging to emphasize that the disproportionately high impact of COVID-19 on minority groups is not due to genetics but rather social conditions that place people of color at higher risk for exposure and serious illness.[243] Reasons cited include working in industries with no sick pay, front line jobs where working from home is impossible, multi-generational and multi-family accommodation, and insufficient space to isolate or quarantine.[243] Combined, academics have referred to these factors as 'structural vulnerability'; Blacks, Latinos, and other marginalized groups are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and may have access to fewer resources to mitigate its effects.[245] Within the Latino community, additional factors are language barriers, fear of deportation, and invisibility in national discourse and rhetoric.[244] Although COVID-19 vaccinations began in December 2020, black and Latino populations are not vaccinated at the same rates as whites, and their neighborhoods continue to have more COVID-19 deaths as of February 2021.[246] According to the Chicago Tribune, blacks and Latinos are getting vaccinated at half the amount as whites. U.S. Rep. Jesús \"Chuy\" García cited factors such as language barriers, healthcare deserts, and fear of deportation. Although the governor said their administration was focusing on improving vaccination access alongside the Illinois National Guard, community leaders such as Rev. Emma Lozano of Pilsen's Lincoln United Methodist Church have remained skeptical.[247] Over March and April, in response to the rise in coronavirus cases, the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) released a number of prisoners early, looking to curb the impact of the pandemic on a vulnerable population.[248] This was accompanied by an executive order by the governor on March 26, suspending further admission to IDOC from county jails.[249] Quarantines were also implemented at these locations, suspending in-person visits.[250] Despite these measures, there were outbreaks of COVID-19 from March onwards, among both prisoners and staff. As of July 9, there have been 203 cases of COVID-19 among prison staff in the state, and 337 cases of COVID-19 among prisoners.[249] Stateville Correctional Center, the largest prison in the state, had the largest number of recorded cases, with 266 cases among prisoners and staff.[249] Most of state's sports teams were affected. Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training on March 12, and on March 16, they announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, affecting the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs.[251] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association suspended the season for 30 days, affecting the Chicago Bulls.[252] Also on that date, the National Hockey League, suspended the season indefinitely, affecting the Chicago Blackhawks.[253] Also on March 12, Major League Soccer suspended the season for 30 days, affecting the Chicago Fire FC.[254] On April 3, the Women's National Basketball Association announced that the beginning of the season originally scheduled for May 15 would be delayed indefinitely, affecting the Chicago Sky.[255] In college sports, the National Collegiate Athletic Association cancelled all winter and spring tournaments on March 12, most notably the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, affecting colleges and universities statewide.[256] On March 16, the National Junior College Athletic Association canceled the remainder of the winter seasons as well as the spring seasons.[257] Also on March 12, the Illinois High School Association announced the cancellation of most remaining winter State Series postseason tournaments, with basketball being the main activity affected.[258] On May 28, 2020, the PGA Tour announced that the John Deere Classic in Silvis would be cancelled for 2020.[259] NASCAR was scheduled to race at Chicagoland Speedway on June 19\u201321, but on May 8, NASCAR announced that the event was cancelled. NHRA cancelled the race at Route 66 Speedway. In Chicago's South Loop district, light-shows became a regular daily event at 8pm every day by mid-April.[260] The Chicago Marathon set to take place on October 11 was canceled due to public health concerns, following the cancelation of the New York City Marathon and Boston Marathon.[261] Many summer events in Chicago were canceled, including: Lollapalooza,[262] Chicago House Music Conference and Festival, Chicago Gospel Music Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, Chicago SummerDance, Taste of Chicago, the Chicago Air and Water Show, Chicago Jazz Festival, and most programming at the Chicago Riverwalk, Chicago Cultural Center and Millennium Park.[263] Midwest Furfest, the world's largest furry convention as of 2022, announced its cancellation of its 2020 event on July 15 of that year.[264] The 2021 event occurred in person with attendees required to show proof of vaccination and wear a face mask, regardless if they are wearing a fursuit or not. In Springfield, Illinois, the Illinois State Fair was canceled for the first time since World War II.[265]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10762","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Illinois"}
