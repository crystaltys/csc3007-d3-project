The song \"Roses on My Grave\" was written in his memory. Before releasing their major-label debut album, Infest, Papa Roach recorded and published an EP in 1994 entitled Potatoes For Christmas. In 1997, their first full-length album, entitled Old Friends from Young Years, was released. Shaddix stopped using rapping as a whole in their 2004 album Getting Away with Murder. In an interview in 2004, Shaddix said that he became disenchanted with hip hop and what it represented in the media and stated that \"I just want to be a rocker\",[5] also stating in 2009 that it was safe to assume he would not be rapping again.[6] However, in 2012, Shaddix started rapping again in the album The Connection.[7] There were some tracks on their 2017 album Crooked Teeth that featured rapping. In 2021, looked back on his and Papa Roach's association with the nu metal genre, reflecting back that \"I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that\u2019s dope, but we\u2019ve been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time.\"[8] On December 13, 2019, Shaddix provided new vocals for a remix of The Hu's \"Wolf Totem\".[9] Shaddix performed as the lead singer of a post-hardcore band called Fight the Sky from 2002 to 2004 under the name 'John Doe'. The band was intended as a side project of Shaddix where he could display the heavier side of his vocals. The band's line-up consisted of Shaddix as the lead singer, Wade Khail as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist, Ali Abrishami as the bass guitarist and backing vocalist, and Jay Ingram on the drums and percussion.
