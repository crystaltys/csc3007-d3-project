{"Content: ":"Numismatics portal A moneyer is a private individual who is officially permitted to mint money. Usually the rights to coin money are bestowed as a concession by a state or government. Moneyers have a long tradition, dating back at least to ancient Greece. They became most prominent in the Roman Republic, and continued into the Empire. In Rome the position of Triumvir Monetalis, held by three people at a time, was a minor magistracy awarded by the Senate, often the first office held by a young politician. Marcus Aurelius is one famous example; John Hull is another with his founding of the Hull Mint for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Moneyers were not limited to the ancient world. When European coinage was revived during the Middle Ages, moneyers again were trusted to create currency on behalf of kings and potentates.[1][2][3][4] For a large part of that era, virtually all coins in circulation were silver pennies, and these often bore the name or other identification of the moneyer.[5]","Title":"Moneyer - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2410","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyer"}
