{"Content: ":"2021 (MMXXI) was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2021st year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 21st year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the 2nd year of the 2020s decade. The United Nations declared 2021 as the International Year of Peace and Trust,[1] the International Year of Creative Economy for Sustainable Development,[2] the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables,[3] and the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour.[4] Like the year 2020, 2021 was also heavily defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the emergence of multiple COVID-19 variants. The major global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, which began at the end of 2020, continued in 2021. Most major events scheduled for 2020 that were postponed due to the pandemic were hosted in 2021, including the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, Expo 2020, and sporting events such as UEFA Euro 2020, the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2021 Copa Am√©rica.[5]","Title":"2021 - Wikipedia","KeyID":"15476","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021"}
