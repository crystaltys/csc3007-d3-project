{"Content: ":"Opposition (21) The Assembly of the Republic (Turkish: Cumhuriyet Meclisi) is the parliament of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It has 50 members, elected for a five-year term by mitigated proportional representation. A party must cross the electoral threshold (5% of the total vote) to be awarded any seats. The parliament is composed of 50 MPs, chosen from six electoral districts, which are coterminous with the districts of Northern Cyprus: Lefkoşa, Gazimağusa, Girne, Güzelyurt, Lefke and İskele. In Northern Cyprus parliamentary elections, voters vote for individual candidates. There are two ways of voting. Parliamentary elections were last held on 23 January 2022. Note: Each voter may cast multiple votes, one for each seat in the parliament. Hence, the vote totals may exceed the number of registered voters. The parliament building is located on Osmanpaşa Caddesi, opposite the Turkish embassy in North Nicosia. The building is a two-storey colonial structure. In 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community was awarded \"observer status\" in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). Since then, the two Turkish Cypriot representatives to PACE are elected by the Assembly of Northern Cyprus.[2] Coordinates: 35°10\u203256\u2033N 33°21\u203230\u2033E﻿ / ﻿35.18222°N 33.35833°E﻿ / 35.18222; 33.35833","Title":"Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14955","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Cyprus"}
