{"Content: ":"Single-day races and Classics Fabio Jakobsen (born 31 August 1996) is a Dutch cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Team.[3] During the 2019 Vuelta a España Jakobsen won two stages, including the final stage of the race on stage 21 in Madrid. A few metres before the finish of the 1st stage in the 2020 Tour de Pologne he heavily crashed after Dylan Groenewegen deviated from his line, forcing Jakobsen into the barriers. The race doctor initially reported that Jakobsen had suffered several major injuries, including serious brain trauma and damage to the upper respiratory tract, a broken palate, and heavy blood loss, and was in life-threatening condition.[4][5] On 7 August 2020, the race organisers announced that Jakobsen was out of the induced coma and in \"good condition\".[6] On 18 August 2020, Jakobsen said that he was \"glad to be alive\" following the crash.[7] Jakobsen returned to professional racing at the Presidential Tour of Turkey on 11 April 2021. Jakobsen raced the 2021 Vuelta a España, where he improved on his 2019 result by winning three stages on this occasion: stages four, eight and sixteen. The early part of the race saw him battle with Jasper Philipsen for the green Points Classification jersey. Philipsen abandoned the race after stage 10 due to illness, which left Magnus Cort and overall GC contender Primož Roglič as Jakobsen's closest points rivals. However, stage 16 proved to be decisive, when Jakobsen won the sprint finish on his 25th birthday.[8] Although he was unable to increase his points total following this stage victory, he remained the overall leader in the points competition until the completion of the race, earning him his first Grand Tour jersey. At the end of the 2021 season, Jakobsen was nominated for Comeback Rider of the Year award on CyclingnewsForum. Jakobsen would win the award in a dominating fashion, gaining the majority of the votes over the other nine riders. In 2022 he won Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne, a stage in Paris-Nice and the Tour of Belgium. He also won the points classification as well as multiple stages in Volta ao Algarve, the Tour of Hungary and Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana.[9] In the 2022 Tour de France, which was his first entry in the Tour, he won the sprint finish on stage 2.[10] On stage 17, which was a major mountain stage with a summit finish in Peyragudes, Jakobsen's entire team returned to the finish line to cheer when they realized he was going to make it inside the time cut. He was the final surviving rider to cross the finish line, and then collapsed up against the barriers with the Broom wagon driving across the line fifteen seconds later.[11] He survived the next day in the high mountains and the rest of the race, making his first Tour de France a successful one.
