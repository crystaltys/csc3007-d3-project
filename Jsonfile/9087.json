{"Content: ":"Adeso (previously Horn Relief) is Nairobi-based humanitarian non-governmental organization.[1][2] Adeso was founded in Connecticut, in 1991 by Fatima Jibrell, initially known as Horn of Africa Relief and Development Organization with a mandate to provide a response to humanitarian needs in Somalia in the context of the Somali civil war and its effects on her homeland of Somalia.[3] In 1998, the organizations changed its name to Horn Relief,[4] it began its Pastoral Youth Leadership Program in the Sanaag region of Somalia, known then as the Buran Rural Institute. The first class had 41 boys and 24 girls.[citation needed] In 2001, the organization held its first Camel Caravan in Somalia, where twenty young people walked for three weeks with nomadic pastoralists to learn about the environment, animal and human health, and peacemaking. In 2002, in response to Fatima Jibrell\u2019s advocacy work, the Puntland Government banned the export of charcoal in the region. Also in 2002, the organization's founder Fatima Jibrell, won the international Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa.[5] In 2003, the organization implemented the first large-scale cash transfer program in Somalia,[6] and its deputy director at the time, Degan Ali, developed the first cash-transfer training curriculum to educate internal staff and partner agencies. In 2006, Fatima Jibrell retired as executive director, and was succeeded by her daughter Degan Ali. The following year, Fatima Jibrell won the National Geographic/Buffet Award for Leadership in African Conservation,[7] and the organization publishes a cash transfer implementation manual.[8] In 2010, the organization started its first country program in Kenya, and in 2011 it opened its first country program outside of the Horn of Africa, in South Sudan. In 2012, the organization changed its name from Horn Relief to Adeso, to reflect its expansion outside of the Horn of Africa, and its emphasis on development rather than simply relief work.[citation needed] In 2014, Somali-American actor Barkhad Abdi joined Adeso as a voluntary Goodwill Ambassador, to help give back to his country of birth through visibility and outreach.[9] In 2019 Adeso pushed for a shift of power towards locally-community run humanitarian organizations.[10] In 2021 Adeso were one of the 286 organizations chosen by MacKenzie Scott to receive a share of her US$2.7billion unrestricted donation.[11] According to Adeso, One of their goals is the education of students to help them build life skills.[citation needed]Training programs however go beyond schools and also include (according to Adeso): Adeso\u2019s responses include emergency cash-based interventions, water trucking, distribution of non-food items, and the rehabilitation of water sources \u2013 often crucial as most emergencies are drought-related. Adeso works to strengthen local economies and protect communities from future shocks. Adeso looks at the skills that are required in new local economies before designing the training programs to equip local people with these skills. Sometimes, this can be as simple \u2013 but as crucial \u2013 as supporting initiatives that teach basic literacy and numeracy skills. Adeso also assists by for example helping farmers bolster their production or helping entrepreneurs establish new jobs. Adeso advocates on behalf of the communities they work with, giving them a voice on a local and international stage, and ensuring their interests and concerns are considered at the highest level. Advocacy efforts cover topics such as illegal overfishing in Somali waters[12] and the importance of allowing cash remittances into Somalia.[13] Adeso has its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, and is recognized as a charity in the UK, Kenya and the United States. According to its 2012 Annual Report, the organization has nine field offices: four in Kenya, three in Somalia, and an additional two in South Sudan. There are approximately 45 staff in the Nairobi office and nearly 250 staff in field offices. The 2012 revenues for Adeso were $25 million.[14]","Title":"Adeso - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9087","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeso"}
