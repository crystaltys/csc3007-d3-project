{"Content: ":"Russia defaulted on part of its foreign currency denominated debt on June 27, 2022, its first such default since 1918.[1][2] The United States Treasury Department in February 2022 moved to cut off Russia from the global economy after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, announcing that it would immobilize Russian central bank assets that are held in the United States and impose sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[3] The $284 billion or more in frozen assets is nearly half of the $585 billion that Russia had stockpiled as of June 2021.[4] The Biden administration initially allowed Russia to continue to repurpose the substantial funds it has kept in U.S. financial institutions to make required payments on its sovereign debt. But on April 4, the Treasury Department banned Russia from withdrawing funds held in US banks to pay off its debt obligations.[5] On 4 April 2022, Russia technically defaulted on its foreign debt by failing to pay its obligations in US dollars (and after the grace period it actually defaulted because it did not pay 30 days grace period interest of around 1.9 million USD). On 8 April, the credit agency S&P Global predicted that Russia will inevitably be in \"selective default on foreign currency obligations\"[6] (NR rating after CC rating[7]) because it tried to pay obligations on dollar denominated debt in rubles, which could not be converted into \"dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts\", since every government can just \"print money\" in the currency it controls (no money is actually printed, i.e. the US can create new virtual money in USD, since the Federal Reserve can purchase federal US Treasury bonds, banks can then draw on the reserve, so more money is \"created\"). A selective default occurs if a borrower defaults on specific (foreign, or more accurately, \"foreign currency\") obligations but not all of its debt.[8][9][10] Two dollar denominated bonds issued by the Russian government matured on 4 April 2022.[8] On 5 April, Russia attempted to pay its bondholders with dollars from $600 million of reserves held in US banks, but these were blocked by the US as part of the sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.[11] The Russian government had a 30-day grace period to meet its contractual obligations, but S&P Global stated that it expects that investors will not be able to convert rubles into \u201cdollars equivalent to the originally due amounts\u201d and sanctions will reduce Russia's \"willingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions\" of the loans.[8] Previously, on 16 March, Russia managed to pay through a new method[12] (acting on a general license issued by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, which was valid until May 25) and thus avoided technical default,[13][14] it also threatened to sue if forced into default[15][16] or use cryptocurrency.[17] Earlier, Russian Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov said that Russia would repay its foreign currency debt only if its foreign currency accounts were unfrozen.[18] On 29 April, Russia's Finance Ministry said that it made an attempt to repay US$649.2 million on Russia-2022 and Russia-2042 Eurobonds (in dollars through non-sanctioned Bank Dom.RF JSC [ru] to Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and then to Citibank N.A., London branch[19]), but it was not clear if the payments would reach the recipients and Russia would avoid default.[20] On 4 May, US and UK regulators cleared the payments[21] with a technical date of 2 May.[22] Five days before the May 25 license expired, Russia again managed to pay on Russia-2026 and Russia-2036 Eurobonds and again avoided falling into the grace period. The next payments after the 27 May one were $235 million across two Eurobonds due on June 23.[23] At the end of May, it turned out that the 30-day grace period still required interest to be paid, which means that the money paid on 29 April (and got into Citibank N.A. on 2 May) was not enough by ~1.9 million $USD and the technical default from 4 April was converted into a real default, as recognized on 1 June by the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee for Europe when 13 members voted, only one of them (Citibank N.A.) voting in favour of Russia.[22] A default for the purposes of CDS contracts \u201coccurs once the determination committee votes for a credit event, which has now happened,\u201d said Gabriele Foa, portfolio manager of the Global Credit Opportunities Fund at Algebris.[24] \u201cOf course\u2026it is a very small amount, so the definition of default is very technical. If, as it seems, it is not possible for foreign investors to receive dollars starting May 25, the default will soon be more material.\u201d On Monday 27 June 2022, Moody's rating agency declared that Russia defaulted on its foreign debt after missing a payment deadline the preceding Sunday.[25]","Title":"2022 Russian debt default - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16386","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_debt_default"}
