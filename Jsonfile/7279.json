{"Content: ":"The Eurovision Song Contest 2018 jurors were a group of 215 individuals, appointed by the participating broadcasters, who voted in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. In all shows, half of the final results were determined by juries.[1] Juries had been used exclusively from the first contest in 1956 to 1996. Beginning in 1997, the contest shifted from using juries to using televoting to award points, and by 2003, televoting was mandatory in all participating countries, unless a failure resulted in the televotes being unusable, in which case a backup jury would be used instead.[2] The juries were reintroduced alongside televoting in 2008, when the points were awarded by televoting but one country from each semi-final would qualify based on the votes of the backup juries. In the 2009 grand final, 50% of the voting was determined by televoting and 50% by juries, a system which has been used in all semi-finals and grand finals since. Due to controversy surrounding the juries in the 2013 contest, the EBU released the names of all jurors in advance of the contest every year between 2014 and 2019, along with their full rankings in all shows, to ensure transparency. This led to some jurors being replaced before the contest. Between 2009 and 2015, the points were awarded by combining the results from each country's jury with the results from the same country's televoting and producing an overall result for the country. However, in 2016, a new voting system was introduced, and the jury results and televoting results were converted into points separately.[3][citation needed] Each country had a five-member jury, of which one member served as chairperson, composed of music industry professionals who were citizens of that country. The juries watched and voted during the second dress rehearsal, held the evening before each broadcast show. Each jury voted in the semi-final that their country was competing in, or, in the case of an automatic finalist, the semi-final their country had been drawn to vote in. All juries voted in the grand final. Each juror ranked all competing songs, with the exception of their own country's song, from their favourite to their least favourite. Each individual ranking in one country's jury was combined to produce an overall ranking for the country. The highest ranked song received 12 points, the second highest ranked song received 10 points, and the third to tenth highest ranked songs received 8 to 1 points.[1][citation needed] The jurors of the 43 participating countries were as follows:[4][5] Some jurors listed on the original list of jurors, published on 30 April 2018, did not go on to vote in the contest.[5]","Title":"List of Eurovision Song Contest 2018 jurors - Wikipedia","KeyID":"7279","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2018_jurors"}
