{"Content: ":"MySejahtera is a mobile application developed by the Government of Malaysia to facilitate contact tracing efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The main goal is quick identification of persons who may have come into close contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. MySejahtera was developed by Entomo (formerly KPISoft), a local developer founded by Anuar Rozhan and Raveenderan Ramamoothie,[1] with strategic cooperation from the National Security Council, the Health Ministry, the Malaysian Administrative Modernisation and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). Launched by then Health Minister Adham Baba on 20 April 2020, the MySejahtera app is available on the Gallery of Malaysian Government Mobile Applications (GAMMA), Apple App Store, Google Play, and the Huawei AppGallery.[2] On 19 November 2020, the Director General Noor Hisham Abdullah confirmed that 9,167 COVID-19 cases had been identified by the MySejahtera app since its launch in April 2020 via contact tracing methods including local district health offices using MySejahtera's database and the tracking of potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients.[3] By 27 August 2021, 1.9 million of the 2.32 million students aged between 12 and 17 years enrolled at Malaysia national schools worldwide had registered for COVID-19 vaccinations via the MySejahtera app.[4] In early November 2021, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin stated that the MySejahtera app would not be used for moral policing in response to Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim's claim that the MySejahtera app was showing Muslims checking into gaming outlets.[5] On 7 November, the MySejahtera app experienced a glitched which causes several users to be issued with incorrect home surveillance order (HSO) and person under surveillance (PUS) statuses. The app's administrators apologised to the public for the panic caused.[6][7] That same day, the United States Embassy in Kuala Lumpur confirmed that Malaysians traveling to the US could show their proof of vaccination on the MySejatera app as well as negative Covid-19 test.[8] On 27 April 2022, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced that scanning the MySejahtera QR code when entering premises is no longer compulsory beginning 1 May 2022.[9] According to data released by the Health Ministry's GitHub portal, MySejahtera app usage plunged 73.8% by 3 May.[10] On 26 May 2022, Khairy Jamaluddin announced that in light of the 2022 monkeypox outbreak, MySejahtera users coming from countries with reported cases of monkeypox would be sent an alert on the MySejahtera app starting 27 May 2022. This was done as to prevent an outbreak of monkeypox in Malaysia.[11] The main function of MySejahtera application is to assist the department in managing and mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak, enable users to monitor their health condition throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, assist users in getting treatment immediately if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 disease and locate nearest health facilities for COVID-19 screening and treatment. It is also widely used in the country for checking in when visiting a new place via the QR code scanning method and is now also used for COVID-19 vaccine registrations.[12][13] MySJ Trace is an extension of MySejahtera that uses Bluetooth Low Energy to scan for other users in proximity and alert the user if they had contact with a COVID-19 patient.[14][15]","Title":"MySejahtera - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9817","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySejahtera"}
