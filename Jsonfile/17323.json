She sings folk-songs from different nations in different languages, romances and compositions written by the members of her group, mostly in rock arrangements.[2][3] Pelageya's mother, Svetlana Gennadiyevna Khanova (Russian: Светлана Геннадьевна Ханова), formerly a jazz-singer, theatre director and performing arts instructor, is now a producer and art director of her daughter's band.[4] Pelageya's father is unknown. Her last name Khanova is the surname of her mother's last husband.[5] At the age of eight, Pelageya entered the musical school attached to Novosibirsk Conservatoire. At nine she was awarded the title \"Best folk-singer of Russia in 1996\" at a television contest.[3] In 1997, she sang at Moscow's 850th Anniversary Pageant concert, was the sole performer at the Heads of Government of Three States Summit (Jacques Chirac, Helmut Kohl, Boris Yeltsin)[6] and participated in KVN TV show as a member of Novosibirsk State University team. In July 1999, she was invited by Mstislav Rostropovich to a musical festival in France alongside Evgeny Kissin, Ravi Shankar, B.B.
