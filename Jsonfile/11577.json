{"Content: ":"See text Peipiaosteidae is an extinct family of fish, known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia. It is considered to be a member of Acipenseriformes, related to sturgeons (Acipenseridae) and paddlefish (Polyodontidae). Fossils have been found in freshwater deposits in China, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. They are generally considered either the earliest diverging group of Acipenseriformes, or the sister group to the clade containing Acipenseridae and Polyodontidae. At least Yanosteus was likely to have been piscivorous, based on a specimen of Lycoptera found in the mouth of one specimen.[1] After.[1]","Title":"Peipiaosteidae - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11577","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peipiaosteidae"}
