{"Content: ":"The State House (formerly Government House) is the official residence and office of the President of Barbados.[1] It was built in 1702 during the colonial days and served as a Quaker Plantation, until it was purchased by the Imperial Government, to act as a replacement to The Bagatelle Great House in the Parish of St. Thomas. From then it served as the residence of the Governor of Barbados. It later continued in the role of official residence and office of the Governor-General of Barbados following political independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. Upon the abolition of the monarchy on 30 November 2021,[2] Government House was renamed \"State House\", and has effectively become the official residence of the President of Barbados.
