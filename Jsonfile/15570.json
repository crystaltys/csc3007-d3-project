{"Content: ":"Luhansk (UK: /luːˈhænsk/, US: /-ˈhɑːnsk/; Ukrainian: Луганськ, pronounced [lʊˈɦɑnʲsʲk] (listen)), also known as Lugansk (UK: /-ˈɡænsk/, US: /-ˈɡɑːnsk/; Russian: Луганск, pronounced [lʊˈɡansk]), is a city in eastern Ukraine which is under the de facto administration of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). As of 2021, the population is estimated to be 399,559 (2021 est.)[1], making Luhansk the most populous city in Luhansk Oblast, and the 12th largest in Ukraine. Until 2014, Luhansk was the capital and administrative center of Luhansk Oblast, but was captured and is currently serving as the capital of the LPR, and the Ukrainian government has since relocated the Oblast's administrative center to Sievierodonetsk, until its capture on the 25th of June 2022. On the 3rd of July 2022, Luhansk region was completely under Russian control. Lugansk was named after the Luhan River, which the city is situated around it. According to folk etymology, the name is also derived to the word \"луг\" (Ukrainian: lug), which means \"meadow\", referring to the floodplains around the river.

The city traces its history to 1795 when the British industrialist Charles Gascoigne founded a metal factory near the Zaporizhian Cossacks settlement Kamianyi Brid. The settlement around the factory was known as Luganskiy Zavod. In 1882 the factory settlement Luganskiy Zavod was merged with the town of Kamianyi Brid into the city of Luhansk (also Luhanske, according to the Kharkiv orthography). Located in the Donets Basin, Luhansk developed into an important industrial center of Eastern Europe, particularly as a home to the major locomotive-building company Luhanskteplovoz. The city was occupied by Nazi Germany between 14 July 1942 and 14 February 1943. On 5 November 1935, the city was renamed Voroshilovgrad (Russian: Ворошиловград, romanized: Voroshilovgrad; Ukrainian: Ворошиловград, romanized: Voroshylovhrad) in honour of Soviet military commander and politician Kliment Voroshilov. On 5 March 1958, after Khrushchev's call to not name cities after living people, the old name was reinstated.[2][3] On 5 January 1970, after the death of Voroshilov on 2 December 1969, the name changed again to Voroshilovgrad. On 4 May 1990, a decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR gave the city back its original name. In 1994 a referendum took place in the Donetsk Oblast and the Luhansk Oblast, with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside Ukrainian, and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level. The referendum was annulled by the Ukrainian government.[4] During the war in Donbas, separatists seized governmental buildings in the region, proclaiming the Luhansk People's Republic. An independence referendum, unconstitutional under Ukrainian law, was held on 11 May 2014. This referendum was not recognized as legitimate by any government except South Ossetia.[5][6] Ukraine does not recognize the referendum, while the EU and US said the referendums were illegal.[7] On 25 June 2014, by the separatist government of the Luhansk People's Republic declared Luhansk the capital.[8] In August 2014, Ukrainian government forces completely surrounded rebel-held Luhansk.[9] Heavy shelling caused civilian casualties in the city.[10][11][12] On 17 August, Ukrainian soldiers entered the rebel-controlled Luhansk and for a time had control over a police station.[13] After the Ilovaisk counteroffensive, LPR forces regained Lutuhyne and other Luhansk suburbs. Ukrainian forces withdrew from the Luhansk International Airport on 1 September 2014, after heavy fighting.[14] Luhansk became the capital and the administrative center of the rebel state of the Luhansk People's Republic. The administration of the Luhansk Oblast was moved to Sievierodonetsk by the government of Ukraine. Some of the more prestigious universities in Ukraine have their home in Luhansk. Luhansk is the location of the main campus of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Luhansk, East Ukrainian Volodymyr Dahl National University and of Luhansk State Medical University. In the Ukrainian Census of 2001,[15] 49.6% of the inhabitants declared themselves as ethnically Ukrainians and 47% as Russians. 85.3% of the population spoke Russian as their native language, while 13.7% spoke Ukrainian, 0.2% Armenian and 0.1% Belarusian. Luhansk is home to Zorya Luhansk which now plays in the Ukrainian Premier League annual football championship and plays at the Avanhard Stadium. The club won the 1972 Soviet Top League. The other football team was Dynamo Luhansk. On 7 September 2006, archaeologists in Ukraine announced that an ancient structure had been discovered near Luhansk, which the press reported as a pyramid antedating those in Egypt by at least 300 years. The stone foundations of the structure were said to resemble Aztec and Mayan pyramids in Mesoamerica. It was later concluded that the site in question was not a pyramid but was still of great interest. During 2014 and 2015, Luhansk has been the scene of intense fighting and most of these buildings are damaged to some extent. Some may be destroyed.
