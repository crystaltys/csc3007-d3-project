{"Content: ":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt III (born July 19, 1938) is an American retired economist and academic[citation needed]. Through his father, he is a grandson of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, and through his mother, he is related to the prominent du Pont family[citation needed]. Roosevelt was the first child born to Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. and his first wife, Ethel du Pont[citation needed]. He was born during his paternal grandfather Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term as president and was his eighth grandchild to be born[citation needed]. After his birth, his father said, \"'Battling' Frank III is a beautiful baby.\"[1] He has a younger brother, Christopher du Pont Roosevelt, born 1941, also from his parents' marriage[citation needed]. From his father's later marriages (who married 5 times in total), he has two younger half-sisters, Nancy Suzanne Roosevelt (born 1952) and Laura Delano Roosevelt (born 1959), and a younger half-brother, John Alexander Roosevelt (born 1977).[2] He also had a younger half-brother, Benjamin S. Warren III (born 1954), from his mother's later marriage to attorney Benjamin S. Warren, Jr.[3] After graduating from St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, Frank Roosevelt received his Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Yale University in 1961, his master's degree from Columbia University in 1968, and his Ph.D. from The New School.[4] His dissertation was entitled Towards a Marxist Critique of the Cambridge School[citation needed]. His work primarily focused on combining Marxism and capitalism in an attempt to make modern economic systems more \"fair\" and less prone to the \"winner takes all\" scenario[citation needed]. In 1977, he became a professor at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, where he was chair of the social sciences faculty from 1988 to 1990 and from 1991 to 1993.[4] In retirement, he continued to speak about his grandparents' legacies.[5][6] He refers to himself as a \"radical\" or \"alternative\" economist.[7] Rhona Free, one of his former students who is a professor of economics at Eastern Connecticut State University, was named in 2004 one of four U.S. Professors of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. In her acceptance speech, she cited Roosevelt as a significant influence, saying, \"The most important teacher I ever had was Frank Roosevelt, an economics professor at Sarah Lawrence. He's much more interested in teaching than in testing and in encouraging than in evaluating. In his classes even an average student, as I was, can learn to think critically, express thoughts carefully, and view the world with an open mind.\"[8] In 2004, the university awarded him the Lipkin Family Prize for Inspirational Teaching.[8] Roosevelt was active in the civil rights movement. During the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Freedom Summer program in Mississippi in 1964, he was arbitrarily arrested by the Mississippi Highway Patrol while driving the civil rights lobbyist Allard K. Lowenstein across the state, but was immediately released when the police realized his identity.[9] Roosevelt, who lives in Manhattan, was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Manhattan Country School from 1970 to 2010.[4] In 1981, he led the effort to put the school's tuition system on a sliding scale.[10] Roosevelt led the effort to build a monument to his grandmother Eleanor Roosevelt at Riverside Park in Manhattan. The Eleanor Roosevelt Monument was unveiled in 1996.[11] Roosevelt has written in support of market socialism.[12] On June 18, 1962, Roosevelt was married to Grace Rumsey Goodyear,[13] at St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church in Darien, Connecticut.[14] At the time of their wedding, Grace was a graduate of Milton Academy and a student at Smith College[citation needed]. She is the daughter of Austin Goodyear (grandson of Charles W. Goodyear) and Louisa (n√©e Robins) Goodyear (granddaughter of Thomas Robins Jr.) who lived at \"White Oak Shade\" in Darien.[15] They have three children, including a set of twins:[2]","Title":"Franklin D.
