{"Content: ":"Gland (French pronunciation: [ɡlɑ̃] (listen)) is a municipality in the district of Nyon in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. The city also is home to the IUCN and WWF headquarters. Gland is known to have been a prehistoric settlement. During the Roman period a farm called Villa Glanis was there. Until the 1960s, Gland was merely a small farming village (essentially vineyards and cattle). Gland is first mentioned around 994 -1049 as de Glans.[3] In 1923 Gland provided the venue for the European Division meeting of the Seventh-day Adventists, where the German Adventist leaders said they regarded whether to serve as combatant in times of war was a matter which should be left to the conscience of individual members of their church.[4] In the 1930s, the Toblerone line, a defensive line, was built along the western edge of Gland, stretching from Lac Léman towards the Jura mountains. Its purpose was to stop a tank invasion from the west. The opening of the highway linking Geneva with Lausanne brought many commuters to this once-quiet place. It is only since the mid-1980s that Gland has started to grow into a town with its own businesses and shopping centers. Gland has an area, as of 2009[update], of 8.3 square kilometers (3.2 sq mi).

All the water in the municipality is flowing water.[5] The municipality was part of the Nyon District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Gland became part of the new district of Nyon.[6] The municipality is located between Lake Geneva and the Côte region. The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Argent, from a hill Vert an Oak-tree of the same fructed Or.[7] The French word 'Gland' means 'acorn'.
