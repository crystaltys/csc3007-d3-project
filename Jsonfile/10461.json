{"Content: ":"The 2020\u201321 Malaysia Government Movement Control Order (Malay: Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan Kerajaan Malaysia), commonly referred to as the MCO or PKP, was a series of national quarantine and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the federal government of Malaysia in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country starting on 18 March 2020.[2] The orders have been commonly referred to in local and international media as \"lockdowns\". MCO measures encompassed restrictions on movement, assembly and international travel, and mandated the closure of business, industry, government and educational institutions to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.[3] The MCO was extended and relaxed to different phases in 2020 and 2021, including the Conditional Movement Control Order (Malay: Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan Bersyarat, shortened to CMCO/PKPB) and Recovery Movement Control Order (Malay: Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan Pemulihan, shortened to RMCO/PKPP). Several phases have been enacted nationwide, but other measures have been localised to individual states and federal territories or smaller areas. The Movement Control Order was included in the National Recovery Plan (Malay: Pelan Pemulihan Negara, shortened to NRP/PPN) launched in June 2021.[4] In October 2021, the Malaysian government lifted movement control restrictions for vaccinated people and announced its intention to treat COVID-19 as an endemic disease.[5] On 16 March 2020, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin made an official speech and officially promulgated the movement control order under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 and the Police Act 1967.[25] The order included the following restrictions: On 18 March, Malaysia began the implementation the movement control order. On 25 March, the prime minister through a live national broadcast announced a first extension of the MCO to last until 14 April.[27][28] There were, however, considerations of a further lockdown until late April or May as the number of cases in Malaysia is expected to peak in mid-April, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).[29][30] On 8 April, Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said that the health ministry was having a discussion with the nation's cabinet regarding the possible extension of the MCO, with the decision of the MCO's duration to be announced no later than Friday.[31][32] On 10 April, the prime minister announced a second extension of the MCO by another fortnight until 28 April, noting that his decision was to give space to the healthcare personnels battling the COVID-19 outbreak, apart from preventing the virus from spreading again and to avoid another increase of cases if the MCO is lifted too early.[33] On the night of 23 April, Muhyiddin announced a third extension of the MCO by two weeks till 12 May, with the possibility of further extensions.[34] The Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) initially warned that violators of the MCO's regulation may be subjected to various penalties under the Penal Code.[35] However, on 18 March, the chamber of the Attorney General released a federal gazette specific to the control order, where violations can be fined up to RM1,000 (US$229) and/or jailed not more than six months or both.[36] On 14 April, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that compounds will no longer be issued by the police from the next day as the penalties were ineffective on reducing MCO violations, and offenders will be arrested and remanded instead.[37] Except for travel to Sarawak, a written police permit with a valid reason was originally planned to be required for interstate travel during the MCO.[38] As a result, large crowds were reported to have gathered at police stations for permits hours before the travel restriction was in effect. Concerned that the crowding will exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, PDRM called off the permit plan a few hours before the MCO, until further notice.[39] During the MCO, PDRM conducted road blocks operations (codenamed \"Ops COVID-19\") along key points across the country,[40] to monitor travellers and warn them to stay home and abide by the order.[41][42][43] From 22 March, Malaysia's military forces were mobilised to augment PDRM's MCO operations; as of April, approximately 7,000 military personnel were deployed to assist.[44][45] From 4 May, in line with the Conditional MCO, PDRM is planning to reduce roadblocks nationwide to focus on social distancing enforcements as well as curbing the entry of illegal immigrants and smuggling activities.[46] On 20 March, RapidKL trains had an extended waiting time of 10 minutes, from the previous duration of 3\u20138 minutes.[47] On 30 March, the national government designated that all businesses such as supermarkets and restaurants, including food delivery services can only be operated from 8AM till 8PM starting from 1 April.[48] Sarawak, however, insisted on its operation time of 7AM till 7PM, citing that Sarawak's daylight is earlier than in West Malaysia.[49] Further measures were instilled starting from 1 April; a person must not be accompanied with other people during travel, a 10 km travel radius for all travellers and the banning of all types of gatherings except for funerals, however the attendees must be kept to a minimum.[50] People who travel for medical purposes are exempted from companion rule and the travel radius.[51] All levels of supply chains regarding agricultural and fishing industries are allowed to be in operation throughout the order.[52] On 10 April, the Malaysian government gave permissions to certain businesses to operate during the order to ensure the sustainability of the country's economy, to prevent the loss of jobs among Malaysians and to ensure continuous access to basic needs and critical products.[53] The Malaysian Government had eased lockdown restrictions on 4 May under a \"conditional MCO,\" which allowed certain business sectors to resume operations. On 10 May Prime Minister Muhyiddin announced in a live broadcast, that the CMCO will be extended until 9 June, the fourth extension since 18 March. Muhyiddin Yassin clarified that all rules and standard operating procedures (SOPs) introduced during the conditional MCO would remain in force until 9 June and that any changes to the SOPs or the list of sectors allowed to operate will be announced. There will be a ban on interstate movement during the Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the Kaamatan Feast and Hari Gawai holiday periods.[54][55] From 27 March 2020, specific locations were subjected to a stay-at-home order, known as the \"Enhanced Movement Control Order\" (EMCO or Enhanced MCO), for 14 days if a large cluster was detected within the area for the government to conduct a thorough COVID-19 test towards all residents, and to curb the spread of the virus out of the areas. The orders included:[56] On 27 March, two areas in Simpang Renggam, Johor were subjected to the order till 9 April as those areas alone contributed to a high 61 positive cases.[56] On 30 March, this order is applied to a few hamlets in Sungai Lui, Hulu Langat District, Selangor due to a detection of a cluster involving a madrasa with 71 positive cases.[57] City One, a residential complex in Jalan Munshi Abdullah, Kuala Lumpur which its residents are mainly foreign workers was subjected to the extended order on 31 March as 17 cases involving residents of the tower were detected.[58] Selangor Mansion and Malayan Mansion, apartment buildings located at Jalan Masjid India, Kuala Lumpur, were subjected to EMCOs on 7 April, as 15 positive cases were detected within the two buildings,[59] while Jalan Masjid India and its surrounding areas were subjected to EMCOs on 14 April.[60] Similarly, an EMCO order was placed for over 15,000 residents living around the Kuala Lumpur Wholesale Market in Selayang on 20 April until 3 May, following the detection of 20 cases and one fatality from the area.[61] On 6 April, Malaysia's Defence Minister, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, suggested that the government is planning for a new standard operating procedure regarding the EMCO and the government tried to not impose an excessively wide radius towards areas subjected to the EMCO.[62] On 9 November, the Government extended the Enhanced Movement Control Order over several areas in Sabah, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Sarawak in response to a spike in cases nationwide.[63] From 14 May 2020, Pudu area in Kuala Lumpur comes under semi enhanced movement control order (SEMCO). Soldiers and police put up barbed wire fences at road exits. It is understood that besides Jalan Pudu, the affected roads are Jalan Kancil, Jalan Pasar, Jalan Landak, Lorong Brunei 2 and Lorong Brunei 3. Several busy commercial districts in the Klang Valley have been put under various lockdowns, including the enhanced movement control order (EMCO). As the number of daily cases and active cases of COVID-19 reduced in Malaysia by mid-April 2020, the government had relaxed several measures of the MCO. Transport Minister Dr Wee Ka Siong confirmed that all public transportation services would resume on 4 May but would abide by social distancing measures.[64] On 30 April, the Government announced that two family members will be allowed to buy food and other daily essentials as part of the relaxation of MCO restrictions.[65] On 21 June, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that couples whose marriage registration had been delayed as a result of the Movement Control Order could not complete the process at all permitted NGOs in the country including clan organisations, temples, churches, and religious bodies.[66] Muhyiddin Yassin in his Labour Day speech on 1 May 2020 announced a plan named the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO or Conditional MCO), a relaxation of regulations regarding the MCO, with its main goal was to reopen the national economy in a controlled manner.[67] The CMCO was scheduled to start from 4 May.[67] The regulations of the CMCO as stated in his speech included:[68] However, the CMCO received mixed reactions among state governments around Malaysia.[69] The states of Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Sabah and Sarawak decided to not implement the CMCO by 4 May, either to give way to discussions regarding the implications of reopening economic sections towards the future trend of Malaysia's pandemic or to secure the positive development of the pandemic.[70] The governments of Selangor and Perak restricted some business sectors operating during the CMCO while Negeri Sembilan only allowed economic sectors to reopen.[69][70] The government of Penang on the other hand had implemented a three-phase gradual reopening till 13 May.[69] The CMCO received backlash by politicians, health experts and the general public over concerns of a possible resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia due to the seemingly reckless and unnecessary relaxation of the MCO; the federal government responded by stating that the CMCO is stricter than relaxation measures taken in other countries.[71][72] By 3 May, over 420,000 members of the public had signed a petition of objection to the conditional MCO and urging the government to stay with the MCO.[73] On 7 November, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Malaysian Government would be reinstating the CMCO throughout most of Peninsular Malaysia except Kelantan, Perlis, and Pahang between 9 November and 6 December 2020. Besides, CMCO measures for Sabah, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya, which were scheduled to end on 9 November, were extended until 6 December. Under these new CMCO measures, all educational institutions, social and cultural activities will be required to cease but economic activities can continue under set standard operating procedures.[74] On 13 November, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Malaysian Government would allow three people from the same household per car, easing an earlier CMCO restriction limiting cars to just two people following a public backlash.[75] On 20 November, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob approved a domestic travel bubble programme within green zones. He also announced the elimination of CMCO restrictions within in the states of Johor, Kedah, Malacca, and Terengganu with the exception of certain districts.[76] On 5 December, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob confirmed that the Conditional Movement Control Order would end for most states except Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, most of Selangor, and parts of Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Kelantan and Perak; where the CMCO would be extended until 20 December.[77] On 7 December, the National Security Council lifted the cap on the number of diners allowed to share tables at restaurants in areas under the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) including Kuala Lumpur.[78] On 18 December, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob extended the CMCO in Kuala Lumpur and much of Selangor with the exception of Sabak Bernam, Hulu Selangor, and Kuala Selangor from 21 December to 31 December 2020.[79] In addition, the CMCO was extended in Sabah and several districts in Negri Sembilan, Johor, Penang, and Perak until 31 December. Meanwhile, the CMCO in certain districts of Kedah and Kelantan will revert to Recovery Movement Control Order on 20 December.[80] On 28 December, the National Security Council extended the CMCO in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor from 1 January until 14 January in response to a surge in cases and clusters in those areas.[81] On 7 June 2020, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the Conditional Movement Control Order would end on 9 June, with the country entering into the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) phase between 10 June and 31 August.[82] The Prime Minister also announced that interstate travel would be allowed from 10 June under the RMCO except in areas remaining under the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO).[83] In most areas, certain religious activities at mosques are allowed again, but with many restrictions. In Selangor, for example, Muslims are only allowed to go to certain mosques for Friday prayers after receiving an invitation from the mosque authorities, or after having their application accepted by the religious authorities. The number of attendees is also restricted to 40, and then later to 150 people only,[84] as they are instructed to bring their own prayer mats and only sit within their own prepared spaces, distanced a metre away from each other. In Kuala Lumpur, several mosques operated on a 'first-come, first-served' policy.[85] On 26 June, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that sectors under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture such as meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions, travel and trade fairs, as well as a spa, wellness and reflexology centres would be allowed to open from 1 July. However, tourism businesses are required to abide by social distancing measures, limit crowds to 200\u2013250 people, check customers' temperatures, wear face masks, and provide hand sanitizer. While reflexology centres provided by the blind are allowed to reopen, only Malaysians can work in spas, wellness, and reflexology centres. Ismail Sabri also announced that tuition centres, special education schools and private schools would be allowed to operate soon.[86] On 29 June, it was reported that both government and private pre-schools, kindergartens, nurseries and daycare centres would resume operations from 1 July. Under the RMCO, a range of businesses and activities have been allowed to resume operations including spas, wellness and foot massage centres, cinemas, meetings, seminars, weddings, birthdays, and religious gatherings. Besides, swimming in public, hotel, condominium, gated community and private pools have also been allowed.[87] On 3 July, Religious Affairs Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Dr Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri clarified that foreigners would not be allowed to attend congregational prayers at mosques and surau until the department had studied reports from the Federal Territories Islamic Religious Department regarding the situation. Zulkifli expressed hope that the situation would be resolved within a month or two.[88] On 10 July, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that family entertainment centres including game arcades, karaoke centres, indoor funfairs, edutainment centres for children, and kids' gymnasiums could resume operations from 15 July.[89] On 28 August, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced the extension of the RMCO by a further 4 months until 31 December 2020.[90][91][92] On 1 January 2021, Senior Minister Dato Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the RMCO has been extended to 31 March 2021 as cases are still high.[93] On 5 December 2020, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Government would allow unrestricted interstate travel across states and districts from 7 December with the exception of areas under an Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO), which will still require a police permit.[77] On 11 January 2021, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that Movement Control Order restrictions would be re-introduced to the states of Malacca, Johor, Penang, Selangor, Sabah and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan between 13 until 26 January 2021. It was dubbed as MCO 2.0 widely. These restrictions include: On 15 January, Prime Minister Muhyiddin announced that MCO restrictions would be reimposed on Kelantan and Sibu, Sarawak between 16 and 29 January in response to a surge of cases.[95] On 21 January, several betting outlets in peninsular Malaysia and Sabah announced they were closing until 4 February to comply with the Government's new Movement Control Order.[96] On 21 January, Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Government would be allowing restaurants, food stalls and food deliveries in states under the MCO to operate until 10pm starting 22 January, easing a week-long rule of only allowing operations to run until 8pm.[97] On 21 January, the Malaysian Government extended the country's MCO restrictions in Selangor, Penang, Johor, Malacca, Sabah and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan until 4 February due to a continuation of rising cases and deaths.[98] On 2 February, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob extended MCO restrictions over all states except Sarawak from 5 to 18 February 2021.[99] On 4 February, Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that three business activities night markets, hair salons, and car wash services would be allowed to operate under a strict operating procedure from 5 February onwards as Phase One together with some businesses.[100] On 9 February, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob confirmed that dining in and retail shops are allowed to open, subject to rule of 5 per table; which is being implemented from 10 February 2021, moving from Phase One to Phase Two. However, the Phase Two will only exist until July 2021.[101] On 11 February, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob confirmed that gym activities, golf, table tennis, badminton and tennis would be allowed from 12 February with social distancing and time restrictions.[102] On 13 February, the National Unity Ministry confirmed that non-Muslim places of worship would be allowed to start reopening from 12 February for the remainder of the Movement Control Order, which is scheduled to end on 18 February 2021.[103] On 16 February, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the government would extend the MCO for Selangor, Johor, Penang and Kuala Lumpur until 4 March 2021. Meanwhile, Kedah, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Terengganu, Kelantan, Melaka, Pahang and Sabah as well as the federal territories of Putrajaya and Labuan transitioned back into the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) from 19 February 2021.[104] On 25 February, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibitions (MICE) sector in states under the Movement Control Order would be allowed to resume from 5 March 2021.[105] On 5 March 2021, Selangor, Johor, Penang and Kuala Lumpur exited the Movement Control Order lockdown and entered the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO). This coincided with the launch of Malaysia National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme, which commenced the previous week.[106] On 12 March, Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas confirmed that the CMCO in Sarawak would be extended by a further two weeks from 16 March to 29 March.[107] The CMCO in Sarawak was extended for two more weeks from 13 April until 26 April 2021.[108] The Sarawak Disaster Management Committee subsequently extended the CMCO until 10 May and then 17 May.[109] The Conditional MCO (CMCO) has been extended to 28 April 2021 in Johor, Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Penang. The Recovery MCO (RMCO) has been extended in Sabah, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan (except Seremban district under CMCO), Kedah (except Kuala Muda district under CMCO), Pelis, Perak, Terengganu, W.P Putrajaya and W.P Labuan from 13 to 28 April 2021.[110] Movement Control Order restrictions were reimposed in Kelantan from 16 April until 29 April 2021, before being extended until 17 May 2021.[111][112] From 3 May 2021, the Malaysian Government reimposed a two-week Movement Control Order in Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sarawak, and Selangor in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases. Schools were closed and social and religious activities were banned. While some economic activities were allowed, eateries can only provide takeaway services.[113] From 6 May until 17 May 2021, the Malaysian Government re-imposed a two-week Movement Control Order in Selangor (except Sabak Bernam, Hulu Selangor, Kuala Selangor), in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases.[114] MCO restrictions were also reimposed on Kuala Lumpur, Johor (Johor Bahru, Kulai, Kota Tinggi), Terengganu (Besut), and Perak (Larut Matang & Selama, Mukim Taiping) between 7 and 20 May 2021.[114][115] The government has also imposed a nationwide ban on inter-district travel from 10 May until 6 June 2021.[116] On 8 May, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob confirmed that the Malaysian Government would not implement a nationwide movement control order but will instead use targeted movement restrictions in response to local outbreaks.[117] That same day, Ismail also confirmed that all interstate and inter-district travel without police approval would be banned nationwide from 10 May to 6 June 2021.[118] On 10 May, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that a nationwide Movement Control Order lockdown would be reinstated from 12 May to 7 June. Dining in, social activities and shopping areas will be banned, although workers are allowed to go to work and come back home. Inter-district and inter-state travel are banned.[119] A stricter form of the Movement Control Order lockdown was suggested by the government on 22 May. It was imposed on 25 May and lasts for two weeks. Under the updated form of the Movement Control Order, shoppers are only allowed to visit shopping malls and restaurants for only two hours.[120] Shopping malls and eateries can only operate until 8pm, and all sea and land transport services can only operate up to 50% of their capacity.[121][122] In May 2021, RapidKL trains' frequency times were extended to 10 minutes during peak hours, and 30 minutes during normal hours.[123] Sabah used a slightly different form of the Movement Control Order from 25 May onwards. Under its modified MCO, food and beverage outlets, grocery shops, self-service laundromats, and other businesses can only operate until 9pm; all restaurants can only operate until 10pm; customers visiting shopping malls, restaurants, grocery stores, hypermarkets, and mini-markets may be inside the premises for one hour; and said premises can only operate up to 50% of their capacity, with at least 200 square feet per customer.[124] That ended with the nationwide lockdown on 1 June. On 28 May 2021, Prime Minister Muhyiddin announced that a nationwide \"total lockdown\" or Full Movement Control Order (FMCO) will be imposed on all social and economic sectors in Malaysia from 1 June to 14 June 2021. Under this lockdown, only essential economic and social services listed by the National Security Council will be allowed to operation. This will be followed by a second phase lasting four weeks from 14 June under which more sectors will be allowed to reopen, provided these activities do not involve large gatherings. The new master plan for exiting the lockdown will be announced in July 2021.[125][126] On 12 June 2021, the Malaysian Government extended the country's total lockdown (FMCO) by another two weeks until 28 June since daily new cases are still averaging over 5,000.[127] On 27 June 2021, the Malaysian government announced that country-wide lockdowns will be extended indefinitely until daily cases fall below 4,000.[128] Restaurants are also allowed to operate from 6am until 10pm from 28 June onwards.[129] Due to the lockdown, more and more lower-income households are running out of food and income. Several activists organised the #benderaputih movement, calling the affected households to raise white flags or pieces of cloth to alert their neighbours and receive aid.[130] At the same time, people raised red flags to ask for aid for their pets, and black flags to protest the government's poor handling of the pandemic.[131][132] As Perlis, Perak, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang have met the conditions needed, the government has allowed these states to move to Phase 2 of the lockdown on 5 July. This allows more businesses to be opened up, such as stationary and book shops, computer and telecommunication outlets, barberstores (only for haircuts), farmers' markets, and morning markets.[133][134] On 7 July, Pulau Pinang entered into Phase 2 of the lockdown.[10] On 24 July, Prime Minister Muhyiddin announced that the construction sector was allowed to operate under strict compliance to the SOP, along with the construction of roads and other public infrastructures. He also stated that all workers in the construction sector must be vaccinated.[135] On 15 June 2021, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin introduced a four-phase National Recovery Plan (NRP) to help the country emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout.[6][136] As each phase is based on the amount of new cases, people requiring ICU treatment, and vaccination rates (by having two shots), it can be extended, or moved on to the next phase, whenever possible. From 7 August onwards, the number of new Covid cases with serious symptoms were used to indicate whether a state was ready to move up to Phases 2 and 3. Asymptomatic cases were no longer counted, as over 40 percent of the adult population had been vaccinated by the time the policy was changed.[137] From 10 August onwards, fully-vaccinated people in Phase 2 and 3 states had more freedoms: they were required to wait for 14 days after their second dose (or 28 days for single-dose vaccines). Fully-vaccinated people were also able to be quarantined at home after returning, instead of being sent to a quarantine centre, provided they showed that they had no signs of infection within three days, and they presented their vaccination certificates[138] From 20 August onwards, fully-vaccinated people were no longer affected by the 10-kilometre limit when travelling.[139] As around 66% of the country's population were vaccinated, and to make them more easier for the people to understand and follow, the government reduced the number of SOPs from 181 to just 10 in two weeks from 14 September 2021.[140] On 23 September 2021, petrol stations, restaurants, eateries, and convenience stores were allowed to operate from 6am to 12 midnight, to aid the economic recovery of the country. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob also announced that when 90% of Malaysia's population had been fully-vaccinated, interstate travel will be allowed again.[141][142] On 24 September 2021, the government planned to permit interstate travel within three weeks in early October, which would be when 90% of the adult population will have been fully-vaccinated.[143] Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin also announced that foreign tourists will be allowed against when the country enters the endemic phase of the Covid outbreak.[144] On 27 September 2021, husbands were allowed to accompany mothers who were in labour, if they were fully-vaccinated.[145] Muhyiddin Yassin, who headed the National Recovery Council, also announced that State Recovery Councils were set up in each state in Malaysia.[146] From 4 October 2021, immediate family members were also allowed to accompany mothers or relatives who were giving birth.[147] From 1 October 2021, Genting Highlands, Melaka, and Tioman Island will have their own travel bubbles and get reopened for tourists.[148] States under Phases 2 and 3 were also permitted to hold state and private functions, such as opening ceremonies and workshops, on the condition that all the guests were vaccinated and the number of people present were less than 50% of the venue's capacity. People who were not vaccinated were required to do saliva tests, or self-tests before the host or medical practitioners to check if they had the virus or not. Sports spectators and supporters were allowed to attend sports games or recreational venues, but they were not allowed to eat or drink.[8] On 15 October 2021, higher learning institutions were allowed to reopen.[8][149] On 31 October, schools in Kedah and Kelantan were allowed to reopen; and on 1 November 2021, schools in Perak, Pulau Pinang, and Sabah were allowed to reopen.[150] Theme parks across the country are planned to be reopened on November, when 90% of Malaysia's adult population will be fully-vaccinated.[151] Industries Unite (a coalition of 110 local trade groups) has criticised the National Recovery Plan as being unclear.[152] The conditions are the same as \"total lockdown\" launched from 1 June 2021. The phase ended on October 1 as Kedah, the last state to remain under the phase, moved to Phase 2. Fully vaccinated people were allowed to attend prayers at mosques, temples, churches, and other houses of worship. Mosques in red zones were only able to take in 50 people, while mosques in orange, yellow, or green zones were able to take in 100 people.[155] On 19 August 2021, Muhyiddin had announced that dine-ins were allowed again in Phase 1 states and Kuala Lumpur, but only for fully-vaccinated individuals. The revised rule took effect on 20 August. Children under the age of 17 may follow their parents, but were required to follow SOPs. The government also allowed daily and night markets, camping, picnics, and various outdoor individual sports and recreational activities such as jogging, taichi, exercise, cycling, fishing, equestrian riding, skateboarding, archery, hiking, singles tennis and badminton, and golf.[156] On 21 August 2021, the 10 km travel radius limit was dropped in Phase One states for fully-vaccinated people, although interstate and interdistrict restrictions remained.[157] On 9 September 2021, cinemas were permitted to be reopened for fully-vaccinated people, but only at 50% capacity. Other activities related to the creative industry were allowed, including indoor busking, theatrical and lounge performances, art galleries, museums, and showrooms. All of them except for indoor busking were subjected to a 30% capacity rule.[158] On 10 September 2021, RapidKL reduced its waiting times for trains and buses to support the growing number of workers going back to their reopened workplaces. On peak hours, trains arrived at around 4 to 10 minutes, on non-peak hours, trains arrived from 7 to 12 minutes, and on weekends they arrived on 7 minutes (central business district for LRT Ampang/Sri Petaling) or 15 minutes.[159][160] On 1 October 2021, Kedah and Johor became the last states to leave Phase 1.[8] The majority of the states are currently in this phase. Under this phase: Due to improving conditions, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Perak are the first states to enter into Phase 2 on 5 July.[9] On 7 July, Pulau Pinang moved to Phase 2.[10] On 10 July, Sabah moved to Phase 2. It also allowed dining-in at restaurants on the same day.[11] On 14 July, Sarawak moved to Phase 2.[12] It allowed dining-in at restaurants on 15 July.[163] On 20 July, two more changes to Phase 2 SOPs were announced due to the increasing vaccination rate. Business premises and petrol stations were allowed to operate from 6am to 10pm.[164] Only earlier film projects about drama, advertisements, and documentaries that were postponed due to MCO were allowed to resume, and they would only film outside the studio and away from residential areas with health screenings before, during, and after the filming.[165] On 20 August 2021, the state government of Sarawak banned dining-in at restaurants, restricted businesses to operate from 5am to 8pm, and prohibited anyone from leaving their homes after 10pm except for emergencies.

Under Section 5 of the Prevention and Control of Infectious\u202fDiseases Act 1988, the Health Ministry is the main authority in charge.[255] However, on 6 April 2020, Minister of Defence Ismail Sabri Yaakob reported that only the National Security Council (NSC) can issue directives during the MCO.[256] Dr Yusramizza further noted that unless \"disaster emergency\" or \"a security area\" is declared by the Prime Minister based on Section 18 of the National Security Council Act 2016 and Article 25 of the Malaysia National Security Council Directive 20, the military is not empowered to arrest, seize and search.[255] Kuala Lumpur lawyers Haeme Hashim and CK Lew from Messrs. Haeme Lew suggested that the government ought to declare a \"disaster emergency\" according to Article 25 of the Malaysia National Security Council Directive 20 and for the entirety of Malaysia to be declared as a \"security area\" under Section 18 of the National Security Council Act 2016, failing which the NSC and military do not have full power in administering this Movement Control Order. Only the police have full power and the military only works to assist the police in strengthening control over the order.[257] Civil society organisation Malaysians Against Death Penalty and Torture (Madpet) has stated that a special task force may be formed to assist health ministry, but not the NSC. A spokesperson for Madpet Charles Hector noted that the Malaysian government may have quietly and wrongly resorted to using the draconian National Security Council Act 2016 in the combat to curb and defeat the coronavirus threat as the NSC, under the NSC Act, seemed to be making decisions and issuing orders on coronavirus-related issues. Hector notes that the Ministry of Health's authority may be ousted by the NSC, and that the NSC may be wrongly taking overpower and control from the Ministry of Health, which is really the responsible Ministry under the Prevention And Control Of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.[258]","Title":"Malaysian movement control order - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10461","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_movement_control_order"}
