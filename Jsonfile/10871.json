The following table includes the data reported daily by the Ministry of Health, based on the information available at 21:00 the day before the report is released.[1] On 9 June 2020, the Ministry of Health announced a new process to count the number of fatalities, based on the data recorded by the Civil Registry and Identification Service the day before.
