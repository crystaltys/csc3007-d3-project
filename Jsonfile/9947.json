{"Content: ":"MaltaToday is a twice-weekly English language newspaper published in Malta. Its first edition was published in 1999, and started out as a Friday newspaper.[1] MaltaToday was first published on Friday, 19 November 1999. It was edited by Saviour Balzan, and intended to provide an alternative to the English-language press in circulation, such as the Times of Malta and the Malta Independent.[1] Initially published weekly on Fridays, the paper was then published on Sundays from 2001, with an additional Wednesday midweek paper being reintroduced in 2007.[2] The style of paper is liberal and pro-European, and is independent of political parties. The sister Maltese-language paper Illum was first published in 2006.[3] In 2010, MaltaToday launched its internet news portal, and is the second most popular local news portal.[4] The current editorial lineup includes Matthew Vella as Executive Editor, with Saviour Balzan as Managing Editor. The online editor is Kurt Sansone.","Title":"Malta Today - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9947","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta_Today"}
