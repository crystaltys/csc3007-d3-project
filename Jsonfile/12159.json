{"Content: ":"Large aquaria exhibit a large number of species and animals in a large range of tanks. These tend to be public aquaria and may also be oceanaria and dolphinaria, in order to exhibit a wide range of different marine animals for the public. Some have even come to attain world records for their capacities. Only aquaria with a total capacity of more than 10 million litres and/or a tank larger than 5 million litres are included in the list. The list is not necessarily complete; aquaria that may meet the criteria but do not have published sources on their capacity may not be reflected in the list.","Title":"List of largest aquaria - Wikipedia","KeyID":"12159","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_aquaria"}
