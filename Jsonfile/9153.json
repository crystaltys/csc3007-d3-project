{"Content: ":"The Belgian Red Cross is a humanitarian organization that aids in providing emergency and disaster related services and relief as well as providing education for disaster awareness within the population of Belgium. It is a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The mission of the Belgian Red Cross follows the same guidelines and principles of all International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement organizations: to prevent medical, psychological, and sociological problems and crisis. The Belgian Red Cross aims to aid in resolving such problems and issues through the implementation of trainings, educational development, and through the overall assistance and presence of Red Cross members in times of turmoil. The members of this organization believe in the strength of social bonds amongst individuals as being the greatest preventative measure against isolation and marginalization. [1] The Red Cross and The Red Crescent are both humanitarian organizations that are dedicated to providing relief and assistance for prisoners of war, inspecting the conditions of prisons and helping in times of natural disasters. There is little difference between the Red Cross and the Red Crescent other than their symbol. The cross is a symbol best known in Christianity, and those that are Muslim do not particularly want to be represented with a Christian symbol; hence the crescent. The crescent is an Islamic symbol important to the Muslims, similarly as the cross is to those of the Christian belief. Therefore, the Red Crescent and the Red Cross both provide primarily the same humanitarian services and aid as one another.[2][3] The Belgian Red Cross was established on February 4, 1864, by Doctor Andrea Wegner. Its headquarters is in Brussels, Belgium.[4] This is a Flemish independent volunteer based organization under the umbrella of The Belgian Red Cross and is a connected member of the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement. The mission of this umbrella organization is best divided into three parts. The assistance from volunteers is what heavily drives this organization, and is the foundation on which it practices. [5] This is a French speaking Belgian branch of the Red Cross. This subsidiary organization of the Belgian Red Cross is also like Rode Kruis-Vlaanderens as it is a connected member of the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement. The mission of this Belgian Red Cross branch are as follows:[6] At the Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, Belgium the world can reflect and remember the First World War, and the role that the Red Cross played during this wartime. It was created by the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) Delegation to the EU (European Union), NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the Kingdom of Belgium and the Belgian Red Cross. The exhibit features the work both back during the war as well as currently; which allows the common eye to see the semblance that much of it has. In this exhibit visitors can look up if any of their ancestors or relatives were registered as a Prisoner of War during '14-18'. This exhibit was open to the public eye for viewing until the end of December 2014.[7] On March 22, 2016, the Belgian Red Cross sent approximately 400 people to respond to the bombings in Brussels. They sent 30 ambulances to the Zaventem Airport and Maelbeek metro station. They transported over 100 wounded individuals to over 16 different hospitals to gain medical care.[8] One of the mission projects of the various umbrella organizations of the Belgian Red Cross is providing assistance in helping individuals reunite and find their family members. The Belgian Red Cross aids in providing resources for people to find their family members that may be lost or missing as a result of some of the following factors: violent situations and armed conflict, man-made or natural disasters, migration, war (e.g., World War II), or any other situations of humanitarian need.[9] Afghanistan Albania Algeria Andorra Angola Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Australia Austria Azerbaijan The Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Brazil Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Central African Republic Chad Chile [es] China Colombia Comoros Congo [it] Congo, Democratic Republic of the Cook Islands Costa Rica [es] Côte d'Ivoire Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark [da] Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador [es] Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Eswatini Ethiopia Fiji Finland France Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Greece Grenada Guatemala Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Honduras Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Korea, North Korea, South Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Mauritania Mauritius Mexico Micronesia, Federated States of Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nepal Netherlands New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria North Macedonia Norway Pakistan Palau Palestine Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Poland Portugal [pt] Qatar Romania Russia Rwanda Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino São Tomé and Príncipe Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Sudan Spain [es] Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Sweden Switzerland Syria Taiwan (Republic of China) Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand Timor-Leste Togo Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Tuvalu Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Venezuela Viet Nam Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe Hong Kong (autonomous branch of the Red Cross Society of China) Macau (autonomous branch of the Red Cross Society of China) Northern Cyprus (non-member) Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (pending recognition and admission) Taiwan (former member)","Title":"Belgian Red Cross - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9153","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Red_Cross"}
