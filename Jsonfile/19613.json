{"Content: ":"Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster, 2nd Lord of Connaught (English: /dˈbɜːr/; d\u2019-BER; c. 1230 \u2013 28 July 1271) also spelt Burke or Bourke, was an Irish peer from the House of Burgh. De Burgh was the second son of Richard Mór de Burgh, 1st Lord of Connaught and Egidia de Lacy. He founded Athassel Priory. In 1243, he succeeded his father as Lord of Connacht. In a royal order from Westminster in September 1247, Sir John Fitzgeoffrey was charged by the king with seizing the lands of Walter de Burgh's older brother Richard, who had died. The de Burgh lands in Connaught were being held by John de Livet, likely the son of Gilbert de Lyvet, one of the earliest Lord Mayors of Dublin and Marmaduke de Eschales (Scales). In 1264, he married a cousin, Lady Maud de Lacy, only daughter and heiress of Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster (by his second wife, Emmeline de Riddlesford, the granddaughter of Walter de Riddlesford). That year De Burgh was created Earl of Ulster in her right.[1][2][citation needed] In 1270, he and Walter de Ufford, the Justiciar of Ireland, were defeated by Aedh mac Felim Ua Conchobair at Áth an Chip. He married secondly Aveline, daughter of Sir John Fitzgeoffrey, Justiciar of Ireland, by his wife, Isabel Bigod. He died, aged about 40, in Galway, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster ('The Red Earl of Ulster'). Other children were three sons, Theobald, William and Thomas, and daughter, Egidia, who married Sir James Stewart (1260\u20131309), 5th High Steward of Scotland.[3][4]","Title":"Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19613","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_de_Burgh,_1st_Earl_of_Ulster"}
