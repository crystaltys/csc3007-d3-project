{"Content: ":"A financial centre (BE), financial center (AE), or financial hub, is a location with a concentration of participants in banking, asset management, insurance or financial markets with venues and supporting services for these activities to take place.[2][3] Participants can include financial intermediaries (such as banks and brokers), institutional investors (such as investment managers, pension funds, insurers, and hedge funds), and issuers (such as companies and governments). Trading activity can take place on venues such as exchanges and involve clearing houses, although many transactions take place over-the-counter (OTC), that is directly between participants. Financial centres usually host companies that offer a wide range of financial services, for example relating to mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, or corporate actions; or which participate in other areas of finance, such as private equity, hedge funds, and reinsurance. Ancillary financial services include rating agencies, as well as provision of related professional services, particularly legal advice and accounting services.[4] The International Monetary Fund's classes of major financial centers are: International Financial Centres (IFCs), such as New York City,[5] London and Tokyo; Regional Financial Centres (RFCs), such as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Frankfurt, and Sydney; and Offshore Financial Centres (OFCs), such as Cayman Islands, Dublin, Hong Kong, and Singapore.[a] International Financial Centres, and many Regional Financial Centres, are full\u2013service financial centres with direct access to large capital pools from banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and listed capital markets, and are major global cities. Offshore Financial Centres, and also some Regional Financial Centres, tend to specialise in tax-driven services, such as corporate tax planning tools, tax\u2013neutral vehicles,[b] and shadow banking/securitization, and can include smaller locations (e.g. Luxembourg), or city-states (e.g. Singapore). The IMF notes an overlap between Regional Financial Centres and Offshore Financial Centres (e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore are both Offshore Financial Centres and Regional Financial Centres). Since 2010, academics consider Offshore Financial Centres synonymous with tax havens.[c] In April 2000, the Financial Stability Forum (\"FSF\"),[d] concerned about OFCs on global financial stability produced a report listing 42 OFCs.[8] In June 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a working paper on OFCs, but which also proposed a taxonomy on classifying the various types of global financial centres, which they listed as follows (with the description and examples they noted as typical of each category, also noted):[9] The IMF noted that the three categories were not mutually exclusive and that various locations could fall under the definition of an OFC and an RFC, in particular (e.g. Singapore and Hong Kong were cited).[9] The IMF noted that OFCs could be set up for legitimate purposes (listing various reasons), but also for what the IMF called dubious purposes, citing tax evasion and money\u2013laundering. In 2007, the IMF produced the following definition of an OFC: a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy.[10] The FSF annual reports on global shadow banking use the IMF definition to track the OFCs with the largest financial centres relative to their domestic economies.[11] Progress from 2000 onwards from IMF\u2013OECD\u2013FATF initiatives on common standards, regulatory compliance, and banking transparency, has reduced the regulatory attraction of OFCs over IFCs and RFCs. Since 2010, academics considered the services of OFCs to be synonymous with tax havens, and use the term OFC and tax haven interchangeably (e.g. the academic lists of tax havens include all the FSF\u2013IMF OFCs).[6][7] In July 2017, a study by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET group, broke down the definition of an OFC into two subgroups, Conduit and Sink OFCs:[12] Sink OFCs rely on Conduit OFCs to re\u2013route funds from high\u2013tax locations using base erosion and profit shifting (\"BEPS\") tax planning tools, which are encoded, and accepted, in the Conduit OFC's extensive networks of global bilateral tax treaties. Because Sink OFCs are more closely associated with traditional tax havens, they tend to have more limited treaty networks and access to global higher\u2013tax locations. Prior to the 1960s, there was little data available to rank financial centres.[13]:\u200a1\u200a In recent years many rankings have been developed and published. Two of the most relevant are the Global Financial Centres Index and the Xinhua\u2013Dow Jones International Financial Centres Development Index.[14] The Global Financial Centres Index (\"GFCI\") is compiled semi-annually by the London-based think tank Z/Yen in conjunction with the Shenzhen-based think tank China Development Institute.[15] As of 24 March 2022, the top global financial centres per the GFCI article containing a ranked list of 119 financial centres were:[16] The Xinhua\u2013Dow Jones International Financial Centers Development Index was compiled annually by the Xinhua News Agency of China with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Dow Jones & Company of the United States from 2010 to 2014. During that time New York was the top-ranked centre. According to the 2014 Xinhua\u2013Dow Jones International Financial Centres Development Index (IFCD), the top ten financial centres in the world were:[17] (Δ) Appears on the FSF\u2013IMF Offshore Financial Centre (OFC) Lists. (\u2020) Also appears as one of the top 5 Conduit OFC, in CORPNET's 2017 research; or (\u2021) Also appears as one of the top 5 Sink OFC, in CORPNET's 2017 research. Old finance centers such as Amsterdam, London, Paris, and New York have long histories.[20][21] Today there is a diverse range of financial centres worldwide.[22] While New York and London often stand out as the leading global financial centres,[23][24] other established financial centres provide significant competition and several newer financial centres are developing.[25] Despite this proliferation of financial centres, academics have discussed evidence showing increasing concentration of financial activity in the largest national and international financial centres in the 21st century.[26]:\u200a24\u201334\u200a Others have discussed the ongoing dominance of New York and London, and the role linkages between these two financial centres played in the financial crisis of 2007\u201308.[27] Comparisons of financial centres focus on their history, role and significance in serving national, regional and international financial activity. Each centre's offering includes differing legal, tax and regulatory environments.[28] One journalist suggested three factors for success as a financial city: \"a pool of capital to lend or invest; a decent legal and taxation framework; and high-quality human resources\".[29] New York, London, and Tokyo are in every list of major IFCs. Some of the major RFCs (see below), such as Paris, Frankfurt, Chicago, and Shanghai appear as IFCs in some lists. These centres appear in all FSF\u2013IMF lists of OFCs and, bar the Caribbean OFCs of the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda, represent all the major OFCs. Some also appear as RFCs in various lists, particularly Hong Kong, and Singapore. They also appear on most lists of major tax havens, and on lists of the largest Conduit and Sink OFCs in the world. In some lists, RFCs such as Paris, Frankfurt, Chicago, and Shanghai appear as IFCs, however, they do not appear in all lists. They are certainly major RFCs. Primitive financial centres started in the 11th century in the Kingdom of England at the annual fair of St. Giles and in the Kingdom of Germany at the Frankfurt autumn fair, then developed in medieval France during the Champaign Fairs.[108][85] The first real international financial center was the City State of Venice which slowly emerged from the 9th century to its peak in the 14th century.[108] Tradable bonds as a commonly used type of security, were invented by the Italian city-states (such as Venice and Genoa) of the late medieval and early Renaissance periods while Florence can be said to be the birthplace of double-entry bookkeeping from the publication and proliferation of the work of Luca Pacioli. In the sixteenth century, the overall economic supremacy of the Italian city-states gradually waned, and the centre of financial activities in Europe shifted to the Low Countries, first to Bruges, and later to Antwerp and Amsterdam which acted as Entrepôt cities. They also became important centres of financial innovation, capital accumulation and investment.[citation needed] By the early 1800s, London officially replaced Amsterdam as the world's leading financial centre. London and Paris were the world's only prominent financial centers throughout most of the 19th century.[13]:\u200a1\u200a After 1870, Berlin and New York grew to become major financial centres mainly serving their national economies. An array of smaller international financial centers found market niches, such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, and Geneva. London was the leading international financial center in the four decades before World War I.[13]:\u200a74\u201375\u200a[20]:\u200a12\u201315\u200a Since then, New York and London have developed leading positions in different activities and some non-Western financial centres have grown in prominence, notably Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. London has been a leading international financial centre since the 19th century, acting as a centre of lending and investment around the world.[13]:\u200a74\u201375\u200a[109]:\u200a149\u200a English contract law was adopted widely for international finance, with legal services provided in London.[110] Financial institutions located there provided services internationally such as Lloyd's of London (founded 1686) for insurance and the Baltic Exchange (founded 1744) for shipping.[111] During the 20th century London played an important role in the development of new financial products such as the Eurodollar and Eurobonds in the 1960s, international asset management and international equities trading in the 1980s, and derivatives in the 1990s.[20]:\u200a13\u200a[4]:\u200a6,\u200a12\u201313,\u200a88\u20139\u200a[43] London continues to maintain a leading position as a financial centre in the 21st century, and maintains the largest trade surplus in financial services around the world.[112][113][114] However, like New York, it faces new competitors including fast-rising eastern financial centres such as Hong Kong and Shanghai. London is the largest centre for derivatives markets,[115] foreign exchange markets,[116] money markets,[117] issuance of international debt securities,[118] international insurance,[119] trading in gold, silver and base metals through the London bullion market and London Metal Exchange,[120] and international bank lending.[4]:\u200a2\u200a[43][121] London has the second largest concentration of hedge funds (847 according to HedgeLists.com). London benefits from its position between the Asia and U.S. time zones,[122] and benefited from its location within the European Union,[55]:\u200a1\u200a although this ended on 31 January 2020 when the United Kingdom left the European Union following the Brexit referendum of 2016. As well as the London Stock Exchange, the Bank of England, the second oldest central bank, is in London, although the European Banking Authority moved to Paris after Brexit.[123][124] Since the middle of the 20th century, New York City, represented by Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District, has been described as a leading financial centre.[13]:\u200a1\u200a[26]:\u200a25\u200a[27]:\u200a4\u20135\u200a Over the past few decades, with the rise of a multipolar world with new regional powers and global capitalism, numerous financial centres have challenged Wall Street, particularly London and several in Asia, which some analysts believe will be the focus of new worldwide growth.[31]:\u200a39\u201349\u200a[125] One source described New York as extending its lead as the world's centre of finance in September 2018; according to Reuters, the think-tank New Financial concluded the \"raw\" value of domestic and international financial activity like managing assets and issuing equity underscored the position of New York as the world's leading financial centre.[33] New York City remains the largest centre for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy.[31]:\u200a31\u201332\u200a[126] The NYSE and NASDAQ are the two largest stock exchanges in the world.[35] New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment banks and investment managers headquartered in New York City are important participants in other financial centres.[31]:\u200a34\u201335\u200a The New York Federal Reserve Bank, the largest within the Federal Reserve System, regulates financial institutions and implements U.S. monetary policy,[36][127] which in turn influences the world's economy.[128][129] The three major global credit rating agencies \u2013 Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, and Fitch Ratings \u2013 are headquartered or co\u2013headquartered in New York City, with Fitch being co\u2013headquartered in London. In Asia, Tokyo emerged as a major financial centre in the 1980s as the Japanese economy became one of the largest in the world.[13]:\u200a1\u200a Hong Kong and Singapore developed soon after leveraging their links with London and Britain.[27]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a[77] In the 21st century, other centres have grown including Toronto, Sydney, Seoul, Shanghai and Nur-Sultan. Astana International Financial Centre has become the fastest growing financial hub in Central Asia. Dubai has become a centre for finance in the Middle East, including for Islamic finance. The rapid rise of India has enabled Mumbai to become an emerging financial centre. India is also making an International Financial Center GIFT City from scratch. GIFT city is now functional and has already won the crown of fastest emerging International Finance Center of South Asia. Linked to the rise of these new IFCs, has seen the rise of \"partner OFCs\" (offshore tax-havens to which funds are routed), such as Taiwan (a major Sink OFC for Asia, and 7th largest global Sink OFC), Mauritius (a major Sink OFC for South Asia, especially India, and Africa, and the 9th largest global Sink OFC). The private nationwide financial system in China was first developed by the Shanxi merchants, with the creation of so-called \"draft banks\". The first draft bank Rishengchang was created in 1823 in Pingyao. Some large draft banks had branches in Russia, Mongolia and Japan to facilitate the international trade. Throughout the nineteenth century, the central Shanxi region became the de facto financial centres of Qing China. With the fall of Qing Dynasty, the financial centers gradually shifted to Shanghai, mainly due to its geographical location at the estuary of the Yangtze River and to the control of customs in China. After the establishment of People's Republic of China, the financial centres in China today are Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.","Title":"Financial centre - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6084","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_center"}
