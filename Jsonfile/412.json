{"Content: ":"Vesperopterylus (meaning \"dusk wing\") is a genus of anurognathid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of China, the geologically youngest member of its group. Notably, Vesperopterylus appears to have a reversed first toe, which would have been suited for gripping; it was likely arboreal, climbing or clinging to tree branches with curved, sharp claws. It also has a relatively short tail, in contrast with its tailless (Jeholopterus) and long-tailed (Dendrorhynchoides) relatives. It was first described and named by LÃ¼ Junchang et al. While the original spelling of the name was Versperopterylus, this was a typo, and was emended by the authors in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.[1] In 2021, a phylogenetic analysis conducted by Xuefang Wei and colleagues recovered Vesperopterylus within the subfamily Anurognathinae, a subfamily within the family Anurognathidae. Within the subfamily, Vesperopterylus was recovered in a derived position, sister taxon to Anurognathus.[2] Below is a cladogram representing their phylogenetic analysis: \"Dimorphodon\" weintraubi Sinomacrops bondei Batrachognathus volans Dendrorhynchoides curvidentatus Luopterus mutoudengensis Jeholopterus ninchengensis Anurognathus ammoni Vesperopterylus lamadongensis   ","Title":"Vesperopterylus - Wikipedia","KeyID":"412","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesperopterylus"}
