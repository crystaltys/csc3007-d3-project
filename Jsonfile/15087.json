Every constituency is represented by at least three representatives. Since 2001, the parity bill binds that the number of women matches the number of men elected to the Assembly. The official language of the Assembly is French. The most recent election was held in 2018 and resulted in a victory of the Tapura Huiraatira, which won 38 seats.[1] Aside from passing legislation and scrutinising the government, the Assembly is responsible for electing the President of French Polynesia for a four-year term.
