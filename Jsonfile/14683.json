{"Content: ":"The president of Mongolia (Mongolian: Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч, Mongol Ulsyn Yerönkhiilögch) is the executive head of state of Mongolia.[2] The current president is Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh. The president is elected by the citizens of Mongolia. Political parties with representation in the State Great Khural nominate candidates. The president serves a non-repeatable six-year term. The president can be removed from office if two-thirds of the Khural find him guilty of abusing his powers or violating his oath.[3] Before inauguration, however, the president-elect must suspend their membership of any political party. Generally, Mongolian leaders have lived at the President\u2019s Residence at the Ikh Tenger Complex (Mongolian: Их тэнгэр цогцолбор). The complex is a protected area in the Bogd Khan Mountain.[6] The residence is located next to the mansions of the Speaker of Parliament and Prime Minister.[6] In 2017, newly-elected president Battulga said that he intended to live in the \"Winter Palace\" in central Ulaanbaatar, also known as the Marshal\u2019s Residence, in a departure from tradition.[7] It is located in the heart of the capital between Peace Avenue and Seoul Street (next to the 1st School and the Russian Embassy). The two story-building was built in 1947 as the residence of Marshal Khorloogiin Choibalsan. It has two luxury rooms and five other rooms as well as 52-80 person capacity banqueting hall.[8]","Title":"President of Mongolia - Wikipedia","KeyID":"14683","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Mongolia"}
