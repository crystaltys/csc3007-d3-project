{"Content: ":"The tallest structure in Frankfurt is the Europaturm, which rises 337 metres (1,106 ft)[1] however, the observation tower is not generally considered a high-rise building as it does not have successive floors that can be occupied. The tallest habitable building in Frankfurt is the Commerzbank Tower, which rises 259 metres (850 ft) and 56 floors.[2] As of October 2020, the fifteenth-tallest building in Europe and the second tallest building in the European Union. The second-tallest building in the city is the Messeturm, which rises 257 metres (843 ft) tall and has 55 floors.[3] The 10 tallest buildings in Germany are located in Frankfurt. Frankfurt is one of the few European cities with a large cluster of high rise building in its downtown area; in many other European cities, skyscraper construction was not well received in the past due to the historical value of existing buildings. For this reason, Frankfurt is sometimes referred to as \"Mainhattan\" (a portmanteau of the local Main river and Manhattan), and Chicago am Main.[4][5][6] Most of Frankfurt's downtown area was destroyed by Allied air bombardment during World War II, and only a small number of the city's landmarks were rebuilt.[7] This left ample room for and little opposition against the construction of modern high-rises in the city. Frankfurt went through a first high-rise building boom in the 1970s; during this time, the city saw the construction of nine buildings over 110 metres (360 ft). From 1984 until 1993, Frankfurt went through another building boom, during which time the city's second-tallest building, Messeturm, and the third-tallest building, Westendstra√üe 1, were completed. The city has now 17 buildings which rise at least 150 metres (490 ft) in height, more than any other city in Germany. Frankfurt entered another building boom in 1997, and has seen the completion of 11 buildings over 100 metres (330 ft), e.g. the city's tallest building, Commerzbank Tower, as well as Main Tower, Opernturm and Tower 185. There are several proposal and approved plans for new skyscrapers, including Millennium Tower, 369 metres (1,211 ft), Four I, 233 metres (764 ft), Four II 173 metres (568 ft), ONE, 190 metres (620 ft) and Bahn Tower, 200 metres (660 ft). As of October 2011, there are 72 high-rise buildings under construction, approved for construction and proposed for construction in Frankfurt.[8] This lists ranks the tallest buildings in Frankfurt that stand at least 329 feet (100 m) tall. Only habitable building are ranked which excludes radio masts and towers, observation towers, steeples, chimneys and other tall architectural structures. These buildings are included for comparison. This lists buildings that once held the title of tallest building in Frankfurt.","Title":"List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6115","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Frankfurt"}
