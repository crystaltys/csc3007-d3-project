{"Content: ":"The Japanese sturgeon, or Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) is a species of fish in the family Acipenseridae found in the Amur River basin in China and Russia. Claims of its presence in the Sea of Japan need confirmation.[5] The species has 11\u201316 dorsal, 34\u201347 lateral, and 7\u201316 ventral scutes. Their dorsal fins have 38\u201353 rays and 20\u201335 anal fin rays. They also have greyish-brown backs and pale ventral sides. The species could reach up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in length, and weight over 190 kg.[6] The species is considered to be critically endangered.[1] The Japanese sturgeon is benthic. Their main food sources are aquatic insect larvae, bone fish and mollusks. One study suggests that the type of aquatic insect larvae eaten by juvenile Japanese sturgeon depends on the season, where Ephemeroptera larvae are eaten more frequently in Spring and Fall, and Chironomidae larvae are eaten more frequently in Summer.[7] The females mature at 9\u201310 years of age, and males at 7\u20138 years. They start to migrate in the autumn. They live for 65 years.[6]   This order Acipenseriformes (Sturgeon and Paddlefish) related article is a stub.
