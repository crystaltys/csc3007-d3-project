The Sakhalin sturgeon is known to be found in either a marine or freshwater environment within demersal depth range. This species is found in brackish waters. They are also native to a tropical climate.[3] The Sakhalin sturgeon has reached the maximum recorded length of about 150 centimeters or about 59 inches as a tall fish.[3] The Sakhalin sturgeon is considered to be a species that migrates up the river from the sea in order to spawn. During the months of April to May, the Sakhalin sturgeon feeds in the freshwater and then returns to the ocean during the summer.[3][4] The Sakhalin sturgeon is recorded to be the colors of olive-green and dark green.

The bottom lip of this species is split into two.[5] The Sakhalin sturgeon is commonly found in the areas of Northwest Pacific, Bering Sea, Tumnin or Datta river, northern Japan, and Korea.[3] This species currently spawns persistently in the Tumnin River.[1] The threats that are affecting the population of the Sakhalin sturgeon include illegal poaching, trawling, accidental bycatch, pollution, and construction of dams.[6] Currently, the species' population is significantly decreasing and is on the brink of extinction.[7] The common names of the Sakhalin sturgeon in various languages include the following: According to recent genetic data,[9] the differences between the mitogenomes of the Sakhalin sturgeon (Acipenser mikadoi) and the Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to correspond to the variability at the intraspecific level. The time since the divergence of the Sakhalin sturgeon and the Green sturgeon may be approximately 160,000 years.[citation needed] ","Title":"Sakhalin sturgeon - Wikipedia","KeyID":"11595","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin_sturgeon"}
