{"Content: ":"The Jonas Brothers (/ˈdʒoʊnəs/) are an American pop rock band. Formed in 2005, they gained popularity from their appearances on the Disney Channel television network. They consist of three brothers: Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas.[1][2][3] Raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey, the Jonas Brothers moved to Little Falls, New Jersey, in 2005, where they wrote their first record that made its Hollywood Records release.[4] In mid-2008, they starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock and its sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. They also starred as Kevin, Joe, and Nick Lucas from the band, JONAS, in their own Disney Channel series Jonas, which was rebranded as Jonas L.A. after the first season and cancelled after the second. The band have released five albums: It's About Time (2006), Jonas Brothers (2007), A Little Bit Longer (2008), Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), and Happiness Begins (2019). In 2008, the group was nominated for the Best New Artist award at the 51st Grammy Awards and won the award for Breakthrough Artist at the American Music Awards. As of May 2009, before the release of Lines, Vines and Trying Times, they had sold over eight million albums worldwide.[5] After a hiatus during 2010 and 2011 to pursue solo-projects, the group reconciled in 2012 to record a new album, which was cancelled following their break-up on October 29, 2013. They have sold over 17 million albums worldwide as of 2013.[6][7] Six years following their split, the group reunited with the release of \"Sucker\" on March 1, 2019.[8] The song became the 34th song in history to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and became the Jonas Brothers' first number one single on the chart.[9] Their fifth studio album, Happiness Begins, was released on June 7, 2019, topping the US Billboard 200.[10] In 2005, Joe, Kevin and Nick recorded \"Please Be Mine\", their first song recorded.[11] Upon hearing the song, the Columbia Records president Steve Greenberg decided to sign the brothers as a group.[12] They considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name Jonas Brothers.[13] While working on their debut studio album, the band toured throughout 2005 with artists such as Jump5, Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five among others.[14] They spent the latter portion of the year on a tour with Aly & AJ and The Cheetah Girls. Additionally, they opened for The Veronicas in early 2006. For their first album, titled It's About Time, the band collaborated with several writers, including Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Michael Mangini (Joss Stone), Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Billy Mann (Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson) and Steve Greenberg. The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times, due to executive changes at Sony (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have \"another lead single\" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band Busted \u2013 \"Year 3000\" and \"What I Go to School For\". The Jonas Brothers' first single, \"Mandy\", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's Total Request Live on February 22, 2006, and reached number four. Another song, \"Time for Me to Fly\", was released on the Aquamarine soundtrack, also in February. In March, \"Mandy\" was featured in the Nickelodeon television film Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up and the Zoey 101: Music Mix soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on Cartoon Network's Friday night programming block Fridays.[14] The band covered \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean for the Disneymania 4 album, released on April 4, 2006.[15] Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of American Dragon: Jake Long, airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the Disney Channel.[16] It's About Time was finally released on August 8, 2006.[17] According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of 50,000 copies, so the album's price can rise as high as $200\u2013$300 USD on auction sites like eBay. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers considered switching labels. On October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\", was re-released on Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection.[18] The same month, the Jonas Brothers covered \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disc special-edition release of The Little Mermaid soundtrack.[19] The second single from It's About Time was \"Year 3000\", the music video of which premiered on the Disney Channel in January 2007. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007. After being without a label for a short time, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007.[20] Around the same time, the brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle.[21] On March 24, two additional songs on two different albums were released: \"Kids of the Future\", from the Meet the Robinsons soundtrack[22] (based on Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\"), and \"I Wanna Be Like You\", from Disneymania 5.[23] The Jonas Brothers made their first appearance at the White House on Monday, April 9, 2007, during the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, where they sang the National Anthem.[24] They returned on Wednesday June 27, 2007, during a Celebrating Women in Sports Tee Ball game on the South Lawn. They sang the National Anthem again, and, after the game, the Jonas Brothers entertained at the picnic-reception with a selection of their hits.[25] Their self-titled second album was released on August 7, 2007.[26] It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week. Two singles with music videos were also released around this time \u2013 \"Hold On\" two weeks before, and \"S.O.S.\", four days before the release of the album.
