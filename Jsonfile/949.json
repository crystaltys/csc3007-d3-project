{"Content: ":"Tripedalism (from the Latin tri = three + ped = foot) is locomotion by the use of three legs. It has been said that parrots (Psittaciformes) display tripedalism during climbing gaits,[2] which was tested and proven in a 2022 paper on the subject, making parrots the only creatures to truly use tripedal forms of locomotion.[1] Tripedal gaits were also observed by K. Hunt[3] in primates. This is usually observed when the animal is using one limb to grasp a carried object and is thus a non-standard gait. Apart from parrots, there are no known species where three limbs are standard, although the movement of some macropods such as kangaroos, which can alternate between resting their weight on their muscular tails and their two hind legs and hop on all three, may be an example of tripedal locomotion in animals. There are also the tripod fish. Several species of these fish rest on the ocean bottom on two rays from its two pelvic fins and one ray from its caudal fin.[4] Tripedalism contrasts with the common bipedalism of two-legged animals and quadrupedalism of four-legged animals. There are some three-legged creatures in the world today, namely four-legged animals (such as pet dogs and cats) who have had one limb amputated. With proper medical treatment most of these injured animals can go on to live fairly normal lives, despite being artificially tripedal. There are also cases of mutations or birth abnormalities in animals (including humans) which have resulted in three legs.[citation needed]","Title":"Tripedalism - Wikipedia","KeyID":"949","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripedal"}
