{"Content: ":"The White House's art collection, sometimes also called the White House Collection or Pride of the American Nation,[1] has grown over time from donations from descendants of the Founding Fathers to commissions by established artists.[2] It comprises paintings, sculptures, and other art forms.[3]At times, the collection grows from a president's specific request, such as when Ronald Reagan began collecting the work of naval artist Tom Freeman in 1986, a tradition that continued through the Obama years.[4] The White House's Art collection was established by an Act of Congress in 1961 and grew extensively during the Kennedy Administration.[5] It now includes more than 65,000 objects if individual items are catalogued.[6] As of 2021, there are more than 500 pieces on view under the care of the White House Curator and the White House Historical Association,[7] and these are often complemented by those on loan from museums.[8][6][9] Portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, 1796 Portrait of John Adams by John Trumbull, c.\u20091792−1793 Portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800 Portrait of Andrew Jackson by Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl, c.\u20091835 Portrait of William Henry Harrison by James Reid Lambdin, 1835 Portrait of Millard Fillmore by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1857 Portrait of John Quincy Adams by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1858 Portrait of Franklin Pierce by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1858 Portrait of Martin Van Buren by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1858 Portrait of James Knox Polk by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1858 Portrait of John Tyler by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1864 Portrait of Abraham Lincoln by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1869 Portrait of Theodore Roosevelt by John Singer Sargent, 1902 Portrait of William Howard Taft by Anders Zorn, 1911 Portrait of Franklin D.
