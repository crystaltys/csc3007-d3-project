{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Newfoundland and Labrador is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of July 20, 2022, there have been 49,200 cases and 202 deaths confirmed in Newfoundland and Labrador. As of July 20, 2022, 692,026 tests have been completed. *As of March 15, 2022, the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador will no longer provide the number of people who recovered from COVID-19, or the exact number of known, active cases. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador has the ninth-most cases (out of ten provinces and three territories) of COVID-19 in Canada. Despite figures from COVID-19 Tracker Canada, the province is leading the country with the highest vaccination rates for first and second doses for those aged 12 and older, as well as kids aged 5\u201311.[2] The province announced its first presumptive case on March 14, 2020, and declared a public health emergency on March 18. Health orders, including the closure of non-essential businesses, and mandatory self-isolation for all travelers entering the province (even from within Canada) were enacted over the days that followed. After the initial outbreaks, the number of cases in Newfoundland remained relatively low, with several stretches of days with no cases over early-to-mid-2020. The province began a gradual lifting of restrictions on a five-stage scale on May 11, 2020. Cases continued to remain relatively low and stable over the summer months of 2020, although several clusters (including the first case involving a school student) emerged in November and December. In February 2021, the province began to experience a major surge in new cases and community transmission, including its largest single-day increases to-date. On February 12, 2021, a second lockdown was declared after samples from these cases tested positive for the highly-transmissible SARS-CoV2 variant B.1.1.7. The province began to emerge from the second lockdown on February 27, returning to its prior state (Alert Level 2) with modifications on March 27, 2021. Following the return to Alert Level 2 on March 27, 2021, cases remained low up until mid-December when they began to rise again as a result of multiple outbreaks caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in Western Health and the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in Central, Eastern and Labrador-Grenfell Health authorities; Western Health began experiencing a surge in cases, again, due to Omicron in mid-January. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald moved the entire province to Alert Level 3 on December 23, 2021, and will remain there until January 10, 2022. Officials will reexamine where the province is in terms of epidemiology and make their decisions to move the province back to its previous level or keep the province where it's too, based on the evidence.[3] However, on January 3, 2022, following days of high case counts and active caseloads, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, Premier Andrew Furey and Eastern Health Authority CEO David Diamond held an unexpected media briefing to announce that the entire province will move to a modified Alert Level 4, effective midnight on January 4, 2022. Dr. Fitzgerald stated this move is necessary due to Public Health operating at 100% capacity in trying to identify cases and their close contacts. Fitzgerald also asked those who are sick and showing symptoms of COVID-19 to assume they have the virus and isolate immediately, not to get tested, and notify their close contacts. Only those who are close contacts of a case and not showing symptoms of COVID-19 will avail to a PCR test; this will help ease the strain on the health-care system. This move to a modified Alert Level 4 will last for two weeks, at which time it will be reassessed.[4] On January 17, 2022, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced that the province will remain in Alert Level 4 until at least January 24, 2022. This is based on current epidemiological trends and hospitalizations.[5] On January 31, 2022, officials opted to keep the province in modified Alert Level 4 due to rising hospitalizations and will reassess on February 4, 2022. Dr. Fitzgerald announced the province will be moving to a modified Alert Level 3 effective 12:01AM, Saturday, February 5, 2022. Fitzgerald said the province will move to a modified Alert Level 2 on February 21, 2022, if the epidemiology and hospitalizations stay consistent.[6] During a media briefing on February 8, 2022, Dr. Fitzgerald announced that effective immediately, the province will no longer issue Alert Level restrictions. The province will, therefore, post restrictions and changes on the COVID-19 website. As of Monday, February 14, 2022, restaurants and bars can operate at 50% with a table size of 10, formal gatherings, theatres, bingo halls, gyms and arenas can operate at 50% capacity, with regional sports returning but competitions are still prohibited, as are dancing inside bars. On February 16, 2022, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, Premier Andrew Furey, and Minister John Haggie held a live media briefing to announce the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, which Premier Furey stated \"the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter every day.\" Dr. Fitzgerald went on to announce that effective February 21, 2022, informal gatherings can be increased to 25 people, faith-based gatherings, gyms and restaurants can increase to 75% (with NLVaxPass), sports will be allowed to compete out of region but with one game a day (no tournaments), and bars and theatres will remain at 50%. Effective February 28, 2022, border and travel restrictions will be eliminated, allowing all travelers to enter the province without having to isolate or be tested, but rapid testing will be voluntary. By March 14, 2022, the province is anticipating dropping all restrictions on masking, proof of vaccination, and gathering limits, however, Dr. Fitzgerald stated that public health will continue to highly recommend wearing a mask wherever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Fitzgerald said the measures currently in place were needed to ensure the hospitals did not get overrun during the Omicron wave, and that the province appears to \"have passed the peak\". Dr. Fitzgerald also made it known that the restrictions were not being loosened because of the ongoing Canada convoy protest, but were being loosened based on the science, which they have been following since the start of the pandemic. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald and Health Minister John Haggie held a media briefing on March 2, 2022, where they announced that Newfoundland and Labrador is on track to have all COVID-19 restrictions lifted by March 14, 2022. Fitzgerald said the province is seeing an uptick in cases, but they are less severe than previous waves and hospitalizations are remaining steady. Dr. Fitzgerald reiterated that \"life will not change back to the way it was in 2019 when the special measures orders end\", so Newfoundlanders and Labradorians should continue practicing physical distancing and masking where possible. John Haggie stated \"the disease has evolved, making it more likely everyone will acquire it, but less likely to be hospitalized\", and that hospitalizations is what public health is focusing on moving forward. As restrictions lift, the province will see a slight increase of cases in children; however, lots of children who have been vaccinated have had it, Dr. Fitzgerald said, and with the province \"leading the world\" in children who are fully-vaccinated, the increase in cases may not be as drastic. During the final live media briefing on March 9, 2022, Dr. Fitzgerald announced that 15-20% of the total population of the province \"likely have had COVID-19 at this point\". Dr. Haggie announced that as of Monday, March 14, 2022, at 12:01AM, he will be repealing the state of emergency in the province and all special measures orders will be lifted, including masking, however, Dr. Fitzgerald stated that public health will continue to strongly recommend masking until mid-April when the warm weather arrives and people move outdoors. On November 19, 2021, Public Health Agency of Canada approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged five to 11.[7] On November 21, 2021, Canada received 2.9 million dosages, enough to inoculate every child in the country with their first shot, and expected the rollout to begin that same week.[8] Appointments were made available on the province's online portal on November 24, 2021, with officials expecting vaccines to arrive in the province on November 26, 2021.[9] However, the dosages arrived earlier than expected and the rollout began immediately. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald administered some of the first shots, with a nine-year-old boy receiving his by Fitzgerald herself. He told reporters he was not nervous whatsoever, and besides a sore arm he was feeling no side effects. He and Dr. Fitzgerald celebrated with a high-five afterwards.[10] As of July 20, 2022, 82.1% of the population aged 5\u201311 have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 65.6% of the population aged 5\u201311 are fully vaccinated.[11] On March 14, the first presumptive case was announced in the province's capital city of St. John's.[1] On March 16, this increased to three cases. Chief Medical Officer Janice Fitzgerald stated that these new cases \"are contacts to the previous case and are not unexpected.\"[12] The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District announced that it had suspended in-person classes.[13] A public health emergency was officially declared by Health Minister John Haggie on March 18, which introduced the first wave of health orders enforceable by law, with fines of $2,500 and up to six years imprisonment for individuals, and up to $50,000 for companies.[14] On March 18, 2020, the province began to enact orders pursuant to the public health emergency; public gatherings were restricted to 50 people, and all arenas, bars, cinemas, and gyms were ordered closed. Restaurants were limited to 50% in-person capacity.[14] On March 20, the province mandated that anyone entering Newfoundland, including from other provinces, must self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.[15] On March 21, Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation stores were closed to in-person shopping.[15][16] On March 23, the province ordered the closure of personal care services and non-essential retail stores. Gatherings were also limited to 10 people, and visitation at long-term care homes was prohibited province-wide that evening.[17] On March 23, the number of cases in Newfoundland and Labrador increased to 24.[17] On March 24, a woman was arrested in Corner Brook for refusing to self-isolate after she returned from a trip outside the province.[18] By March 25, the number of cases had risen to 67; 44 of them were associated with an outbreak at Caul's Funeral Home in St. John's, which occurred between March 15 and 17.[19][20] On March 30, the province reported Newfoundland's first COVID-19-related death, a 78-year-old with underlying conditions. The case had been linked to the Caul's outbreak. The province reached 148 cases.[21] By mid-April, the number of daily cases had lessened, including streaks of days with no new cases at all.[22] By April 30, 2020, there had been 258 cases and 3 deaths in Newfoundland and Labrador, no new cases in the last four days, and only two in the past 13. Fitzgerald announced a plan to gradually lift restrictions using a five-tier framework of \"Alert Levels\", with the existing restrictions classified as Alert Level 5. One immediate change was that households were now allowed to form a \"bubble\" with one other household for close contacts.[23] On May 4, 2020, Newfoundland enacted a strict ban on entry into the province by non-residents unless otherwise exempted.[24] On May 5, 2020, the House of Assembly passed a bill to amend the Public Health Protection and Promotion Act, authorizing police officers to stop vehicles, enter any premises, and detain people and take them to the border if they are not complying with public health measures.[25][26][27] On May 7, 2020, the province reported its first increase in active cases since April 6.[28] Newfoundland and Labrador entered \"Alert Level 4\" on May 11, which allowed some businesses and low-risk recreational activities to resume.[29] On May 20, the province reported its first new case in 20 days, bringing its total to 261. The case was identified as being related to travel.[30] The province advanced to \"Alert Level 3\" on June 8, allowing the reopening of non-essential retail, in-person dining at restaurants, and \"medium-risk\" outdoor recreation. Fitzgerald stated that only one new, aforementioned case tied to travel had been recorded during the timeframe of Alert Level 4. She stated that the province could transition to \"Alert Level 2\" within at least three weeks, but that \"there's a lot of things that we would be considering, and no one thing in particular will necessarily make that decision for us.\"[31][32] On June 17, Fitzgerald announced that the province would move to Alert Level 2 on June 25, after having lasted 20 days without new cases.[33] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that an \"Atlantic Bubble\" would be formed beginning July 3, under which residents of the Atlantic provinces would be able to travel between them without self-isolation requirements. Travel into the bubble from outside of the provinces would still be subject to restrictions, and was subject to rules enforced on a provincial basis.[34][35] By July 3, Newfoundland had gone 36 days without new COVID-19 cases.[36] On July 10, the 43-day streak ended with one new case announced, involving a traveler who had recently returned from Ontario.[37] On July 21, Newfoundland reported another new case related to travel, followed by one more involving a close contact of said patient.[38] On August 17, 2020, Fitzgerald announced that the province would mandate the wearing of face masks within enclosed public spaces beginning August 24.[39] The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District also unveiled its back-to-school plan for K-12 students.[40] On October 3, 2020, the province reported its fourth COVID-19-related death, its first since April. The patient had returned from Central Africa on September 29, and died on October 1.[41] On November 18, 2020, Fitzgerald identified a potential outbreak at the Blue Crest Cottages retirement home in Grand Bank, with a cluster of four cases tied to the facility.[42] On November 22, 2020, amid an increase in cases over the weekend in Newfoundland, the town council of Deer Lake issued a request for all non-essential businesses to close through December 7.[43] On November 23, 2020, the province announced that it had detected the first COVID-19 case within its school system, involving a student at Elwood Elementary in Deer Lake. Education Minister Tom Osborne announced that Elwood Elementary would close for the next two days.[44] Premier Andrew Furey announced that Newfoundland would suspend its participation in the Atlantic Bubble for at least 14 days.[45][46] By December 4, 2020, the province had reached 343 total cases, with 27 active. Premier Furey announced that the province had established a logistics team for distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and stated that they would be \"highly suggested\" but not mandatory.[47] On December 5, 2020, a cluster was identified in Harbour Breton after three people tested positive. Out of an abundance of caution, classes were suspended at St. Joseph's Elementary and King Academy on December 7.[48][49] A mobile testing clinic was set up in the community, with public health officials encouraging all residents to be tested.[50] On February 8, 2021, 11 new cases were reported, in Newfoundland's largest single-day increase since April 2020. The province reported that there had been a large number of close contacts associated with two positive cases at a St. John's high school.[51] 30 cases were reported on February 9, all in the Eastern health region. It was the province's second largest daily increase to-date. Fitzgerald stated that this was evidence of wide community transmission, and ordered a circuit breaker in St. John's effective at midnight. Gatherings held by \"recognized\" businesses and organizations were restricted to 20 participants, restaurants were capped at 50% capacity, and all recreational facilities were ordered closed.[52][53] On February 10, the province reported a single-day high of 53 new cases, with most said to be among those under the age of 20, and all among residents of the Eastern health region (including one who was tested in Central but resides in Eastern). Fitzgerald warned that low case counts in the province had led to complacency, and that \"we are now seeing the repercussions.\" Additional restrictions were also announced, including the closure of all non-essential businesses in the St. John's metropolitan area, and the province-wide suspension of all group and team sports, and all group arts and cultural activities involving close contact.[54] The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District suspended all in-person classes in the area through at least February 26.[55] On February 11, Newfoundland announced 100 new cases, its largest increase to-date, with all but one in the Eastern health region. The province issued various self-isolation orders for students who had participated in gatherings or team sports within the St. John's area, and made anyone showing a COVID-19 symptom eligible to receive testing. Fitzgerald commented on the surge, explaining that \"'I'm not trying to say that they did anything wrong; I just think that it's what got us to where we are, I'm not judging anybody; it's just what has gotten us here and what we need to change so that we can get ourselves out of here.\" Fitzgerald also stated that health officials were sending out samples to be sequenced for SARS-CoV-2 variants.[56] In-person voting for 18 ridings in the 2021 Newfoundland and Labrador general election was postponed indefinitely.[56] On February 12, the province announced 50 new cases.[57] Later that night, Fitzgerald announced that 19 samples sent to a laboratory in Winnipeg had sequenced for Lineage B.1.1.7 (the \"UK variant\"), and that all recent outbreaks would be assumed to have involved this strain. Fitzgerald therefore declared a second lockdown with a province-wide rollback to Alert Level 5, including the closure of all non-essential businesses, and strict restrictions on gatherings. It was concurrently announced that due to the lockdown, all in-person voting for the 2021 general election would be cancelled, with the election being conducted exclusively with mail-in ballots\u2014the first election to do so in Canadian history.[58][59][60] On February 24, the province announced its fifth COVID-19-related death, its first since October 2020. Fitzgerald stated that an update on provincial restrictions would be issued on February 26, but that \"as long as the variant circulates outside our province, it will make its way back into our province. This means we are always at risk for another outbreak if we don't remain vigilant.\". She also warned residents to not take the recent decline in cases as a \"false sense of security\".[61] The province confirmed a sixth death and four new cases on February 27.[62] On February 26, 2021, Fitzgerald announced that due to community transmission being limited outside of the St. John's region (with only five presently-active cases being outside of the Eastern region), the rest of the province outside of the Avalon would revert to Alert Level 4 effective 12:01 a.m. on February 27. The Avalon remained at Alert Level 5, and all alert levels would be re-evaluated in two weeks.[63][64] On March 13, all levels were decreased by one, with the Avalon downgraded to Alert Level 4, and the remainder of the province at Alert Level 3.[65] On March 24, Fitzgerald announced that the entire province would return to Alert Level 2 effective 12:01 a.m. on March 27, but with modifications in order to discourage excessive close contacts. Most gatherings will be capped at 50 people, and households may form a social bubble with up to 20 close, consistent contacts. Team sports leagues must obtain permission to resume competitive play by submitting proposals to the health authority.[66] Cases in Newfoundland and Labrador remained relatively low since the province emerged from their second lockdown caused by the Alpha variant in February 2021, which prompted Dr. Fitzgerald to remove Newfoundland and Labrador's mask mandate on August 13, 2021. However, on September 18, 2021, Dr. Fitzgerald reintroduced the mask mandate citing concerns of the highly-contagious Delta variant and the fourth wave worsening in other parts of the country.[67] ed. However, on September 18, 2021, Dr. Fitzgerald reintroduced the mask mandate province-wide citing concerns of the Delta variant in other parts of the country.[68] On September 27, 2021, following an outbreak in Central Newfoundland, health officials announced their eighth new death; the first since February 24, 2021. The man was between the ages of 60\u201369 years of age.[69] On September 28, 2021, health officials announced that Newfoundland and Labrador's participation in the Atlantic Bubble will be suspended on September 30, 2021, until further notice.[70] This requires all travelers, regardless of which province you reside in, to submit the Declaration Form found on the government's website.[71] The suspension is in response to the Delta-driven fourth wave across the Atlantic region, and the change in Newfoundland and Labrador's epidemiology curve. On October 1, 2021, Newfoundland and Labrador announced their ninth and tenth death; a male in the Central Health region and a female in the Eastern Health region, both age 70 years and older.[72] Health officials announced the province's eleventh death on October 8. A female in the Central Health region who was over the age of 70 years.[73] On October 12, 2021, Newfoundland and Labrador announced 21 new COVID-19 cases, 62 recoveries and two deaths over the Thanksgiving long weekend. The two deaths were in the Central Health region and involved two males, one between 60 and 69 years of age and the other over the age of 70 years.[74] The province announced their fourteenth and fifteenth deaths on October 18, 2021, raising the death toll to 15 since the start of the pandemic.[75] On October 27, 2021, health officials announced 20 new COVID-19 cases, nine recoveries, and one death, bringing the death total to 16 since March 2020.[76] Provincial health officials announced their seventeenth death on November 15, 2021. The man, aged 70 years or older, resided in the Central health region.[77] This is the first death in the province related to COVID-19 since October 18, 2021, raising the death toll to 17. Four new cases were announced on November 17, 2021, along with 13 recoveries, leaving 22 active cases; the lowest active case count in months. On November 22, 2021, health officials announced three new cases and 10 recoveries, leaving 12 active cases. The last time the province saw a low active case count was on August 18, 2021.[78] Health officials announced four new cases, two recoveries, and one new death on November 24, 2021. The new death increases the provincial death toll to eighteen. According to officials, the male was a resident in the Central Health region and was over the age of 70 years.[79] Newfoundland and Labrador reported six new COVID-19 cases and five recoveries on Friday, November 26, 2021, leaving the province with 14 active cases.[80] Officials announced nine new cases and two recoveries on November 29, 2021, leaving 21 active cases in the province.[81] Newfoundland and Labrador Health and Community Services announced on December 13, 2021, that based on guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), the province will be changing the eligibility criteria for booster shots. Starting in January 2022, anyone 18 years and older will be eligible to receive a booster shot if six months has passed since they received their primary series. NACI has recommended that individuals in the 18-29 age group should receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for their booster, and anyone 30 years and older should receive the Moderna vaccine for their booster. The media release stated that due to supply issues and the pediatric vaccine rollout, the Pfizer vaccine will only be offered at Public Health clinics.[82] On January 4, 2022, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador announced 100,000 eligible residents received have their booster shots. By February 8, 2022, over 260,000 eligible residents in Newfoundland & Labrador received their booster shots. On January 7, 2022, Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, announced changes in the province's isolation guidelines. This is in response to research surrounding the Omicron variant.[83] Effective 12:01AM on January 8, 2022, the following isolation guidelines will be enforced: Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced on January 12, 2022, that immunocompromised individuals will be offered a fourth dose if 22-weeks have passed since their third dose. This is based on advice from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. On January 20, 2022, Fitzgerald announced that effective Saturday, January 22, 2022, all travelers arriving in the province who are fully-vaccinated can now leave isolation after 24-hours, however, the traveler(s) is required to take two rapid tests (within the 24-hour timeframe) and produce negative results in order to leave isolation. All other isolation requirements remain the same for those partially-vaccinated and unvaccinated. On January 22, 2022, Public Health revised isolation and testing requirements for people who have COVID-19 and their close contacts, to reflect as follows:[84] On February 3, 2022, Premier Furey announced during the live media briefing that effective 12:01AM, Saturday, February 5, 2022, all isolation requirements for fully-vaccinated travellers will be lifted, however, the province will continue to require the use of the provided rapid tests twice within the 24-hour timespan. Furey also announced $9,000,000 in funding for artists and the tourism industry that were hit hard by COVID-19 restrictions. Dr. Fitzgerald announced a plan to lift all long-term health restrictions, starting on February 21, 2022. Providing epidemiology remains favorable in the province, all restrictions, including masking and physical distancing, will be lifted on March 14, 2022, two years to the day that the province reported their first confirmed case. Public Health is also scaling back on the COVID-19 daily updates, with the department reverting to Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's. During the weekly live media briefing on February 24, 2022, Dr. Fitzgerald said that due to the hospitalization rates remaining stable, the province will be moving forward with lifting more restrictions on Monday, February 28, 2022, which will include border control and isolation requirements, meaning anyone can enter the province and will not have to isolate. Fitzgerald also stated that officials are seeing an increase in COVID-19 activity within the province, but said \"It's time to move out of crisis mode and begin a more sustainable approach to managing COVID-19 while we are able to do so.\" Fitzgerald cautioned there will be more waves of COVID in the future, however, they may or may not be as severe; \"that is why it's important to maintain surveillance locally and globally\", said Fitzgerald. As of Monday, February 28, restaurants, gyms and fitness facilities, and religious ceremonies will be able to operate at 75% capacity, as long as NLVaxPass is being used. Also announced were changes in isolation protocols for close contacts. Effective 12:01AM, Friday, February 25, 2022, household contacts who are not fully vaccinated will now have to isolate for five days, a change from the previous 10 day requirement. As well, fully vaccinated asymptomatic household contacts of a positive case can follow a modified five-day isolation protocol, which includes going to work or school, but must self-isolate afterwards. There are no self-isolation or testing requirements for asymptomatic non-household contacts. However, they must monitor for symptoms for one week after the last encounter with the positive case, wear a mask outside their home and avoid crowded areas. If the individual starts showing symptoms of COVID-19, they must self-isolate and book a test immediately. For those who are symptomatic and are a non-household contact, they must self-isolate and follow the testing guidelines found on the government's website. They must self-isolate until symptoms improve and test negative. Minister Haggie stated that there are 1,030 healthcare workers currently in isolation, with 221 of them positive for COVID-19. These new isolation protocols means more healthcare workers can now go back to work earlier than anticipated. Newfoundland and Labrador removed the provincial border controls and travel restrictions on February 28, 2022, allowing all Canadian's to enter the province without having to isolate. These measures required travelers who were partially-vaccinated or non-vaccinated to isolate for a certain amount of days, depending on the traveler's vaccination status, and allowing fully-vaccinated travelers to roam freely without any restrictions or isolation. The travel form that was found on the government's website is no longer required to enter the province. On March 14, 2022, the province removed all COVID-19 restrictions, including masking and the proof of vaccination system. On March 15, 2022, public health debuted a new COVID-19 dashboard, which can be found here. The website no longer supplies the number of active cases, the number of those who recovered, or the number of tests completed. On March 17, 2022, the province further decreased eligibility criteria for PCR testing. Only individuals over 60, children 2 and under, Indigenous peoples, front line healthcare workers, pregnant people, staff in seniors homes or shelters, and the immunocompromised are eligible for testing, if symptomatic. However, public health stated that close contacts of a confirmed case who are symptomatic are still eligible for a PCR test. On April 13, 2022, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced in a live media briefing that the province plans on administering fourth doses to those who are 70 years of age or older, anyone 18 years or older who identify as indigenous or live in an isolated indigenous community, and those in congregate living settings for seniors. Fitzgerald also said those who are between 12 and 17 years of age will soon be able to book their first booster shot appointments, starting on April 25, 2022. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced during a media briefing on May 13, 2022, that students, faculty and staff in K-12 schools will no longer be required to wear masks during school hours, starting May 24, 2022. Public Health will still recommend strong mask wearing, but Fitzgerald said wearing a mask will ultimately be up to the individual. Fitzgerald said, \"we are seeing reduced COVID-19 activity in the province. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 severity have decreased significantly in recent weeks, which is one of the most important indicators at this time.\" She went onto say, \"we in Public Health would not be doing this if we felt that there was a significant increased risk for transmission. As we've done, throughout Omicron in particular when we've loosened restrictions, there may be a little bump,\" and \"that's not unexpected. But we don't anticipate there's going to be a huge increase in transmission with this.\" Fitzgerald also announced that the COVID-19 website will no longer be updated on Monday's, Wednesday's and Friday's. Instead, officials will only update the website weekly on Wednesday's. The province announced on May 26, 2022, that as of June 1, 2022, the vaccine mandate that was introduced in December 2021 for service providers and employees in certain businesses and facilities, will be lifted at this time due to favourable epidemiology. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced on December 15, 2021, during a media briefing that the province has confirmed its first SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant case; the individual, a resident of the Eastern Health region, has been isolating since they returned to the province from travel within Canada. There were also 13 new cases, leaving 34 active cases.[85] Newfoundland and Labrador reported a spike in new cases on December 17, 2021, with officials reporting 46 new cases of COVID-19, along with four recoveries. The province is reporting 76 active cases.[86] Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced during the snap media briefing that the province is also reporting more cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, with numbers unknown at the time due to results still being processed; however, she stated she is certain the tests will become positive for the new variant.

On October 20, 2021, health officials announced a cluster of cases in the Marystown area on the Burin Peninsula. Since then, the investigation into the source has been ongoing. Prior to the announcement, on October 19, 2021, Newfoundland and Labrador's Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Rosann Seviour announced that four schools were involved in the recently announced cases. The schools involved are Bayview Academy in St. George's, Heritage Collegiate in Lethbridge, Anthony Paddon Elementary in Musgravetown, and Sacred Heart Academy in Marystown.[158] On October 22, 2021, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald held a media briefing to announce 30 new COVID-19 cases. She also confirmed that the recently announced cases on the Burin Peninsula, specifically in Marystown, is now forming into a new cluster. As of the same date, there were 25 confirmed cases in the Marystown region, with 22 of those cases involving school-aged children. As a result, Dr. Fitzgerald announced that communities in the Marystown and Burin areas will move to Alert Level 3 effective 12:01am on Saturday, October 23, 2021. The communities affected are: Red Fox Harbour south to Epworth-Grand Salmonier including Rock Harbour, Spanish Room, Beau Bois, Marystown, Burin, Lewin's Cove, Jean de Baie, Fox Cove-Mortier, Frenchman's Cove and Garnish.[159] On October 25, 2021, Public Health officials announced 36 new COVID-19 cases, eight recoveries and no deaths. Out of the 36 new cases, 35 of them were connected to the Marystown cluster, and included 23 cases in those under the age of 20. Marystown mayor Brian Keating announced on VOCM Morning Show on October 25, 2021, that there are now 58 cases linked to the cluster. Later that day, Public Health officials confirmed this number in a news release.[160] Fifteen of the 20 new cases reported on October 27, 2021, were associated with this cluster. As of November 5, 2021, 83 cases have been linked to the Marystown cluster. Also on November 5, 2021, health officials announced that all towns and communities on the Burin Peninsula will return to Alert Level 2, effective immediately. Public health officials stated that although a source has yet to be determined, the risk of residents in this area contracting COVID-19 is deemed low.[161] Health officials announced that as of Monday, November 23, 2021, they have not been able to confirm a source that caused this outbreak. Eighty-four confirmed cases was recorded during the investigation.[162] Public Health officials notified the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD) on October 21, 2021, that a number of students attending Sacred Heart Academy in Marystown had tested positive for COVID-19. This prompted the NLESD to move classes to online learning, effective immediately, until Public Health says otherwise.[163] Three days later on October 24, 2021, the NLESD announced that a student attending Donald C. Jamieson Academy in Burin had tested positive for COVID-19 and students will be transitioning to online learning effective Tuesday, October 26, with Monday, October 25, being a transition day for teachers to gather their resources. The NLESD announced on October 26, 2021, that two students at Pearce Junior High School in Marystown have tested positive for COVID-19.[164] Furthermore, the District also announced the same day that a \"small number\" of students at Marystown Central High School may have been exposed to COVID-19 after a student tested positive.[165] Unlike the elementary schools that are experiencing an outbreak in the same area, the District opted to keep both schools open, rather than moving students to online learning until the investigation is completed. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Janice Fitzgerald held a media briefing on October 29, 2021, and announced that the Delta variant was the cause of the outbreak currently happening in the Marystown area. Moreover, Dr. Fitzgerald announced that the COVID protocols in elementary schools have been amended and will include masking for all children in grades K-3. Prior to this, masking was required for children from grades 4\u201312. Regulated child care centres were also included and staff at those centres will now be required to wear a mask.[166] The NLESD announced on November 2, 2021, that both Anthony Paddon Elementary and Heritage Collegiate can return to a \"low risk\" protocol, meaning both schools will resume in-person learning.[167][168] On April 30, Fitzgerald unveiled A Foundation for Living with COVID-19, a framework of five Alert Levels that would allow for restrictions to be gradually lifted. Fitzgerald explained that the term \"alert level\" was used rather than terms such as \"phase\", to encourage residents to remain \"alert, vigilant and aware\" even at lower levels.[23] All alert levels are subject to other public health orders and guidance, including practicing social distancing, proper hygiene, wearing face masks when in an enclosed public space, limiting non-essential travel, and conducting remote work whenever possible.[169] On March 18, 2020, Newfoundland mandated that anyone entering the province from outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days upon their return.[14] On March 20, Newfoundland mandated that anyone entering the province from elsewhere in Canada must also self-isolate.[15] On April 22, a partial exception was introduced for employees of the agriculture, hydroelectricity, mining, oil and gas, transport, and trade sectors; they must still self-isolate from the general public for 14 days, but may attend work if they do not show any signs of COVID-19 symptoms.[171] On May 4, 2020, the province enacted a strict travel ban; only residents of the province, employees of the aforementioned industrial businesses, and those otherwise approved by the Chief Medical Officer, are allowed to travel into Newfoundland.[24] On May 20, 2020, the travel ban was challenged in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador by Nova Scotia resident Kim Taylor and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. Taylor had been barred from entering the province to attend her mother's funeral, and argued that the travel ban violated the guarantee of freedom of movement in Section 6 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[172] In September 2020, the Court upheld the ban. Although agreeing with the opinion that the ban did violate Section 6 of the Charter, Justice Donald Burrage ruled that the ban was a reasonable limit as allowed by Section 1. He stated that \"while restrictions on personal travel may cause mental anguish to some, and certainly did in the case of Ms. Taylor, the collective benefit to the population as a whole must prevail\", and that \"[her] right to mobility must give way to the common good.\"[173] Due to the number of cases within Atlantic Canada being relatively low, Premier of Prince Edward Island Dennis King suggested in June 2020 that a travel corridor could be formed among them as early as July. Premier Dwight Ball stated that \"first and foremost, any final decision that would be made on this would be have to be made in consultation with our public health officials.\"[174] On June 24, 2020, the Council of Atlantic Premiers announced that they had agreed to form a travel corridor, the \"Atlantic Bubble\", which would allow residents of the Atlantic provinces to travel between them without being required to self-isolate on arrival. The agreement would begin on July 3[34] On November 23, 2020, amid an increase in cases, Premier Andrew Furey announced that Newfoundland would suspend its participation in the Atlantic Bubble for 14 days. Essential travel by residents of Atlantic provinces would not require an exemption, but became subject to a self-isolation requirement.[45] On December 7, Premier Furey ruled out plans to rejoin the bubble until at least 2021, as other provinces also began to suspend their participation due to local spikes.[175] On March 18, 2021, plans were announced to reform the Atlantic Bubble no earlier than April 19, although this was later delayed to May due to outbreaks and lockdowns in New Brunswick.[176][177] Newfoundland and Labrador suspended their involvement in the Atlantic Bubble in September 2021 due to growing case numbers in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as well as Newfoundland and Labrador's change in epidemiology.[178] Newfoundland and Labrador opened their borders to the rest of the country on July 1, 2021. Fully-vaccinated travelers did not need to isolate, as long as they uploaded their vaccination documents to the province's travel form. Partially-vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers would have to isolate for the full 14 days, unless they get tested on day 7. If the test result returns negative, the traveler may leave isolation.[179] However, on December 21, 2021, in response to growing case numbers that were non-epidemiologically linked, meaning there were signs of community transmission within N.L., Dr. Janice Fitzgerald announced that anyone entering the province, regardless of their vaccination status or province of residency, will have to isolate. Fully-vaccinated travelers have to isolate for five days and take a rapid test each day; if each rapid test returns a negative result, the traveler may leave isolation after their five days, or if 120 hours have passed. Partially-vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers have no changes to their isolation requirements, however, they are given rapid tests to complete on a voluntary basis.[180] The Liberal Party delayed its leadership election from May to August as a result of the pandemic.[181]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Newfoundland and Labrador - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10669","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Newfoundland_and_Labrador"}
