The patient was an elderly woman who had been hospitalized two days before.[4] On 17 March, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of emergency in the entire country.[5] Bosnia and Herzegovina has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 deaths in the world as well as one of the lowest test rates in Europe.[6] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[7][8] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[9][10] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[11][9] Up until 25 February 12 people were under surveillance as suspected cases.[12] In Sarajevo, three Chinese tourists who were showing symptoms had negative test results for the virus.[13] On 2 March, a man from Tomislavgrad was suspected to have brought the virus from Italy, and was sent to Mostar for a health checkup.

Every Bosnian citizen arriving to the country is obligated to self-quarantine for 14 days starting from the day of arrival. Tents will be set up on the northern border with Croatia.[36] On 15 March 2020, Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision which forbids for foreign nationals entering Bosnia and Herzegovina to enter from areas with intensive transmission of virus coronas, and especially from: Provinces of the PRC (Wuhan), South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, France, Romania, Germany, Austria, Spain, Switzerland and Belgium.[37] On 24 March 2020, Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision which bans entrance for all foreigners, and also from 30 March 2020 all borders at airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina will be closed for passengers, and airplanes could land only to deliver cargo.[38] On 21 May 2020, Council of Minister adopted a decision which allows entry and stay of a foreigner who enters Bosnia and Herzegovina due to business obligations, provided that they have an invitation letter from a legal entity from Bosnia and Herzegovina that hires them in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a certificate of a negative test for SARS-CoV-2 virus from an authorized laboratory, not older than 48 hours from the time of entry.[39] Citizens of Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia can enter Bosnia and Herzegovina without any additional condition from 1 June 2020.[40] The effects of restrictive measures and their relaxation were scientifically analyzed.

The Ministry of Health and Social Security ordered the disinfection of all public spaces and property.[60] Student dormitories in the city of Banja Luka were evacuated for immediate disinfection.[61] On 10 March 2020, Republika Srpska had officially enacted a ban on all public gatherings, shut down all schools, and banned entry to all tourists coming from any of the COVID-19 infected countries across the world to contain the spread of the virus within the country.[62] Between 12 and 13 March, numerous cities have made decisions to limit the work of grocery stores, restaurants, cafés and completely limit the work of gyms and fitness centers.

Members of the Board of the Tourism and Hospitality Group of the Foreign Trade Chamber of Bosnia and Herzegovina have warned that the situation in tourism as a sector was sensitive to global disruptions and the emergence of a new coronavirus strain could lead to the collapse of all entities operating in the tourism and hospitality sector.[152] Macroeconomic simulations in the report \"COVID-19 Analysis Economic Consequences for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Measures and Solutions\" by Admir Čavalić, Faruk Hadžić and Damir Bećirović show that BiH, ceteris paribus, will face a GDP decline in 2020 ranging from 3.97% to 9.53%. Worst-case scenario foresees by the end of the year the rise in the number of unemployed to 96,767. Applying measures indicated in the analysis in a timely manner, it would be possible to reduce this number to 33,284 unemployed. The analysis emphasizes current negative macroeconomic trends in BIH (instability of pension systems, economic slowdown to 2.8% in 2019, migratory trends with estimated 50,000 people leaving Bosnia annually) which makes the country very vulnerable to the current crisis. The strongest impact is expected in the healthcare and unemployment benefits sector. Specific financial burden pertains to government intervention aimed at stabilizing the economy. It is estimated that at least two billion KM (more than \u20ac1 billion) will be required for this purpose.[153] From 21 March, most of the sports activities were canceled across the entire country, including all football matches in all categories.[154] The countries and international organizations that have sent aid and funds to Bosnia and Herzegovina, to help fight the pandemic:","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10582","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina"}
