First, they try to raze a few kilometers of area with air and artillery fire and advance with ground troops. When they gain strength, they retreat and start shooting with long-range weapons. On the other hand, when they start hitting with cannons, we retreat and then return to our positions. They cannot finish us. Reinforcements also came to our rescue. 20 percent of the city is under our control again. Currently, the clashes are taking place in the city center.
