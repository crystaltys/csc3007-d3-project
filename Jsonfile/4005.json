{"Content: ":"Hyde Park is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States, bordering the Hudson River north of Poughkeepsie. Within the town are the hamlets of Hyde Park, East Park, Staatsburg, and Haviland. Hyde Park is known as the hometown of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. His house there, now the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, as are the homes of Eleanor Roosevelt, Isaac Roosevelt, and Frederick William Vanderbilt, along with Haviland Middle School (formerly Franklin D. Roosevelt High School). Hyde Park is home to the main campus of the Culinary Institute of America, a four-year college for culinary and baking and pastry arts, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, the first presidential library in the United States. Hyde Park's population was 21,021 at the 2020 United States Census.[2] U.S. Route 9 passes through the town near the Hudson River. Settlement of the region by Europeans officially began around 1742 but may have begun as early as 1710. The name of the area was changed to \"Hyde Park\" around 1810. Previously, it was part of the Fauconnier Patent and was named \"Stoutenburgh\", after the town's first settler, Jacobus Stoughtenburg. Part of the town was from the Great Nine Partners Patent of 1697. Doctor John Bard had called his estate \"Hyde Park\" in honor of Edward Hyde, who was Lord Cornbury and governor of New York from 1702 to 1708. In 1697, Hyde granted nine close friends of his a large swatch of land \"south of Albany\" in the Great Nine Partners Patent, which would eventually make up much of Hyde Park.[3] In 1804 a tavern-keeper named Miller, seeking new guests, renamed the tavern \"the Hyde Park Inn\", much to the annoyance of Doctor Bard. He then applied for a post office to be located at his inn, common among tavern keepers. The request was granted as the \"Hyde Park Post Office\". The settlement gradually came to be known not as Stoutenburgh but as Hyde Park, which it officially became in 1812. Hyde Park was a part of Clinton, New York until 1821 when it was incorporated as a separate town. The Hyde Park Railroad Station, located at the mouth of Crum Elbow Creek along the Hudson River, was used by the town's residents, including the Roosevelts. The town includes Frederick William Vanderbilt's spring and autumn mansion, now maintained as the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site. Hyde Park is the hometown of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882\u20131945), who served as president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945.[4] His estate, Springwood, is the site of the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site maintained by the National Park Service. Also on the site are his presidential library and museum.[4] Roosevelt used this residence throughout his life. FDR's historical house is now a museum that can be visited. Val-Kill was the home of Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is located about 2 miles (3 km) east of the home of FDR.[5] Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt are both buried in the rose garden at \"Springwood\".[6] President Roosevelt's father, James Roosevelt, Sr., served a term as supervisor of the town of Hyde Park.
