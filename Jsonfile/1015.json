{"Content: ":"Steropodon is a genus of prehistoric monotreme, or egg-laying mammal. It contains a single species, Steropodon galmani, that lived about 105 to 93.3 million years ago (mya) in the Early to Late Cretaceous period. It is one of the oldest monotremes discovered, and is one of the oldest Australian mammal discoveries. The dentition of Steropodon is somewhat similar to that of therians\u2014the placentals and the marsupials\u2014specifically the presence of the tribosphenic molar tooth which was thought to be exclusive to therians since the Cretaceous. This, along with the tribosphenic molar discoveries of monotreme-relatives Ausktribosphenos and Ambondro mahabo of which the latter evolved in the Jurassic, led to the conclusion that the molar evolved independently in the two lineages. This inspired the creation of the subclasses Australosphenida\u2014the monotremes and extinct relatives\u2014and Tribosphenida\u2014placentals and marsupials. However, given this classification is based only on jaw and lower-tooth remains, insufficient evidence may exist to definitively make this conclusion.[2] It may be only described member of the family Steropodontidae. Another proposed member is Teinolophos that was moved into its own family, Teinolophidae, by Flannery et al. (2022).[3] Edentulous partial mandible from the Finch Clay facies of the Griman Creek Formation was attributed to undescribed steropodontid by Musser (2013).[4] On other side, Flannery et al. assumed that this mandible may belong to a new genus and species of stem ornithorhynchid.[3] The specific epithet is derived from the surname of the jaw's collectors, when combined with the genus name Steropodon is intended to translate as \"Galman's lightning tooth\".[5] Steropodon is known only from a single opalised jaw with three molars, discovered at the Griman Creek Formation, Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia, by brothers David and Alan Galman. It was a large mammal for the Mesozoic, being 40\u201350 centimetres (16\u201320 in) long. The lower molars are 5\u20137 millimetres (0.20\u20130.28 in) in length, with a width of 3\u20134 millimetres (0.12\u20130.16 in). A length of 1\u20132 centimetres (0.39\u20130.79 in) is more typical for Mesozoic mammals.[6] Woodburne (2003, p. 212) reports that the holotype is a right mandible named AM F66763. The preserved molars are m1\u2013m3. Examination of the jaw fragment revealed a mandibular canal, which has been proposed to indicate the presence of a bill, similar to those of the extinct species Obdurodon dicksoni and the modern platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus.
