In December 2017, the team announced that Corendon Airlines, a Turkish-Dutch airline company, and Circus, a Belgian betting company had signed three-year sponsorship deals. Circus, who also sponsor the UCI Continental team, ERA\u2013Circus announced they would continue to do so until the end of the cyclo-cross season in March.[1] For the 2020 season the team rebranded itself as Alpecin\u2013Fenix with German shampoo brand Alpecin and Italian interior design materials company Fenix becoming major sponsors for the team.[2] On May 16th 2022, the team announced that it would become Alpecin-Deceuninck for the start of the 2022 Tour de France on a 5 year deal bringing them in line with Alpecin and Canyon. This allowed the team to apply for a 2023-25 World Tour licence. The Fenix logo moved to the back of the shorts where Deceuninck used to be.
