{"Content: ":"The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, better known as Independent SAGE is a group of scientists, unaffiliated to government (although some are also in the government SAGE), that publishes advice aimed toward the UK government regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Its name is based on SAGE, the name of the government's official Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The questions raised about the transparency of SAGE[1] and possible political interference[2][3] during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom led to concerns about trust in public health messaging being raised by scientists and by the media. As an alternative, a group of scientists created Independent SAGE, chaired by Sir David Anthony King, a former Government Chief Scientific Advisor, in early May 2020 to \"provide a clear structure on which an effective policy should be based given the inevitability that the virus will continue to cross borders\".[4] The non-profit group The Citizens were a founding partner with Independent SAGE in May 2020.[5] They continue to support Independent SAGE's social media and web presence. In May 2020, Independent SAGE warned against ending lockdown prematurely in places like schools.[6] In July 2020, they published a strategy pressing the UK government to achieve \u2018zero Covid,\u2019 stating \u2018The prospect of many thousands of further deaths from COVID-19 over the next nine months is unacceptable,' although in the same report they noted only one infectious disease - smallpox - has ever been successfully eliminated. [7] In September 2020, Independent SAGE called for immediate government action to prevent further increase in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, to prevent the need for a second national lockdown.[8] In November 2020, Sir David King stated that he was considering continuing Independent SAGE's work after the coronavirus pandemic, with a focus on combatting climate change.[9]   This article about a UK medical organisation, hospital, or association is a stub.
