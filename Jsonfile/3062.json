Following the couple's split, producer and writer Kid Harpoon encouraged Styles to deal with his emotions by writing about them.[6] During the recording Styles was inspired by David Bowie, Van Morrison, Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell. The latter's album Blue (1971) and its use of the dulcimer, particularly influenced the album's musical style. Styles tracked down the woman who built the dulcimer used in Mitchell's album and requested lessons; she would go on to build Styles his own dulcimer which was used during the album's recording.[6] Styles used \"mushrooms\" during the recording process.[7] The album was released on 13 December 2019, by Columbia and Erskine, Styles' second to be released under the label.

Styles allowed fans to pre-order his album and rewarded them with a code to have a chance to buy tickets to see him at his one-night-only show for only $25.[17] The show in Los Angeles was followed by another show at the Electric Ballroom in London on 19 December with British rapper Stormzy as a special guest.[18] The planned concert tour, Love On Tour, in support of the album,[19] was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the dates of the US leg of the tour were later rescheduled for fall 2021.[20] \"Lights Up\", the lead single from the album, was released on 11 October 2019, debuting at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart.[21][22] The song features a \"soft-touch re-entry into the pop slipstream\", according to music writer Jon Caramanica.[23] The song debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100.[24] On 2 December, Styles revealed the trailer for the album's second single, \"Adore You\".

Larson of Pitchfork described the \"actual sound\" of Fine Line as \"incredible\" as Styles' influences permeate the record, but considered his songwriting shallow and lacking in imagination.[41] Tom Hull wrote similarly that it \"seems pointless even when he comes up with something catchy \u2013 actually, the catchier, the more annoying it gets.\"[59] Fine Line debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 478,000 album-equivalent units (of which 393,000 are pure sales) in the week ending 19 December.
