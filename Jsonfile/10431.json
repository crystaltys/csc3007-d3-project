Of Brunei's first 50 cases, 45 were related to Jamek Mosque.[4] The pandemic had spread to all districts of Brunei.[2] On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[5][6] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[7][8] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[9][7] On 9 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed that preliminary coronavirus tests had returned positive for a 53-year-old male who had returned from a tabligh in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 3 March.[1][12] The patient began to experience symptoms on 7 March, and was eventually moved to the National Isolation Centre in Tutong for treatment.

People awaiting their second dose and vulnerable groups, namely: the elderly, pregnant women and disabled people, would be prioritised until the supply situation improves;[44][45][46] the next day the Ministry announced that they were currently in negotiations with Singapore in an attempt to perform a vaccine trade with the city-state, however the situation is proving to be difficult as Brunei would also need to apply for approval from the vaccine manufacturers in addition to the government of Singapore.[47][45] Brunei has stopped daily reporting of COVID-19 cases in the country, effective 22 June. [48] In late January, Brunei announced entry restrictions for people coming from China.[49] Starting February 1, temperature screening was implemented on entry to the country.

The Ministry has also stepped up efforts to track more close contacts of positive cases.[17] On 15 March, the Bruneian Government barred all citizens and foreign residents from leaving as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health has also banned mass gatherings including weddings and sporting events. In addition the National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam, the Tutong District Amateur Football Association League, and the Brunei Basketball Association suspended all matches and games.[18][19] On 16 March, the Ministry of Religious Affairs announced a one-week closure for all mosques in the country, from 17 March until 23 March, and the Friday prayers which coincided with this time were suspended.[20][51] However, the adhan or Islamic prayer calls would still be conducted.[20] The Bruneian Government also announced that the Temburong Bridge would be opened on the following day, earlier than scheduled, to ease travelling to the Temburong District exclave after the government announced outbound travel ban.[20][52] Previously, commuters have to drive through the Malaysian Limbang District or take passenger ferry services. At initial opening, the bridge was opened from 6 am to 10 pm and traffic is only allowed for Brunei-registered vehicles.[53] However, on the first day of opening, citizens were seen flocking to Temburong, taking advantage of the bridge for pleasure purposes. The government then changed the opening time of the bridge to 6 am to 6 pm as a precautionary measure to reduce the spread of COVID.[54] On 23 May 2020 the opening hours of the bridge were extended back to their original times.[55][56]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Brunei - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10431","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Brunei"}
