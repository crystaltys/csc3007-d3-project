{"Content: ":"Chondrosteidae /ˌkɒndroʊstiˈaɪdiː/ is a family of extinct actinopterygian fishes in the order Acipenseriformes.[3][4] It comprises the Early Jurassic European genera Chondrosteus, Gyrosteus, and Strongylosteus.[5] Included species were of large size, with body lengths ranging from 2 metres (6.6 ft) up to 7 metres (23 ft). Their skeleton was largely made up of bones (unlike living chondrosteans), but ossification was reduced compared to other ray-fins.[6] Chondrosteidae are related with the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Asian family Peipiaosteidae, and with living sturgeon and paddlefish (Acipenseroidei).[6] The Early Triassic Eochondrosteus from China is more basal than all other aforementioned acipenseriforms.[7]   This order Acipenseriformes (Sturgeon and Paddlefish) related article is a stub.
