{"Content: ":"Marienturm is a skyscraper in Frankfurt, Germany. Completed in 2019, it has a height of 155 meters, making it the 15th tallest building in Frankfurt besides Deutsche Bank towers as of 2022. Located in the Bankenviertel, the building was built between 2015 and 2019 by real estate developer Pecan Development GmbH, and is primarily used for office space.[1] The building's contractor is Hochtief.[2] The tower is part of the Marinsel project, which also contains a ten-story office building called the Marienforum.[3] The supporting structure of the building is a reinforced concrete skeleton, consisting of a flat reinforced concrete slab on each floor, and reinforced concrete columns that are arranged on the outside in the floor plan, and four reinforced concrete core areas. These serve for horizontal stiffening and are coupled to one another via the corridor ceilings and beams.[3] The interior design is inspired by the nearby Tausanlage Park.[4] The building contains a 17-metre-high lobby that acts as a transit zone between working environments and nature. This is assissted by contrasting materials, such as wood, stone, marble, and metal, and unique patterns and textures. The Marienforum has a similarly inspired design, albeit with different materials. Usage In addition to commercial office space, a restaurant, a fitness studio, a children's day-care center and 267 underground car parks, including 77 parking spaces with electrical charging stations. The building has won several architectural awards, including the German Design Award in 2018.[5] ","Title":"Marienturm - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6533","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienturm"}
