{"Content: ":"Ukrainian volunteer battalions (Ukrainian: Добровольчі батальйони, romanized: Dobrovolchi bataliony, more formally Добровольчі військові формування України, Dobrovolchi viiskovi formuvannia Ukrainy, 'Volunteer military formations of Ukraine', or abbreviated Добробати, Dobrobaty) were militias and paramilitary groups mobilized as a response to the perceived state of weakness and unwillingness of the regular Armed Forces to counter rising separatism in spring 2014.[1] They trace their origins to the \"Maidan Self-Defense\" militias formed during the Euromaidan in 2013.[2] The earliest of these volunteer units were later formalized into military, special police and paramilitary formations in a response to Russian military intervention in Ukraine.[3][4] Most of the formations were formed or placed under command of government agencies of Ministry of Internal Affairs \u2014 as \"Special Tasks Patrol Police\" \u2014 and Ministry of Defence \u2014 as \"Territorial defence battalions\". There was minority of battalions that were independent. Most of the Battalions initially didn't receive money from the government and were self-funded, some were backed by Ukrainian oligarchs[5] while others received donations or started internet crowdfunding campaigns.[6][7][8] As of September 2014, 37 volunteer battalions took active part in battles of the War in Donbas.[9] Some of the battalion fighters are former Euromaidan activists, but their social background is highly diverse. They include students and military officers.[10] They enjoy a high level of support in Ukrainian society ranked second among the most respected institutions in the country. However, their close ties with Ukrainian oligarchs bring up a high risk of the volunteer formations becoming politicized or turning into private armies.[5] Ordered to leave the front lines in 2015, the volunteer battalion phenomenon was largely over within a year of its beginning.[11] Most units kept existing but were fully integrated as units of either the Ukrainian Army or the National Guard of Ukraine. Since spring 2014, Ministry of Defence had formed 32 volunteer battalions. The ones under the Ministry of Defence command were officially named the \"Territorial Defence Battalions\".[12] At the end of 2014, territorial defence battalions were reorganized as motorized infantry battalions.[13] The idea of the territorial defence battalions, however, remained and in 2021 the Territorial Defense Forces were later created as a more formal and structured version of the territorial defence battalions.[14] Besides territorial defence battalions, several regular units of Armed Forces of Ukraine were formed from volunteers, such as 3rd Airmobile Battalion \"Phoenix\" or 54th Reconnaissance Battalion \"UNSO\".[4] In 2015 the 46th Spetsnaz Battalion \"Donbas Ukraine\" was created from volunteers of Donbas Battalion who decided to switch from National Guard of Ukraine to Armed Forces. According to Interior Minister Avakov, by mid-April 2016 205 service personnel of the ministry's volunteer battalions had been killed in action, National Guardsmen included.[15] Ministry of Internal Affairs had established 56 special tasks patrol police units sized from company to battalion.[16] After several reorganizations, this number shrunk to 33 units.[12] Notable Units formed between 2014 and 2015 include: The National Guard of Ukraine, subordinated to Ministry of Internal Affairs, had established several reserve battalions, among which were Donbas Battalion and General Kulchytskiy Battalion formed from volunteers and Maidan activists.[17] Notable Units formed between 2014 and 2015 include: The following battalions were not controlled by either the Ministry of Internal Affairs nor the Ministry of Defense, but independently operate. Right Sector had formed several battalions that are known as Ukrainian Volunteer Corps.[18] In spring 2015 there were attempts to integrate Ukrainian Volunteer Corps into the Ukrainian Army or National Guard.[3] Battalion of \"Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\" was operating in the area of Pisky, Donetsk.[19] The battalion was disbanded in September 2019; as one of the last units composed purely of volunteer soldiers.[20] A unit specialized in aerial reconnaissance and drone warfare.[21] Aerorozvidka was nicknamed a \"war startup\" by some observers,[22] it began as a group of volunteer drone and IT enthusiasts. It used commercial drones to help the Ukrainian military forces.[22] It was later integrated into the Ukrainian Ground Forces. The Noman Çelebicihan Battalion was one of the three reported battalions with majority Muslim membership.[23] It was composed mostly of ethnic Crimean Tatars and was based in the Kherson region bordering Crimea.[24] It did not participate in any combat operations. The battalion was formed and disbanded in 2016. Many of its members later joined other volunteer battalions or enlisted in the Ukrainian army. The battalion reportedly received assistance from Turkey.[25] The foreign fighter movement in 2014 was largely short-lived, with researcher Kacper Rekawek writing, \"fighters arrived throughout the summer of 2014, and most of them were gone from Ukraine at some point in 2015, although some returned later, with a small group settling in Ukraine permanently.\"[26] By the end of 2015, Rekawek notes, \"both sides took steps to professionalise their forces and incorporate the bottom-up organised volunteer battalions into e.g. the Ukrainian National Guard or, in the case of the 'separatists,' into the 'army corps.' This effectively meant an end to foreign fighter recruitment for this conflict and very few (new) foreigners joined either side after the end of 2015.\"[26] On 6 October 2014 the Ukrainian parliament voted to allow foreign fighters to join the Ukrainian military. That December, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko promised that foreign fighters who join the Ukrainian military will receive citizenship. However, the Kyiv Post reported that by October 2015, only one foreign fighter from Russia had been granted citizenship. The same month, 30 foreign fighters (from Belarus, Georgia, and Russia) rallied in Kyiv for Ukrainian citizenship.[27] An analysis of foreign fighters by Arkadiusz Legieć, a Senior Analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, estimated that about 17,241 foreign fighters fought in Ukraine between 2014 and 2019. 3,879 of those foreign fighters supported Ukraine and joined foreign volunteer battalions. The largest group of foreign fighters in Ukraine was approximately 3,000 Russian citizen volunteers. The second-largest group consisted of approximately 300 Belarussians. The third-largest group consisted of approximately 120 Georgians. The only other country to exceed 50 foreign fighters was Croatia, with approximately 60 fighters. Other countries whose nationals supported Ukraine included Albania (15), Australia (5), Austria (35), Azerbaijan (20), Belgium (1), Bosnia and Herzegovina (5), Bulgaria (6), Canada (10), Czech Republic (5), Denmark (15), Estonia (10), Finland (15), France (15), Germany (15), Greece (2), Ireland (7), Israel (15), Italy (35), Latvia (8), Lithuania (15), Moldova (15), Kosovo (4), Netherlands (3), North Macedonia (4), Norway (10), Poland (10), Portugal (1), Romania (4), Serbia (6), Slovakia (8), Sweden (25), Turkey (30), the United Kingdom (10), and the United States (15).[28][better source needed] The Georgian National Legion is a paramilitary unit formed of more than 700 soldiers, mostly ethnic Georgian volunteers fighting on the side of Ukraine in the War in Donbas and Russian invasion of Ukraine. The unit was organized in 2014 with the declared aim \"to stand up to Russian aggression\". The group is commanded by Mamuka Mamulashvili, a veteran Georgian officer. There are also members of Georgian national legion that had experience from the Chechen wars. After the start of Russian invasion of Ukraine more people of different nationalities applied to join Georgian National Legion.The GNL has been seen multiple times in news reports and interviews and can be seen as one of the more know Volunteer battalions. The Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion, originally named the \"Chechen battalion\", was set up in March 2014 and is one of the three reported majority Muslim battalions formed.[23] It was later named after Chechnya's first president and leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and it is based in Novomoskovsk in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[29] As of late May 2015, the unit was in the process of being legalized as part of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry.[29] Its Ukrainian members will join the Zoloti Borota Battalion, while its foreign members are expected to join army units under a bill enabling foreign fighters to get Ukrainian citizenship.[29] Most of the members are ethnic Ukrainians, but there are also Chechens from European countries as well as from Chechnya and it also includes other Muslims like Azerbaijanis, Ingush and Tatars, as well as Georgians.[29] The battalion \"views the war as part of a broader struggle against Russian imperialism and the Kadyrov regime\".[30] The battalion specializes in counter-subversion.[29] Tactical Group \"Belarus\" was a volunteer group of Belarusian nationals who were part of the Ukrainian volunteer battalions. The Sheikh Mansur Battalion is one of the three reported majority Muslim battalions formed.[23] It was reported as defending the front line near Mariupol in 2015.[31] It was created by former Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion members.[29] The battalion was disbanded in September 2019; as one of the last units composed purely of volunteer soldiers.[20] However, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the battalion was reported to be active again.[32][33][34] In 2022, the former Territorial defence battalions were reoganized into a more formal and structured independent branch of the armed forces known as the Territorial Defense Forces.[14] They serve as a spiritual successor of the volunteer battalions, allowing local civilian volunteers to join and do local territorial defense against an invasion.[14] Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by forces of the Russian Federation, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged foreign volunteers to travel to Ukrainian embassies across the world to join a new 'International Brigade' of the Ukrainian armed forces. Freedom of Russia Legion was formed following the 2022 invasion, which made up of defectors of the Russian armed forces. The legion also reportedly consists of volunteers from the Russian opposition.","Title":"Ukrainian volunteer battalions - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16587","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_volunteer_battalions"}
