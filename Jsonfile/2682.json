{"Content: ":"The Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum is a 9th-century peace agreement between Alfred of Wessex and Guthrum, the Viking ruler of East Anglia. It sets out the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrum's territories as well as agreements on peaceful trade, and the weregild value of its people. In 866 the Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia with the intention of conquering all the English kingdoms. During their campaign, the Viking army conquered the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria and although initially, they overran the kingdom of Wessex, the Danish king Guthrum was defeated by Alfred's army at the Battle of Edington in 878.[1] Under the terms of his surrender, shortly after, Guthrum was obliged to be baptised[a] (to endorse the agreement, plus allow him to rule more legitimately over his Christian vassals, while remaining pagan to his pagan vassals) and then with his army leave Wessex. The agreement whereby Guthrum surrendered, was baptised and agreed to leave Wessex is known as the Treaty of Wedmore.[3] Sometime[b] after Wedmore a treaty was agreed that set out the lasting peace terms between the two kings, this is known as the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum. The treaty is one of the few existing documents[c] of Alfred's reign; it survives in Old English in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Manuscript 383, and in a Latin compilation known as Quadripartitus.[6][7] The date when the treaty was created is not known for sure, but is believed to have been between 878[b] and Guthrum's death in 890.[2] The prologue to the treaty was a legitimization of the territory held by both parties. It legitimized Guthrum's landholdings in East Anglia and Alfred's in Mercia.[8] Clause 2 and 3 specify the blood money (or weregild), that is the value of men based on their status.[8] The other clauses are concerned with the purchase of men, horses and oxen. There is also provision for hostages as a guarantee of good faith for one side trading with the other.[9]  The original document was written in Old English; the following translation is by Frederick Attenborough[d] Prologue: These are the terms of peace which King Alfred and King Guthrum, and the councillors of all the English nation, and all the people who dwell in East Anglia, have all agreed upon and confirmed with oaths, on their own behalf and for their subjects both living and unborn, who are anxious for Gods favour and ours.","Title":"Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum - Wikipedia","KeyID":"2682","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Alfred_and_Guthrum"}
