{"Content: ":"Still Standing is an American sitcom created by Diane Burroughs and Joey Gutierrez, that ran on CBS from September 30, 2002, to March 8, 2006. It starred Mark Addy and Jami Gertz as Bill and Judy Miller, a working-class couple living in Chicago. Taylor Ball, Renee Olstead, and Soleil Borda portrayed their children and Jennifer Irwin portrayed Judy's sister Linda. A working-class couple in Chicago tries to instill good values in their three kids, Brian (Taylor Ball), Lauren (Renee Olstead), and Tina (Soleil Borda), but their own past experiences often conflict with the lessons they teach their children. Judy Miller (Jami Gertz) is the attractive wife, who was wooed by Bill (Mark Addy). Judy's sister Linda (Jennifer Irwin) continuously butts heads with Bill. Each of the episode titles begins with the word \"Still\", with the exception of the pilot. The show entered off-network syndication in 2006, and in the fall of that year 20th Television put it into barter-syndication. It aired on many affiliates, most notably MyNetworkTV and The CW. Lifetime Television acquired the cable rights from 2006 to 2009. ABC Family acquired the rights to rerun it in the Fall of 2010, but due to low ratings, it was removed from their lineup. The show returned to ABC Family (now Freeform), from December 2013 to June 2014, before it was ultimately replaced by The Middle. As of 2021, the show has not aired on any cable channels since then. A 2002 Entertainment Weekly review gave Still Standing a \"D\" grade, calling it an \"apathetic\" show that \"does zip to freshen the Fatty-Gets-a-Family formula.\"[1]","Title":"Still Standing (American TV series) - Wikipedia","KeyID":"18595","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Standing_(American_TV_series)"}
