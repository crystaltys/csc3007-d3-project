{"Content: ":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Senegal is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Senegal on March 2, 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[2][3] The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[4][5] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[6][4] Model-based simulations for Senegal suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t exceeded 1.0 from November 2020 to January 2021.[7]  In Senegal, graffiti artists engage actively in the fight against the coronavirus, by creating murals relating to COVID-19 on city walls, to spread information and warn the population and also to support healthcare personnel confronting the disease.[58]","Title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Senegal - Wikipedia","KeyID":"10324","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Senegal"}
