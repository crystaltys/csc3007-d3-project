{"Content: ":"In classical music from Western culture, an augmented third (Play (help·info)) is an interval of five semitones. It may be produced by widening a major third by a chromatic semitone.[1][3] For instance, the interval from C to E is a major third, four semitones wide, and both the intervals from C♭ to E, and from C to E♯ are augmented thirds, spanning five semitones. Being augmented, it is considered a dissonant interval.[4] Its inversion is the diminished sixth, and its enharmonic equivalent is the perfect fourth. The just augmented third, E♯, is 456.99 cents or 125:96. Play (help·info) The Pythagorean augmented third, E♯+++, is 521.51 cents or 177147:131072, eleven just perfect fifths.
