{"Content: ":"Matteo Jorgenson (born July 1, 1999) is an American professional cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Movistar Team.[2] He had an active 2022 Tour de France and was involved in several breakaways including on stage 10, a stage where his parents were able to be in attendance. He finished 4th, a result he was not satisfied with. On stage 16 there was a large breakaway of nearly 30 riders and Jorgenson was among them. Late in the stage he was one of the final surviving riders and was in the process of chasing down the lead rider Hugo Houle. Unfortunately he crashed while rounding a sharp corner and when he remounted his bike he was visibly bleeding from his arm and leg. Despite the crash he was still able to finish 4th on the stage.[3] This biographical article relating to American cycling is a stub.
