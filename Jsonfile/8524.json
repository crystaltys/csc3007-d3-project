{"Content: ":"One-day races and Classics Lennard Kämna (born 9 September 1996) is a German professional road racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Bora\u2013Hansgrohe.[4] He rode with Team Stölting in 2015, before his team and Cult Energy Pro Cycling merged for the 2016 season.[5][6][7] At the age of 14, Kämna left his family home in Bremen to attend a sports school in Cottbus.[8] In 2014, he became the junior world champion in the individual time trial at the UCI Road World Championships,[9] having already won the German and European championships at the same level earlier in the year.[1] A year later, he finished third in the under-23 time trial at the World Championships in Richmond. His effort was impeded by strong winds and light rain, a fact that benefited first and second placed Mads Würtz Schmidt and Maximilian Schachmann, who both started earlier in the day.[10] In June 2015, he also became the German under-23 champion in the time trial.[11] In his first year as a professional, he won the German under-23 Bundesliga and became German mountain champion (Deutsche Bergmeisterschaften).[12][13] On 14 September 2016, Kämna won the gold medal in the under-23 time trial event at the European Road Championships in Plumelec, France.[14] He was named in the startlist for the 2017 Vuelta a España,[15] and completed 17 stages of the race. At the 2017 UCI Road World Championships, Kämna was part of the Team Sunweb squad that took the gold medal in the men's team time trial competition, and went on to claim the silver medal in the under-23 road race behind Benoît Cosnefroy. In June 2018 Sunweb announced that Kämna would take a break from cycle racing \"reflect on his long-term career goals\", having not raced since Milan-San Remo earlier that year due to illness.[8] In July 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Tour de France.[16] Kämna took his first senior individual race win at the 2020 Critérium du Dauphiné, where he won the fourth stage. Shortly afterwards he rode the 2020 Tour de France, where he took his first Grand Tour stage win on stage 16 of the race, attacking a reducing lead group on the penultimate climb and being joined by Richard Carapaz, and subsequently countering an attack by Carapaz and building up a lead on the descent and the last climb to win by one and a half minutes.[17] He had previously narrowly missed out on the win on the thirteenth stage of the race, losing out in the final sprint to Daniel Martínez at the summit finish on Puy Mary.[18]","Title":"Lennard Kämna - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8524","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard_Kamna"}
