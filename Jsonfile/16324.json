On May 3, the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal announced that a platform for fundraising in support of Ukraine will be launched soon:[1] \"Everyone in the world can make a donation and help Ukraine fight for our freedom. We want to unite the world around the support of our state. Ordinary people, charitable foundations, international companies, opinion leaders around the world. The creation of the platform is also necessary to demonstrate maximum transparency and openness in the use of funds raised: where and to whom they are directed.\"[2] On May 5, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the launch of the United24 global initiative, the first component of which is an online platform to raise funds to support the state.
