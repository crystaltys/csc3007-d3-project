{"Content: ":"Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bednov (Russian: Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Бедно́в, Ukrainian: Олекса́ндр Олекса́ндрович Бєдно́в; 29 August 1969 \u2013 1 January 2015) was a former Soviet and Ukrainian militsiya officer and rebel commander of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic in Ukraine.[1] He was the leader of the pro-Russian Batman Rapid Response Group. He was assassinated in Luhansk, with conflicting reports on who was responsible.[2] Bednov commanded the Rapid Response Group \"Batman\" (also known as the Batman Battalion) until he was killed in an attack on his convoy on 1 January 2015.[3] Members of the group said that the attack was ordered by head of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Igor Plotnitsky.[3] According to them, Bednov and his fighters were shot and killed \"by order of Plotnitsky\" because he was \"ordered to sweep all intransigent commanders.\"[4][5] Following this attack, the LPR arrested some of Bednov's men, and dissolved the battalion.[6] Some of its personnel were dispersed into other LPR units, while Donetsk People's Republic field commanders Givi and Motorola invited former members to join their battalions.[6] After Bednov's assassination, Igor Girkin criticized the killing as a \"murder\" and \"gangster ambush\", and suggested that other commanders seriously consider leaving Donbass to Russia, as he did.[7]","Title":"Alexander Bednov - Wikipedia","KeyID":"16560","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bednov"}
