{"Content: ":"One-day races and Classics Christophe Laporte (born 11 December 1992 in La Seyne-sur-Mer) is a French cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Team Jumbo\u2013Visma.[4] Laporte was a member of Cofidis from 2014 to 2021. He was named in the Team Cofidis start list for the Tour de France for seven consecutive years between 2015 and 2021,[5][6] completing all but one of them. In 2022 he joined Jumbo-Visma, among the most powerful teams in cycling, and in his first major stage race with the team led the podium sweep with Primož Roglič and Wout Van Aert on stage 1 of Paris-Nice.[7] In the 2022 Tour de France, he was a key teammate of leader Jonas Vingegaard, was instrumental in helping the team win three different jerseys, and also won stage 19 at Cahors.[8] This was a rare win in that he attacked after the sprint trains were already operating at top speed, and actually held off the remaining elite sprinters long enough to win the stage.","Title":"Christophe Laporte - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8124","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christophe_Laporte"}
