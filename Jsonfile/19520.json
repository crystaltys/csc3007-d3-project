My work in children's books grew out of a desire to explore what I was feeling as a new father.\"[9] He received a Gold Medal from the Society of Illustrators in 1999 for his illustrations in Come On, Rain! by Karen Hesse. Muth created a version of the stone soup fable set in China[10] and illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game.
