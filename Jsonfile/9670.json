{"Content: ":"A viral disease (or viral infection) occurs when an organism's body is invaded by pathogenic viruses, and infectious virus particles (virions) attach to and enter susceptible cells.[1] Basic structural characteristics, such as genome type, virion shape and replication site, generally share the same features among virus species within the same family.[citation needed] Human-infecting virus families offer rules that may assist physicians and medical microbiologists/virologists.[citation needed] As a general rule, DNA viruses replicate within the cell nucleus while RNA viruses replicate within the cytoplasm. Exceptions are known to this rule: poxviruses replicate within the cytoplasm and orthomyxoviruses and hepatitis D virus (RNA viruses) replicate within the nucleus.[citation needed] This group of analysts defined multiple categories of virus. Groups:[citation needed]  The clinical characteristics of viruses may differ substantially among species within the same family: Vertical and sexual[32] Varicella: Zoster: Varicella: Zoster:","Title":"Viral disease - Wikipedia","KeyID":"9670","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"}
