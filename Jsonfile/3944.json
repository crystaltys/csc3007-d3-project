{"Content: ":"This is a list of properties and historic districts in Tennessee that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There are over 2,000 in total. Of these, 29 are National Historic Landmarks. Each of Tennessee's 95 counties has at least one listing. The Tennessee Historical Commission, which manages the state's participation in the National Register program, reports that 80 percent of the state's area has been surveyed for historic buildings. Surveys for archaeological sites have been less extensive; coverage is estimated less than 5 percent of the state. Not all properties that have been determined to be eligible for National Register are listed.[1] The locations of National Register properties and districts (at least for all showing latitude and longitude coordinates below), may be seen in an online map by clicking on \"Map of all coordinates\".[2]  \u2003 \u2003 This National Park Service list is complete through NPS recent listings posted July 15, 2022.[3]  The following are approximate tallies of current listings by county. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008[4] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[5] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis.[6] Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which only modify the area covered by an existing property or district, although carrying a separate National Register reference number. The Tennessee county with the largest number of National Register listings is Davidson County, site of the state capital, Nashville.","Title":"National Register of Historic Places listings in Tennessee - Wikipedia","KeyID":"3944","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Tennessee"}
