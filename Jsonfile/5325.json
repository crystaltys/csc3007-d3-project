{"Content: ":"The 1888 Democratic National Convention was a nominating convention held June 5 to 7, 1888, in the St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall in St. Louis, Missouri. It nominated President Grover Cleveland for reelection and former Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio for vice president. St. Louis won the convention after a presentation in February 1888. Stephen M. White served as temporary chairman and Patrick A. Collins served as the convention's permanent president.[1] The Democratic platform largely confined itself to a defense of the Cleveland administration, supporting reduction in the tariff and taxes generally as well as statehood for the western territories. President Cleveland was renominated by acclamation. An event few could directly remember, as the last time a Democrat was renominated was 48 years earlier, in 1840. Presidents Franklin Pierce and Andrew Johnson lost the nomination in 1852 and 1868 respectively, and Presidents James K. Polk and James Buchanan refused to run for a second term. Former Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio Governor Isaac P. Gray of Indiana U.S. Commissioner of Pensions John C. Black of Illinois After Cleveland was re-nominated, Democrats had to choose a replacement for Thomas A. Hendricks, who had died in office on November 25, 1885. Hendricks had run unsuccessfully as the Democratic nominee for vice-president in 1876, but had won the office when he ran again with Cleveland in 1884. Three names were placed in nomination: Allen G. Thurman, Isaac P. Gray, and John C. Black. Former Senator Thurman of Ohio was nominated for vice-president over Indiana Governor Gray, his nearest rival, and John C. Black, who trailed behind. Gray lost the nomination to Thurman primarily because his enemies brought up his actions while a Republican.[2] ","Title":"1888 Democratic National Convention - Wikipedia","KeyID":"5325","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1888_Democratic_National_Convention"}
