{"Content: ":"Jonathan Castroviejo Nicolás (born 27 April 1987) is a Spanish professional cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Ineos Grenadiers.[6] Born in Getxo, Basque Country, Spain, Castroviejo spent two seasons with the feeder team of the de facto Basque national squad Orbea, before he joined Euskaltel\u2013Euskadi in 2010. He won his first race as a professional at the 2011 Tour de Romandie, clocking the fastest time in the 3.5 km (2.2 mi) prologue individual time trial, beating reigning under-23 world champion Taylor Phinney by 0.27 seconds. The result came the day before Castroviejo's 24th birthday.[7] His prowess in the time trial was relatively uncommon for a Euskaltel\u2013Euskadi rider, as the team was known for fielding lightweight climbers with little ability against the clock. The Romandie stage win was, however, not a complete shock \u2013 earlier in the season, Castroviejo had finished eighth in the time trial which closed out Tirreno\u2013Adriatico, besting the times of riders such as Gustav Larsson, Cadel Evans, and David Zabriskie, all of whom had reputations as time trial specialists.[8] Castroviejo turned in another strong time trial later in the Tour de Romandie, taking ninth in the 20.1 km (12.5 mi) long race against the clock, better than Marco Pinotti and Jean-Christophe Péraud (among others), both former champions of their respective nations in the time trial.[9] Castroviejo moved to the Movistar Team for the 2012 season.[3] He wore the Vuelta a España's general classification jersey for two stages since his team won the opening Team time trial and he crossed the line first, but lost it two days later to teammate Alejandro Valverde. Castroviejo could not follow the frantic pace set by Alberto Contador (Saxo Bank\u2013Tinkoff Bank) on the final climb of the third stage.[10] In 2015, Castroviejo won the Spanish National Time Trial Championships for the second time in his career.[11] On 17 August 2017, it was announced that Castroviejo would join Team Sky for the 2018 season.[12] Media related to Jonathan Castroviejo at Wikimedia Commons","Title":"Jonathan Castroviejo - Wikipedia","KeyID":"8566","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Castroviejo"}
