{"Content: ":"Keith Thomas Jacobs Jr. (February 13, 1935 \u2013 July 9, 2022) was an American professional golfer and golf course owner/operator who played on the PGA Tour and the Champions Tour. He was the older brother of John Jacobs who has also played on the PGA Tour and is a current player on the Champions Tour.[1] Jacobs was born in Denver, Colorado, and raised in southern California, where he started in junior golf. In 1951, Jacobs won the U.S. Junior Amateur. At sixteen, he advanced to the semifinals of the U.S. Amateur, which earned him an invitation to the Masters Tournament at age 17. For 58 years, Jacobs had the distinction of being the youngest golfer to ever play in the Masters (in 1952).[1] The record was broken by Matteo Manassero in 2010. He turned professional in 1956. Jacobs won four PGA Tour events. His first win came in 1958 at the newly revamped Denver Open, and his last was at the 1964 Palm Springs Golf Classic. During his career, Jacobs had sole 2nd-place finishes in two major championships. He lost the 1964 U.S. Open to Ken Venturi by four strokes, and was runner-up in a playoff at the Masters Tournament in 1966 that he (72) and Gay Brewer (78) lost to Jack Nicklaus (70).[2] Jacobs was a member of the 1965 Ryder Cup team, and finished with a record of 3-1-1. Jacobs joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the Champions Tour) in 1985 and continued to play in selected events into the 2000s; his last appearance was at the 2003 Senior PGA Championship.[1] Jacobs and his brother John teamed up with Roger Fredericks, to form Champions Corporate Golf Outings, which provides custom tailored golf events for small to medium size groups and corporations.[1] Jacobs died on July 9, 2022, at the age of 87.[3] PGA Tour playoff record (2\u20132) Amateur Professional CUT = missed the half-way cut (3rd round cut in 1960 and 1964 PGA Championships) R64 = Round in which player lost in match play \"T\" indicates a tie for a place Source for Masters,[4] U.S. Open,[5] Open Championship,[6] British Amateur,[7] PGA Championship[8]","Title":"Tommy Jacobs - Wikipedia","KeyID":"17570","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Jacobs"}
