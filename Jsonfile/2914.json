Her 2020 collaborations \"Stuck with U\" with Justin Bieber and \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

While consistently maintaining pop-R&B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed,[254] thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown.[255] She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that \"one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same.\"[256] Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she \"love[s] being hands on\" with every project, revealing that Mac Miller taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools.[257] Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music \"from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals.\"[258] She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[259] Grande's debut album Yours Truly was complimented for recreating the R&B \"vibe and feel of the 90s\" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[260] Her follow-up record, My Everything, was described as an evolution to a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres.[261] Grande expanded the pop and R&B sound on her third album, Dangerous Woman, which was praised by the Los Angeles Times for integrating elements of different styles, including reggae-pop (\"Side to Side\"), dance-pop (\"Be Alright\"), and guitar-trap fusion (\"Sometimes\").[262] Trap-pop is more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener and Thank U, Next.[254] On Sweetener, Elias Leight of Rolling Stone opines that Grande \"set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming\" and \"embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop\", exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity.[263][264] Craig Jenkins of Vulture noted that Grande changed her musical style to trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on Thank U, Next,[265] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[264] Her sixth album, Positions, further explores the R&B and trap-pop sound of Sweetener and Thank U, Next, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.[266][267] Grande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.[248] She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career, after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[268] Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her biggest vocal influences: \"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well.

I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't. ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do.\"[251] It inspired her to release \"Thank U, Next\" without any prior announcement, which The Ringer called \"more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move.\"[278] Grande is a light lyric soprano,[279][280][281][282] possessing a four-octave vocal range[19][283] and a whistle register.[284] With the release of Yours Truly, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material.[285][286] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have \"the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant.\"[287] Grande responded to the comparisons, \"[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine.\"[271] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, \"With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]\u2014and that's okay.\"[286] Mark Savage of BBC News commented, \"Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control\".[19] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice \"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced.\"[288] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 Time magazine article: \"[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle.\"[289] Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style \"a little boring\" as her career has progressed.[290][291] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[291] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as \"age appropriate\" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[287] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention \"for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings.\"[292] That year, she abandoned her earlier style and began wearing short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events.[293] She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears.[294][295] In recent years, she began wearing oversized jackets and hoodies.[296][297] Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities.[298][299][300][301][302][303][304] After years of dyeing her hair red for the role of Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from the damage.[158][305] Anne T.
