{"Content: ":"Alfred Hermann Fried (German pronunciation: [ˈʔalfʁeːt ˈhɛʁman ˈfʁiːt]; 11 November 1864 \u2013 4 May 1921) was an Austrian Jewish pacifist, publicist, journalist, co-founder of the German peace movement, and winner (with Tobias Asser) of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1911. Fried was also a supporter of Esperanto. He is the author of an Esperanto textbook and an Esperanto-German and German-Esperanto dictionary, first published in 1903 and republished in 1905.[1] Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to a Jewish family, Fried left school at the age of 15 and started to work in a bookshop. In 1883 he moved to Berlin, where he opened a bookshop of his own in 1887. Following the publication by Bertha von Suttner of Die Waffen nieder! (Lay Down Your Arms) in 1889, he and von Suttner began in 1892 to print a magazine of the same name. In articles published within Die Waffen nieder! and its successor, Die Friedenswarte (The Peace Watch), he articulated his pacifist philosophy. In 1892 he was a co-founder of the German Peace Society (Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft). He was one of the fathers of the idea of a modern organisation to assure worldwide peace (the principal idea was developed in the League of Nations and after the Second World War in the UN). Fried was a prominent member of the Esperanto movement. In 1903 he published the book Lehrbuch der internationalen Hilfssprache Esperanto (Textbook of the International Language Esperanto).[1] In 1909 he collaborated with Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine of the Central Office of International Associations in the preparation of the Annuaire de la Vie Internationale.[2] In 1911 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with Tobias Asser. During World War I, Fried moved to neutral Switzerland, and continued to advocate international peace. He died in his hometown, Vienna, in 1921.[3] His ashes are buried at Feuerhalle Simmering.[4]","Title":"Alfred Hermann Fried - Wikipedia","KeyID":"19010","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hermann_Fried"}
