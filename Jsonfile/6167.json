{"Content: ":"Frankfort is a town in Herkimer County, New York, United States. The town is named after one of its earliest settlers, Lawrence (Lewis) Frank.[3] The town of Frankfort includes a village, also called Frankfort. Frankfort is located east of Utica, and the Erie Canal passes along its northern border. At the time of the 2010 census, the population was 7,636.[4] Frankfort is home to the Great American Irish Festival, held within the Herkimer County Fairgrounds.[citation needed] The first European settlers in this area were German Palatines who came to the colony as religious refugees in 1723. During the French and Indian War, this area suffered fierce attacks by the French with their Indian allies, and the settlers abandoned much of the area. The area of the early town was resettled before 1794, by the granting of land patents.[citation needed] After the Revolutionary War, the town of Frankfort was established from part of the town of German Flatts. In 1798, the northwest part of Frankfort was taken away to form part of the town of Deerfield. The Balloon Farm in Frankfort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[5] According to the United States Census Bureau, Frankfort has an area of 36.5 square miles (94.6 km2), of which 36.4 square miles (94.3 km2) are land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2), or 0.29%, are water.[4] The western border of the town is the Oneida County line, and the northern border is the Mohawk River. Moyer Creek and Ferguson Creek flow northward through Frankfort to the Mohawk River.[6] New York State Route 5S runs parallel to the Mohawk River. New York State Route 171 intersects old NY 5S in the village of Frankfort.

Frankfort has a large Italian American population.[9] Many Italian American families in the town and village are descendants of immigrants from Oriolo, Cosenza, or Calabria, Italy and from San Giuseppe Iato, Sicily.[citation needed] The first settler from Oriolo may have been Giuseppe Franchino, who appeared in the 1880 census as Joseph Frank, age 33, birthplace Italy.[citation needed] The Herkimer County Fair is a six-day fair held annually in Frankfort.[11] The fair was started in 1841 as the Herkimer County Agricultural Society, and traveled from village to village. In the 1900s, the fair was located at a site which later became the Hekimer Thruway interchange. At that time, the fair had a racetrack and grandstand which were later destroyed by a fire. After moving to Frankfort in 1950, the fair became an annual event. In 1958, it moved to a permanent site on Cemetery Hill in Frankfort, after buying the Slocum Farm. The fair currently sits on 26 acres (11 ha), and has 10 permanent buildings as well a permanent bathroom, shower facilities, a horse corral, and aluminum bleacher seating surrounding the event show ring.[12]","Title":"Frankfort (town), New York - Wikipedia","KeyID":"6167","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfort_(town),_New_York"}
